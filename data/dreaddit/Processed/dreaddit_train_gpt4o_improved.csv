While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1,"the narrative reveals multiple instances of physical boundary violations and the individual's strong emotional reactions to them. the writer expresses shock and distress when their mother hits them with a newspaper, indicating a lack of expected support and understanding from a close family member. this unexpected behavior from a trusted person can be a significant stressor. the writer's contemplation about sending out a vibe asking for such treatment suggests internal conflict and self-doubt, common indicators of stress. further, the repeated boundary violations by the friend, despite clear communication to stop, and the near-collision incident caused by another friend's impaired driving, contribute to a sense of helplessness and frustration. these experiences cumulatively reflect a pattern of feeling disrespected and unsafe, both physically and emotionally, which are classic signs of stress."

When I'm at work I feel like I really focus in on a task.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and rationalization, suggesting the individual is evaluating their situation logically. the mention of listing things associated with success indicates a structured thought process, typical of someone not overwhelmed by stress. the questioning of whether the navy is exaggerating expectations shows a critical and reflective mindset rather than an anxious one. the individual describes their work as easy and admits to not dedicating excessive time to qualifications, which implies a lack of pressure or urgency. furthermore, the ability to focus on tasks at work suggests cognitive clarity and effective functioning, both of which are inconsistent with high stress levels. overall, the narrative demonstrates a balanced and composed perspective, with no significant indicators of stress-related distress or dysfunction."
I am really feeling like there are no good men. They are all just horrible to women. I think I would rather be alone than deal with any man again. Has anyone else felt like this? Did your feelings ever change?,1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of emotional distress and disillusionment with relationships. the writer expresses a generalized negative perception of men, indicating a deep sense of frustration and possibly betrayal. phrases like ""no good men"" and ""they are all just horrible to women"" suggest a pervasive negative experience that has led to a broad generalization, which is a common cognitive distortion associated with stress. the desire to be alone rather than engage in relationships further points to a coping mechanism where the individual is trying to avoid additional emotional pain. the questions posed to others about shared experiences and changes in feelings suggest a search for validation and hope, which is typical of someone struggling with stress and seeking reassurance. overall, the narrative exhibits clear signs of emotional turmoil and stress related to interpersonal relationships."
"You can see the detail on my [update 2 right <url> and here's a link to the [project github <url> So I'm begging you here, literally begging you.

"Did I mention my parents are religious? I don't know if this is normal for religious people to treat. Whenever I tell them I'm terrified of being homeless they tell me I'm a ""acting like a baby"" and ""get over it"" my parents parents did not treat them this way. They're basically mad because they(I guess 30 or 40 years ago were different when they were my age? Because they said they both lived on their own at 17 and that they find it creepy I'm 16+ and they find it creepy being around me).",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of distress and anxiety stemming from the individual's interactions with their parents. the person expresses fear of homelessness, which is a substantial stressor, and their parents' dismissive and invalidating responses exacerbate their feelings of insecurity and fear. phrases like ""terrified of being homeless"" and the parents calling them ""acting like a baby"" highlight a lack of emotional support and understanding, contributing to the individual's stress. the comparison to their parents' experiences 30 or 40 years ago, and the negative judgment about the individual's age and living situation, further intensify feelings of inadequacy and pressure. these elements collectively indicate a high level of emotional turmoil and stress, as the individual struggles with fear, lack of support, and harsh judgment from their parents."

"This was a “nice thought”, and even though I had been told my mother to never leave a drink at the bar, it didn’t cross my mind that there might be something put in this drink or that I was being pushed to be more intoxicated. After I started sipping on that drink, I felt all the alcohol hit me and felt drunk. He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber. We pulled up at his apartment complex, and he said come inside I know you’re hungry I have pizza. I thought eating pizza would be a good idea after the alcohol, so I followed him inside.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is recounting an experience at a bar and the subsequent events that followed. the person mentions not considering the potential danger of leaving a drink unattended, and the rapid onset of intoxication suggests a possible tampering with the drink. despite these elements, the tone of the narrative lacks the hallmarks of stress, such as heightened anxiety, pervasive worry, or detailed expressions of fear. the individual recounts the events in a relatively straightforward and matter-of-fact manner, without delving into emotional distress or panic. the decision to follow the person to their apartment is described with a sense of normalcy, indicating a lack of immediate concern or alarm. these aspects suggest that while the situation could have been distressing, the narrative itself does not convey significant indicators of stress."
"But it's been 2 monthsalready this time. We didn't speak for Christmas or new year. I'm lonely, sad, angry at the situation (not angry at him!) and the worst part is not being able to talk or even know what's going on. We didn't fight before this so he's not angry at me.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators typical of stress, such as prolonged periods of silence and lack of communication with a significant person, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and sadness. the mention of not speaking during significant holidays like christmas and new year highlights a disruption in normal social interactions, further contributing to emotional distress. the individual expresses anger at the situation, indicating frustration and helplessness, but clarifies that this anger is not directed at the person involved, suggesting an internal conflict and confusion about the circumstances. the uncertainty and lack of information about the other person's status amplify the stress, as not knowing what is going on can lead to heightened anxiety and a sense of powerlessness. overall, these elements collectively underscore a state of emotional turmoil and stress."
"Sorry this going to be super long, I have a lot to say... Tl;dr... see title. It was constant up and down; one minute we were happy and he was being more affectionate than he has in years, the next he's screaming at me and calling me a whore. I get it, I broke him. I feel so disgusted and ashamed with myself but I truly want to spend my life with no one else.",1,"the narrative reveals a tumultuous and emotionally volatile relationship, characterized by extreme fluctuations in behavior and emotions. the writer describes moments of happiness and affection abruptly followed by intense anger and verbal abuse, which are indicative of an unstable and stressful environment. the use of phrases like ""constant up and down"" and the depiction of being called derogatory names suggest a cycle of emotional abuse that can significantly contribute to stress. the writer's expression of feeling ""disgusted and ashamed"" with themselves further underscores a deep sense of self-blame and emotional turmoil, common in individuals experiencing stress. their desire to stay with their partner despite the negative experiences indicates a complex emotional attachment, often seen in stressful and codependent relationships. overall, the narrative's elements of unpredictability, self-reproach, and emotional conflict are clear indicators of a stressful situation."
"She was seventeen and they met in a hospital, he was in the drug rehab, she was in the mental hospital. She was 17, and he technically kidnapped her, running across the country. She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous. I spent 8 months in an incubator, and had heart surgery, but lived, and have not had health problems.",0,"the narrative details a complex and potentially traumatic family history, yet the tone and manner in which the story is recounted do not exhibit typical indicators of stress. the author presents the events in a factual and straightforward manner, without evident emotional distress or anxiety. despite the mention of serious situations such as premature birth and heart surgery, the narrative lacks expressions of ongoing concern or emotional turmoil. the focus is on recounting past events rather than conveying present feelings of stress. the absence of language reflecting worry, helplessness, or current psychological strain supports the classification."
"And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*. It's getting WORSE though. I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit. She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck... I know they noticed.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual explicitly mentions feeling more anxious and describes the situation as getting progressively worse. the ongoing nature of the issue, lasting about a year, suggests a chronic stress condition. the difficulty in interacting with their mother and the intense anxiety experienced during a family dinner are significant signs. the person's use of strong language and expressions like ""freaking out"" and ""anxious as fuck"" highlight the severity of their emotional distress. additionally, the awareness that others, like their brother, might notice their anxiety indicates a heightened self-consciousness and concern about social perception, which are common in stressed individuals."
"but I'm really, really afraid of public embarrassments and awkward situations. So I was in the train station and saw this homeless lady asking for food and money. I always help homeless people if I have change in my wallet. I walked up to her, took out my wallet and pulled out this £5 cash to give her. She was kinda old, so she wasn't in a perfect physical health.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual encounters a homeless woman at a train station and decides to help her by giving her some money. despite mentioning a fear of public embarrassment and awkward situations, the individual does not exhibit signs of acute stress in this particular scenario. the act of helping the homeless woman is presented in a calm and straightforward manner, without any indication of heightened anxiety or distress. the fear of public embarrassment is acknowledged, but it does not seem to impede the person's ability to act compassionately and decisively in this instance. this suggests that while the individual may have underlying anxieties, they are able to manage these feelings effectively in certain contexts, which is not consistent with someone experiencing significant stress."
"Our dog Jett has been diagnosed with diabetes and is now in the hospital to stabilize his blood sugar. Luckily, he seems to be doing well and he will be home with us soon. Unfortunately, his bill is large enough that we just can't cover it on our own (especially with our poor financial situation). We're being evicted from our home soon and trying to find a place with this bill is just too much for us by ourselves. [To help us with the bill, we set up a GoFundMe <url>",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through multiple indicators. the diagnosis of the family dog with diabetes and the need for hospitalization to stabilize his blood sugar introduces an immediate concern for the pet's health. although there is a momentary relief in knowing the dog is doing well, the financial burden associated with the medical bill exacerbates the situation. the narrative mentions a ""large"" bill that the family cannot cover due to their ""poor financial situation,"" highlighting financial stress. the additional stressor of impending eviction further compounds their anxiety, creating a sense of urgency and helplessness. the need to resort to a gofundme campaign underscores their desperation and lack of resources. these elements collectively illustrate a situation rife with stress, driven by health concerns, financial instability, and housing insecurity."
- Specificphobia: most commom type. It's when something causes exarcebate fear in the person. DSM-5 moved two more disorders to a specific group. But it is anxiety disorders: - TOC and post-traumatic stress.,0,"the narrative provides an objective and factual description of specific phobia and its classification within the dsm-5. it lacks personal elements, emotional language, or subjective experiences that might indicate stress. the focus is on conveying information about types of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (toc) and post-traumatic stress disorder, rather than expressing personal distress or anxiety. the detached and clinical tone, along with the absence of personal pronouns or emotional expressions, suggests a neutral state of mind rather than one influenced by stress. this objective presentation aligns with characteristics typically seen in non-stressed individuals who are able to discuss potentially distressing topics without showing signs of personal emotional involvement."
"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work. And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress.

But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress. the individual mentions missing a day of work because they couldn't handle the stress, which is a clear sign of being overwhelmed. their description of breaks and days off exacerbating stress rather than providing relief suggests a chronic state of tension and an inability to relax. the comparison to how they used to enjoy breaks indicates a change in their mental state, implying that their current stress levels are affecting their ability to enjoy downtime. this shift from past enjoyment to present discomfort during breaks highlights a significant psychological burden. overall, the narrative's focus on the negative impact of stress on their daily life and leisure time is a strong indicator of their current stressed state."

Flip your pillow when its soaking wet and repeat.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation involving extreme heat and its effects on the individual's physical condition, such as dehydration, cramps, and difficulty sleeping. however, the tone and language used suggest a level of resilience and adaptation. phrases like ""i am pretty healthy"" and the mention of having a ""silcock key for water"" indicate a proactive approach to managing the situation. while the conditions described are harsh, the narrative lacks emotional distress or a sense of being overwhelmed, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it reflects a pragmatic attitude towards coping with the environmental challenges, suggesting the individual is managing their circumstances without significant psychological strain."

We've had a toxic relationship, but mostly loving. He truly tried to love me as much as possible, but would get drunk and be verbally abusive.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators, such as the description of a toxic and abusive relationship. the mention of a four-year relationship that was intermittently ""on and off"" suggests instability and emotional turmoil. the recounting of the partner strangling the narrator and being verbally abusive, particularly when intoxicated, highlights exposure to physical and emotional harm, which are substantial stressors. the narrator's conflicting feelings, acknowledging both the partner's efforts to love and the abusive behavior, indicate a complex emotional state often associated with stress. these elements collectively point to an environment of sustained psychological distress."
"Hey everyone. I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore. This evening while playing a boardgame with my BF and some friends, I found out my BF lied big time. Short: last year we decided that I would join him this year on his skiing trip with his friends (his idea). This wasn't possible in the end (or so he told me) because his friends didn't want to rent a cabin but go on a cheap student skiing trip.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and confusion. the author is seeking an outlet to express their feelings, indicating a need for support and clarity. the situation described involves discovering a major lie from their boyfriend, which likely exacerbates feelings of betrayal and uncertainty. the specific incident mentioned—being excluded from a planned trip under false pretenses—highlights a breach of trust. the use of phrases like ""i do not know what to do anymore"" suggests a sense of helplessness and overwhelming emotion. these elements are strong indicators of stress, as they involve interpersonal conflict, a disruption of expectations, and a search for emotional relief."

No one understands me. I give up. On everything.""",1,"the narrative illustrates several indicators of stress. the individual in question exhibits a heightened sensitivity to perceived criticism, as evidenced by becoming extremely offended. this reaction suggests a lowered threshold for emotional responses, often seen in stressed individuals. the silent treatment that follows is a common coping mechanism for those feeling overwhelmed, as it allows them to withdraw and avoid further confrontation. the declaration of not being understood and expressing feelings of giving up on everything are strong verbal cues of emotional distress and hopelessness. these expressions reflect a sense of isolation and despair, both of which are significant markers of stress. the overall tone of the narrative points to an individual struggling to cope with their emotional state, further emphasizing the presence of stress."
"She was already against smoking weed after college at first but now she seems to have moved to a stance where she's okay with me smoking weed as long as she's there when it happens, as in I could smoke with just her or when we're both hanging out with the same friends. I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally, saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her. I don't know how to explain this to her. I don't want to give up the option of smoking weed with friends but I don't want to break up with her over something like this because I love her.",1,"the narrative presents several indicators of stress, both in the writer and the subject of their concern. the writer describes a situation where their partner experiences significant anxiety and distress related to their weed smoking habits. the partner's inability to rationalize her feelings and her near-tearful state when discussing the issue are clear signs of emotional turmoil. the writer also expresses their own stress, caught between their desire to maintain a habit and their love for their partner. the struggle to find a resolution and the fear of potential relationship consequences further highlight the stress experienced by the writer. the narrative is laden with emotional conflict, confusion, and a sense of helplessness, all of which are typical indicators of stress."
"During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms. Overall we’ve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.",0,"the narrative describes significant life challenges, including the traumatic birth of a first child, mental health struggles, and the discovery of a debilitating connective tissue disorder. despite these adversities, the individual highlights the effectiveness of mental health medications in stabilizing symptoms and the presence of a supportive and healthy relationship with strong shared values. the ability to manage symptoms and maintain a positive relationship suggests resilience and effective coping mechanisms, which are crucial for mitigating stress. the narrative's focus on stability and support rather than ongoing distress or overwhelming difficulties indicates a balanced perspective and effective adaptation to life’s challenges."
"I'm worried I have a blood clot or something that gets aggravated when I wear them. I just want to be okay and to have a good time on this trip, but I've been so out of it, and I'm at my wit's end. Right now I'm lying down and I feel blood rushing all through my head, and bulging of blood vessels around my nose. I'm extremely sleep deprived and woozy but I'm scared to go to sleep and am in pain. I'm so scared.",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress. the individual expresses significant worry about a potential health issue, specifically a blood clot, which is a serious concern that can heighten anxiety. the repeated mention of fear and being at their wit's end suggests a high level of emotional distress. physical symptoms such as feeling blood rushing through their head, bulging blood vessels, sleep deprivation, and pain are also described, which can both result from and exacerbate stress. the person's fear of going to sleep due to pain and wooziness further highlights their heightened state of anxiety. overall, the narrative's focus on health anxieties, physical discomfort, and emotional turmoil are strong indicators of stress."
"I have PTSD from my sexual abuse, and this week has been really hard. Really, since Dr. Ford came out against kavanaugh and the fallout of it. Today, though, was really hard. I come home to see my father watching fox news and agreeing that Dr. Ford is a lying whore. His words.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through the individual's explicit mention of ptsd, which is a severe anxiety disorder that arises from traumatic experiences. the specific trigger for the heightened stress is identified as the public discourse surrounding dr. ford's allegations against kavanaugh, which has resurfaced the individual's own traumatic memories. the use of phrases like ""this week has been really hard"" and ""today, though, was really hard"" emphasizes the ongoing and escalating nature of their distress. the encounter with their father, who dismisses dr. ford's allegations with derogatory language, exacerbates the individual's emotional turmoil, as it not only invalidates their own experiences but also creates a hostile and unsupportive environment at home. these elements collectively illustrate the profound impact of external events and interpersonal interactions on the individual's mental health, making it evident that they are experiencing significant stress."
"And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal. I was planning on seeking counselling without my parent's knowledge for this condition once I get to university and get settled, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be told the same thing by a therapist there. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress. the mention of nightmares draining energy and the struggle to feel normal throughout the day are classic symptoms of stress and anxiety. the individual's plan to seek counseling without their parents' knowledge suggests a sense of isolation or fear of judgment, which can exacerbate stress. the uncertainty about what a therapist might say and the desire to connect with others who share similar experiences further indicate a need for validation and support, common in stressed individuals. the apology for seeming ranty or rambling and the acknowledgment of messy thoughts highlight cognitive overload and difficulty in organizing thoughts, both of which are typical under stress. overall, these elements combined paint a clear picture of someone experiencing significant stress."
"i knew gay was humiliation. i tried bringing up to my dad, and he said he wouldn't care if his son was a fudge packer, nor would he care bout that son anymore. i then had to speak to the bishop of my church and tell him about me possibly being gay. my dad was in the back of the room and another man i had never met wa sitting next to him. He asked me if i had ever had any gay encounters.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress, as indicated by several key elements. the individual recounts a deeply personal and distressing experience involving their sexual orientation, which is often a source of internal conflict and anxiety. the use of the term ""humiliation"" suggests a profound sense of shame and emotional pain. the conversation with the father reveals a lack of support and acceptance, as the father’s reaction implies rejection and conditional love, which are potent stressors. the meeting with the bishop, in the presence of unfamiliar individuals, further heightens the stress, as it involves discussing sensitive and private matters in a potentially judgmental environment. these factors collectively point to a high level of psychological distress, characterized by fear of rejection, shame, and the pressure of societal and familial expectations."
"I kept my head up and demanded the respect I deserve. I was very polite and expect the same. She wasn’t, so I put her in her place (she reprimanded me for leaving my gowns hung up in the dressing room). I came back to try on another gown and she goes you could at least bring them back. Mind you I have a one year old in my cart....",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author maintains composure and asserts themselves confidently. despite the conflict with the store employee, the author emphasizes their ability to remain polite and demand respect. they also provide a rationale for their actions, mentioning the responsibility of caring for a one-year-old child, which suggests a practical and composed mindset. the tone of the narrative is assertive rather than anxious or overwhelmed, indicating the author's capacity to handle the situation without experiencing significant stress. the focus on respectful interaction and the absence of language indicating distress or emotional turmoil further supports the conclusion that the individual is not experiencing stress in this scenario."
"I know every time I have panic attacks to remind myself it's just in my head, but it sucks when little things just make you feel like shit! Does anyone else get triggered by stupid things like this? ? I'm even just pissed at myself for now feeling mad at my mom, like don't you know not to tell someone with health anxiety that ""they don't look right""?? Ugh!",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the mention of panic attacks and the effort to remind oneself that it is just in their head highlights ongoing anxiety and the struggle to manage it. the phrase ""little things just make you feel like shit"" suggests heightened sensitivity and a low threshold for stressors, which is common in individuals experiencing stress. the rhetorical question about being triggered by ""stupid things"" indicates a sense of frustration and a search for validation or shared experience, which can be a coping mechanism. the expression of anger towards oneself and the mother reflects internal conflict and difficulty in managing emotions, particularly when faced with comments that exacerbate health anxiety. the use of strong language like ""pissed"" and ""ugh"" underscores the intensity of the emotional response, further supporting the presence of stress."

Maybe I have developed some kind of allergy that is influencing this? > > Any help is appreciated.",0,"the narrative describes physical symptoms such as post-nasal drip, frequent sneezing, headaches, and itchy, watery eyes, which are commonly associated with allergies. the individual is contemplating whether these symptoms might be due to an allergy, indicating a rational approach to understanding their health. the tone is inquisitive and seeks assistance, which suggests they are looking for solutions rather than expressing distress or emotional turmoil. the absence of language indicating significant emotional strain or psychological discomfort aligns with a typical non-stress narrative. overall, the focus on physical health and the logical inquiry into potential causes are not indicative of stress."
"In class, im always on edge, i cant focus on one thing for too long and i constantly scan my environment and I think they think im looking at them which im not. this also made it more awkward to talk to them. I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers. I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet seem more at ease with other people.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly in an academic setting. the individual describes being constantly on edge and unable to focus, which are classic symptoms of anxiety. the mention of scanning the environment and worrying about others' perceptions suggests hypervigilance, a common stress response. the awkwardness in social interactions and the feeling of nervousness around peers and teachers further indicate social anxiety. the perception that teachers and tutors are avoiding interaction due to the individual's visible discomfort suggests a heightened self-awareness and concern about how they are perceived, which can exacerbate stress. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are consistent with experiencing significant stress and anxiety."
"I'm gonna try and get some sleep as it's the middle of the night here, and I hope I get through tomorrow with a single trigger, like I always wish for before I go to sleep.

It's really helped me get through today, and to keep moving forward, no matter how scary it seems, it's still moving forward.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of hope and gratitude, which are not typically associated with stress. the author expresses a wish for a single trigger, indicating an awareness of their challenges but also a belief in improvement over time. the mention of support and kind messages suggests a strong social network and appreciation for external help, which are positive coping mechanisms. the tone is optimistic and forward-looking, focusing on progress and resilience despite acknowledging difficulties. such expressions of hope, gratitude, and support are generally indicative of a non-stressed state, as they demonstrate effective coping strategies and a positive outlook."
"I have a twin sister, Audrey, and I hate her. I genuinely can't explain it. I know it's so irrational, but it's just how it is, and I hate that this is how it is. We both came home for our mom's birthday, and I couldn't even spend 20 minutes with her. We're really different people.",0,"the narrative describes a strained relationship with a twin sister, which could suggest underlying emotional conflict. however, the overall tone and content do not convey acute stress. the individual acknowledges their feelings and the irrationality of their emotions, which indicates a level of self-awareness. there is no mention of physical symptoms of stress, significant life disruptions, or overwhelming emotional responses. the narrative focuses more on a specific interpersonal issue rather than pervasive stress. the context of coming home for a family event and the brief interaction with the sister suggest that the situation, while uncomfortable, is not causing significant distress beyond the described irritation."
"I know this may seem like a small thing, but to someone with these problems, it's a huge deal and to be at a store where you do not feel ""safe"" around your managers and you can't talk with them and grow as an employee, what's the point of continuing to work there? So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company. As I did mention, I have been struggling lately with some things: being slow with completing tasks on the work list is the biggest issue I believe. I'm not sure why I'm slow, in the past a supervisor has said ""Yes you're slow, but you're thorough.""",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly related to the individual's work environment and personal struggles with task completion. the mention of feeling unsafe around managers and the inability to communicate effectively with them highlights a significant source of workplace stress. the decision to switch to a third shift to minimize contact further suggests a coping mechanism to avoid stressors. additionally, the individual's acknowledgment of struggling with task completion and the internal conflict about being slow yet thorough indicates self-doubt and anxiety about job performance. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, as the person is dealing with feelings of inadequacy, fear, and a lack of support in their work setting."
"I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD. (I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate). I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains. I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams. I'm only 18 years old, is it really possible to have a chest angina at this age?",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of stress. the individual discusses consuming a high amount of caffeine and being medicated for adhd with methylphenidate, both of which can contribute to heightened anxiety and physical symptoms like increased heart rate and chest pains. the mention of high blood pressure and chest pains, along with the upcoming cardiologist appointment, further emphasizes the physical manifestations of stress. the concern about having chest angina at a young age also reflects significant anxiety about health. the combination of managing adhd, the side effects of medication, and the stress of upcoming trial exams compounds the overall stress experienced by the individual. these elements collectively illustrate a state of heightened stress and concern about both physical health and academic performance."
"But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself. I do read other people's posts and think maybe I've actually had it easy. Maybe I'm just over exaggerating thing, but i feel like I need to get it off my chest. Anyway thanks for reading. ( sorry the post is so long ).",1,"the narrative indicates a person experiencing stress through several key aspects. firstly, the mention of someone suffering from depression and having ""enough on her plate"" suggests a heavy emotional burden. this is a common indicator of stress as it implies the individual feels overwhelmed. secondly, the narrator compares their situation to others, reflecting a sense of self-doubt and minimization of their own struggles, which are typical signs of stress. the phrase ""maybe i am just over exaggerating"" suggests they are questioning the validity of their feelings, a behavior often seen in stressed individuals who may feel their concerns are not justified. the need to ""get it off my chest"" is a direct expression of the desire to relieve emotional tension, a clear indicator of stress. finally, the apology for the length of the post hints at a fear of being a burden, another stress-related concern. all these elements combined paint a picture of someone grappling with internal stress and seeking validation or relief through sharing their narrative."
"I'm 24 and have massive amounts of stress going on with job hunting. I live with parents who are constantly on my back and getting angry with me for not having a job. They keep trying to help me by saying ""oh this place is hiring and that place is hiring again."" I have tried all places where I live and every time I don't get an interview let alone hired. Even if they have a sign up that they are hiring, they tell me ""sorry we're not hiring right now.""",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through several indicators. the author mentions ""massive amounts of stress"" explicitly tied to job hunting, which is a common stressor for many individuals, especially young adults. the pressure from living with parents who are ""constantly on my back"" and ""getting angry"" adds to the emotional burden, indicating a strained home environment. the repeated efforts to find a job and facing continuous rejection despite signs that suggest otherwise contribute to feelings of frustration and helplessness. this cycle of effort and rejection can erode self-esteem and increase stress levels. the parents' well-intentioned but persistent suggestions may feel overwhelming and unhelpful, exacerbating the author's stress. these elements collectively illustrate a scenario where the individual is experiencing considerable stress due to external pressures and repeated setbacks."
"When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply traumatic experience from childhood that continues to have a significant impact on the individual's mental health. the person mentions experiencing panic attacks and crying when unexpectedly confronted with reminders of the trauma, indicating ongoing emotional distress. the use of strong language and expressions of frustration, such as ""ruined me mentally"" and ""i hate that my trauma is so bad,"" further underscore the severity of their condition. the fact that a seemingly innocuous activity, like reading a thread about a favorite hobby, can trigger such a strong emotional response highlights the pervasive and intrusive nature of their stress. the overall tone conveys exhaustion and a sense of being overwhelmed, which are common indicators of chronic stress and trauma."
I don’t know. Was this okay? Should I hate him? Or was it just something new? I really don’t know what to make of the situation.,1,"the narrative reflects significant uncertainty and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the repeated use of phrases like ""i dont know"" and ""should i"" highlights a state of indecision and doubt, suggesting the individual is struggling to process their emotions and thoughts. this indecisiveness can be a manifestation of stress, as it often hampers one's ability to think clearly and make decisions. additionally, the questions about whether to hate someone or view the situation as something new indicate a conflict in feelings, further contributing to the stress. the overall tone conveys a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to find clarity, which are typical signs of an individual experiencing stress."
Any tips for making more friends? Tl;dr: I've had very few friends throughout my life. Recently I've tried reaching out to a lot of people but almost all of them will decline my offer to hang out at some point. I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard. Any tips for making more friends?,1,"the narrative reflects a sense of social isolation and difficulty in forming connections, which are common indicators of stress. the individual mentions having very few friends throughout their life and experiencing repeated rejections when attempting to socialize. this pattern of social rejection can contribute to feelings of loneliness and inadequacy, exacerbating stress levels. the mention of being socially awkward and the perception of trying too hard suggest a lack of confidence and self-esteem issues, both of which are often associated with stress. the repeated questioning and seeking advice for making friends further highlights the individual's preoccupation with their social difficulties, indicating an ongoing concern and potential source of stress. overall, the narrative displays several elements that align with typical stress indicators, such as social withdrawal, low self-esteem, and persistent worry about social interactions."

"I think now she feels some of responsibility to help those in need and she gets a lot of gratification from these people who are very thankful to her. On occasion when we go out, we have been approached by these people and I can tell they are very grateful to her. We were at Starbucks while she's studying and the husband/wife she helped offered to buy her coffee, etc ... Lastly, her other dream is to get a house in this very rich neighborhood with houses that cost $2M at the very least. Anyways, enough with the bad, now the good things about her. She is a very loving person which is proven by the fact that everyone loves her at work.",0,"the narrative describes a person who finds joy and fulfillment in helping others, as evidenced by the gratitude they receive from those they assist. specific examples include being approached by thankful individuals and receiving gestures of appreciation, such as being offered coffee. additionally, the narrative mentions aspirations and dreams, such as wanting to buy a house in a wealthy neighborhood, which indicates goal-setting and future planning rather than immediate distress. the mention of the person's loving nature and popularity at work further supports a positive and supportive social environment. these elements suggest a sense of purpose, social support, and overall well-being, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I looked regular for once and it’s been a while to feel that way. I wanted to show who I was today to the world, it was empowering seeing that face I used to be especially when I saw him just a month ago. I left right away to catch any train heading to North Hollywood and eventually arrived at the area of my work interview. I was early but I know I made a mistake without considering how hard it is to panhandle especially when you don’t look it for the part. I had a sign with me and I asked people to spare me a quarter at most but all I got were weird looks.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of empowerment and self-recognition, as the individual expresses satisfaction with their appearance and a desire to present themselves confidently to the world. despite encountering challenges, such as panhandling and receiving strange looks, the tone remains relatively composed and self-aware. the person's focus on their actions, like catching the train and arriving early for an interview, suggests a level of organization and forward planning. these elements indicate a balanced perspective and the ability to manage daily tasks without significant emotional distress. the mention of a mistake is acknowledged without overwhelming negativity, pointing to a capacity for self-reflection and adaptation rather than being overwhelmed by stress."
"Hello guys. This is my first post here. Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different. Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable. My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators typical of stress. the individual mentions an inability to fall asleep that started a few months ago, which is a common symptom of stress-related sleep disturbances. the anxiety experienced at night and before heading to bed further highlights a pattern of anticipatory anxiety, often seen in stressed individuals. the physical symptoms described, such as the body heating up, sweating, and a pounding heart, are classic physiological responses to anxiety and stress. these somatic complaints contribute to the overall discomfort and are clear markers of stress. the variability in daily experiences, with each day being different, also suggests an unstable emotional state, which is another sign of stress. the narrative's focus on these distressing experiences and the physical and emotional toll they take supports the classification of the individual as experiencing stress."
I'm completely devastated. My cat was just hit and killed by a car. I don't think I'm allowed to bury him in the garden (we rent) and I don't know what to do. I've searched online and found loads of pet cremation services but they all cost a fortune. I don't have a penny to my name as I'm unemployed.,1,"the narrative clearly reflects significant emotional distress. the individual expresses devastation over the loss of their cat, which is a major emotional event. the use of words like ""completely devastated"" indicates a profound sense of grief. the practical concerns about not being able to bury the cat in the garden and the financial stress of not affording pet cremation services further compound their distress. the mention of unemployment adds another layer of stress, highlighting financial instability and lack of resources. these elements together are typical indicators of someone experiencing high levels of stress due to both emotional loss and financial hardship."
"Any help on how to stop ruminating? I work with some pretty toxic people and I can accept when people are ignorant and generally rude about my PTSD. I get it, some people are just really stupid and ignorant and won't understand how the assault affected me. But I spend WEEKS ruminating on all the things they've said, things they might say next... and the grounding techniques that my therapist suggests never stops it. How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly chronic stress related to trauma and interpersonal conflict. the individual describes working in a toxic environment, which can be a significant source of ongoing stress. the mention of ptsd highlights a history of trauma that exacerbates their stress levels. ruminating on negative interactions and anticipating future conflicts are classic symptoms of stress and anxiety. the ineffectiveness of grounding techniques suggested by their therapist suggests that their stress levels might be quite high, making it difficult to manage intrusive thoughts. overall, the narrative is filled with signs of distress, including the struggle to find effective coping mechanisms, which are all typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."
"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over. Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed. She spent a lot of time talking about suicide. During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author describes feeling frozen and waiting for events to pass, which suggests a sense of helplessness and inability to cope with the situation. the mention of petitioning someone to stop and that person's visible distress indicates an ongoing, possibly distressing interaction that could contribute to the author's stress. the discussion of suicide is a significant red flag, as it introduces a severe emotional and psychological burden. exchanging letters that felt like love letters but attributing them to a best friend love shows confusion and a struggle to understand complex emotions, especially given the author's young age and lack of romantic experience. these elements collectively point to a high-stress environment where the author is dealing with emotional turmoil, confusion, and a sense of powerlessness."
Is there anyway I could persuade you to go a view you love (if not any place is fine) and write something similar on a card or piece of paper [I attached an example here].

I aim to continue trying until I can get at least 100.,0,"the narrative suggests a goal-oriented and organized individual who is planning a specific task and is reaching out for help in a calm and structured manner. the language used is polite and appreciative, indicating a positive and hopeful outlook. phrases like ""thank you all if you consider helping"" and ""it means the world"" reflect gratitude and a sense of community support. the intention to post again and continue trying until reaching a goal of 100 shows persistence and determination without signs of distress or urgency. overall, the tone is composed and focused on achieving a goal through collaborative effort, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"After college for about 2 years, I focused on my career and wasn't totally putting myself out there. Now, for the last year, I've actively put myself in the dating pool. It never seemed appealing to hang around in clubs or bars to hopefully pick someone up, so I've mostly stuck to online dating. I was mostly pretty casually looking, and would go on there when the mood struck me or I was speaking to someone I saw potential with. Over the course of the last about 2.5 months, I've been on 3 dates.",0,"the narrative describes a period of transition and self-reflection after college, focusing on career development and eventually exploring the dating scene. the individual mentions a deliberate and casual approach to dating, opting for online platforms over social settings like clubs or bars. the tone is reflective and composed, without indications of distress or urgency. the mention of going on dates when the mood strikes suggests a relaxed attitude towards the process. the individual does not express frustration or anxiety about the dating experience, nor do they mention any overwhelming challenges or pressures. the overall narrative conveys a sense of calm and measured engagement with their personal life, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I got 6 stitches. My parents love my bf and in fact, my mom and him are so close that they go on walks and go to the movies together. I felt uncomfortable and unwanted by his family. To be fair, I was also a little closed off with them but mainly because I felt so unwanted. I have put on some weight, which I am sure his dad noticed because he absolutely hates fat people.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the mention of getting 6 stitches suggests a recent injury, which can be a physical stressor. the relationship dynamics described indicate emotional distress; the writer feels uncomfortable and unwanted by their boyfriend's family, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and low self-worth. the fact that the writer's mother is close to the boyfriend might exacerbate feelings of inadequacy or jealousy. additionally, the writer's self-consciousness about weight gain and the belief that the boyfriend's father has a negative view of overweight people can further contribute to stress and anxiety. these elements collectively highlight significant emotional and social stressors impacting the individual."
I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things. When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.,1,"the narrative indicates several signs typical of an individual experiencing stress. the person describes a noticeable decline in their ability to manage tasks and responsibilities over time, starting from a period when they were highly capable and proactive. the transition from being ""very bright"" and taking charge to becoming ""lazier"" and struggling significantly in college suggests a shift that is often associated with chronic stress or anxiety. the mention of difficulty with even the simplest tasks points to a potential loss of motivation and increased mental burden, both common symptoms of stress. additionally, the self-diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder reflects an awareness of persistent anxiety, which can exacerbate stress levels. the overall tone of the narrative conveys a sense of frustration and helplessness, further supporting the presence of stress."
"This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat. I understand she was just trying to protect her son, but the level of nastiness was just insane. I had to get our old counsellor - mine and N's - involved to speak to her. She said the mother is taking things seriously. I don't believe it.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, starting with the phrase ""extreme anxiety spiral,"" which directly points to a heightened state of emotional distress. the individual describes a longstanding relationship with the mother, indicating a significant investment of time and emotional energy, which can amplify the impact of sudden negative actions. the mention of the mother's ""nastiness"" and the need to involve a counsellor highlights the severity of the conflict and the individual's struggle to manage the situation. the disbelief in the mother's intentions adds to the sense of mistrust and ongoing tension. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress due to unresolved interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil."

It's been incredibly hard making ends meet by myself and although I get rent paid, all other bills are stuck on the back burner. Our electric bill is over $400 and they're demanding $225 as a minimum payment. It's scheduled for disconnect today and I can't put it off any longer. I know it's a long shot but seriously needing a miracle at the moment.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the overwhelming responsibilities and financial pressures described. the individual is a single parent to four children, a situation that inherently involves high levels of daily stress and demands. the removal of the children's father due to substantial abuse adds a layer of emotional and psychological strain. financial difficulties are evident, with the individual struggling to manage essential bills despite having rent covered. the specific mention of a high electric bill and the imminent threat of disconnection amplifies the sense of urgency and desperation. the plea for a miracle underscores the individual's feeling of being overwhelmed and the lack of available resources or support. these elements collectively illustrate a state of acute stress, characterized by financial hardship, single parenthood, and the aftermath of dealing with an abusive relationship."
"I was never really close to him, our conversations never went past the 'nice weather we're having' area. But I coincidentally ran into him at a bar recently and I initially tried to keep my distance from him because I know he's friends with Zach, but then he told me that not only does he and Zach are no longer in contact with each other, they actually really dislike each other now. I'm guessing something went down after Zach and I broke up. After that, I was more comfortable around him. So, as the night went along and we got drunker, we ended up hooking up.",0,"the narrative reflects a casual and somewhat positive encounter where the author navigates a social situation with someone they were not previously close to. the initial discomfort due to a shared connection with an ex is resolved when they learn that the two are no longer in contact, which alleviates any potential tension. the progression of the night from keeping distance to becoming more comfortable and eventually hooking up indicates a relaxed and spontaneous decision-making process. there is no mention of ongoing anxiety, overwhelming emotions, or significant distress that would typically be associated with stress. the author's tone remains neutral and descriptive, focusing on the sequence of events rather than expressing any deep-seated concerns or stress-related symptoms."

[Team Thomas](gf.me/u/jyy4qm)",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a friend of the husband who is facing a difficult period, but the tone and structure suggest a sense of support and community rather than personal stress. phrases like ""created by a friend"" and ""team thomas"" indicate a collective effort to help, which can mitigate feelings of isolation and stress. the call for assistance, ""if anyone can help. please do,"" while urgent, is framed in a way that seeks external support rather than expressing internal turmoil. the focus is on the practical aspects of organizing help rather than detailing personal emotional struggles, which aligns more with a proactive and solution-oriented mindset rather than one overwhelmed by stress."
"We are 100% no contact, and have decided we won't talk to each other for at least a few months, or until we're ready to talk and maybe try to be friends. He says he still cares deeply for me and loves me, but this is for the best. I wish it was easier to get over, but it isn't. What advice do y'all have? Thanks!",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author and another individual have mutually agreed to cease contact for a few months with the intention of potentially rekindling a friendship in the future. despite acknowledging the emotional difficulty of the situation, the author conveys a sense of acceptance and understanding that this decision is for the best. the narrative lacks overt signs of acute stress, such as overwhelming anxiety, pervasive hopelessness, or a sense of being unable to cope. instead, it reflects a rational approach to a challenging circumstance, a recognition of mutual care, and an openness to seeking advice, which suggests resilience and an ability to manage the emotional impact of the situation."
"I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of persistent anxiety and worry about potential negative outcomes. the individual's concerns about losing their job and their girlfriend leaving them for someone perceived as better reflect a deep-seated fear of inadequacy and self-worth issues. the constant preoccupation with these worries and their impact on self-esteem suggests a pervasive sense of insecurity. this is further evidenced by the stress experienced in everyday interactions, such as going to the store, which should typically be mundane activities but are described as extremely stressful. the mention of having ""a million thoughts a second"" and constantly second-guessing oneself highlights the overwhelming nature of their anxiety, which is a classic symptom of stress. these aspects collectively point to a state of heightened stress and anxiety, affecting multiple facets of the individual's life."

I am currently still at home with my parents.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is dealing with long-term depression but does not show immediate signs of acute stress. they mention having bought a house, which suggests some level of stability and planning for the future. while they acknowledge their depression, they also note that they appear normal in interactions, indicating they have some coping mechanisms in place. the individual is living with their parents, which could provide a support system, further reducing the likelihood of stress. their request for advice shows a proactive approach to their situation, which is not typical of someone under significant stress who might feel more helpless or overwhelmed. overall, the elements in the narrative point to someone managing their mental health challenges without the additional burden of acute stress."
"(Hurt the ego, but whatever, I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of insecurity and emotional turmoil stemming from a past relationship. the writer's ego is significantly hurt by the comparison with his ex-girlfriend's high school boyfriend, highlighting feelings of inadequacy and jealousy. the discovery of the e-mail exacerbates these feelings, leading to self-doubt and a reevaluation of the relationship's dynamics. the emphasis on physical attributes and career success as points of insecurity suggests a struggle with self-worth and identity. the writer's conclusion that his ex-girlfriend's lack of attraction was due to a comparison with past boyfriends rather than other factors further underscores a pervasive sense of inadequacy. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as they involve ruminative thoughts, negative self-comparison, and emotional distress related to past experiences and personal insecurities."
"There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators typical of stress. the individual mentions a sudden onset of anxiety, which is a common symptom of stress. the relationship issues and health anxiety mentioned are significant stressors. googling symptoms and subsequently experiencing physical symptoms are behaviors and experiences often associated with heightened anxiety and stress. the expression of seeking relatability and the detailed recounting of personal struggles further emphasize the stress the individual is experiencing. overall, the narrative is characterized by elements that align with stress-related experiences."
"The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands.

That never happened.""",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through the description of dissociation and depression, which are both psychological responses often associated with trauma and high levels of stress. the mention of an abusive relationship is a critical indicator, as it frequently leads to chronic stress and mental health issues. the specific examples of gaslighting and rewriting history further underscore the psychological manipulation and emotional abuse, contributing to the narrator's stress. phrases like ""you're just remembering wrong"" and ""you have bad memory"" are classic tactics used by abusers to undermine the victim's sense of reality, leading to increased confusion, self-doubt, and stress. the narrator's apology for the ""jumbled mess"" of the post suggests a lack of clarity and organization in their thoughts, which can be a direct consequence of ongoing stress and mental strain. overall, the elements of dissociation, depression, and the described abusive behavior are strong indicators of a high-stress environment impacting the individual's mental health."
"But there you were, laughing and being affectionate with your newest victim. Same dark hair, same bubbly personality. She's a prettier, skinnier version of me.

"Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.",0,"the narrative highlights the struggles of trauma survivors and the psychological impacts of their experiences, such as anxiety, depression, and toxic shame. it emphasizes the need for safety and security over awareness and describes the deep-seated feelings of inadequacy and abandonment that survivors often face. while the content is heavy and acknowledges significant emotional and psychological challenges, it is presented in an analytical and informative manner rather than a personal, emotionally charged one. the detached tone and general discussion of trauma-related issues suggest an objective perspective, which is typical of an educational or supportive context rather than an expression of current personal stress."

Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself.

Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have.

God I just want this to be over with.",1,"the narrative clearly illustrates several key indicators of stress. the individual expresses feeling overwhelmed by the college application process, which is a significant source of stress for many high school seniors. the mention of not having finished the college list, not starting essays or supplemental materials, and not filing the fafsa points to a sense of being unprepared and falling behind, which can heighten anxiety and stress levels. the added pressure of an early action (ea) deadline exacerbates these feelings, as it creates a more immediate time constraint. additionally, the lack of college visits and perceived inadequacy of extracurricular activities (ecs) contribute to the stress, as these are important components of a strong college application. the final statement, ""god i just want this to be over with,"" is a clear indication of the desire to escape the current stressful situation, further highlighting the individual's emotional burden. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress experienced by the individual."

"An old friend invited me over to a small party she was having. You could say it was more of a get together, there were no more than 15 people at a time. It was only people I remember from years ago in MS and HS, or people I have met several times. The night was full of a series of moments that I will be kicking myself in the head for later-- starting with the fact that I introduced myself to someone with ""I haven't seen you in a while!"" and they said ""Oh really?",0,"the narrative describes a social gathering with familiar faces from the past, which generally suggests a comfortable and nostalgic environment. the author's recounting of the event does not reveal significant signs of stress. although there is a mention of a slightly awkward moment when reintroducing themselves to someone, this is framed more as a minor social faux pas rather than a source of substantial anxiety. the overall tone remains light-hearted and reflective rather than overwhelmed or distressed. the context of reconnecting with old acquaintances in a familiar setting is more likely to evoke feelings of warmth and reminiscence rather than stress."

I want him in my life so badly, as a friend that is. We had a wonderful connection that’s hard to come by (at least for me) and I hate to lose that.",1,"the narrative reveals a situation where the author is experiencing significant emotional turmoil. the loss of a close and meaningful connection is a potent source of stress, especially when it involves a complex relationship dynamic like a friends-with-benefits arrangement. the ultimatum given by the friend has created a sense of pressure and forced the author into a difficult decision, which is a classic stress-inducing scenario. the author's repeated expressions of heartbreak and longing for the lost connection underscore their emotional distress. phrases like ""breaking my heart"" and ""i want him in my life so badly"" are strong indicators of the emotional pain and stress the author is going through. the mention of a ""wonderful connection"" that is ""hard to come by"" highlights the value placed on the relationship, intensifying the sense of loss and stress. this narrative is rich with emotional cues that align with common stress responses, such as sadness, longing, and the difficulty of coping with an unwanted change."

Like, for one example *""...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)...

If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear. But at least he didn’t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and traumatic situation, which includes elements of fear, threat, and aggression. the author recounts a moment of immediate danger where they had to protect their child from potential harm, indicating a high-stress environment. the presence of verbal abuse, with vivid descriptions such as seeing veins bulging and being called names, further emphasizes the emotional and psychological strain. the act of covering the children's ears to shield them from the abuse highlights a protective instinct amidst chaos, which is often a response to severe stress. the repeated threats of physical violence, specifically being told they would be stabbed in the throat, underscore a persistent state of fear and anxiety. these elements collectively suggest an environment fraught with intense stress and danger, significantly impacting the individual's mental state."

"When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'. There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head). Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving two siblings engaging in rough play, which resulted in an injury. the writer notes a sense of unease about the explanation given for the injury, suggesting it seemed rehearsed. despite these observations, the narrative lacks explicit signs of stress. the focus is more on curiosity and skepticism about the unusual behavior of the siblings rather than on feelings of anxiety, pressure, or distress. there is no mention of the narrator experiencing symptoms such as difficulty sleeping, overwhelming emotions, or physical manifestations of stress. the tone remains inquisitive and somewhat detached, without delving into personal emotional responses that are typically indicative of stress."
"Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep. Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle. Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through the description of generalized anxiety disorder (gad) exacerbated by lack of sleep. the vicious cycle of anxiety and insomnia is a common stress indicator, highlighting how one issue perpetuates the other. starting a new fulltime job with considerable responsibility has triggered underlying fears, another hallmark of stress. the mention of prescribed medication, particularly xanax (alprazolam), and the fear of potential withdrawal or addiction further emphasizes the individual's heightened anxiety and stress. the cautious approach to medication, taking it only after reaching a breaking point, underscores the severity of the stress experienced. these elements collectively point to a narrative steeped in stress and anxiety."

"I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1,"the narrative describes an individual experiencing significant difficulty sleeping due to heightened anxiety. the mention of chest and stomach tightening is a physical manifestation of stress, which is a common symptom. the individual is fixated on thoughts about an event involving pippa that occurred 6-7 years ago, indicating rumination, a psychological pattern often linked with stress and anxiety. the use of strong language such as ""insane"" to describe their level of anxiety suggests a sense of being overwhelmed. additionally, the person’s attempt to seek support from their family, only to face disagreement, likely exacerbates their stress by making them feel isolated and misunderstood. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, as the narrative includes both physical symptoms and cognitive patterns typically associated with significant anxiety."

While in college, I suffered from a concussion and mold poisoning from my dorm room.",0,"the narrative describes several significant life events and challenges, such as being independent from a young age, experiencing financial difficulties, and dealing with health issues like a concussion and mold poisoning. however, the tone of the narrative is relatively calm and matter-of-fact. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, anxiety, or an inability to cope, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, the author provides a straightforward recount of their experiences without delving into emotional turmoil or expressing feelings of helplessness or distress. this suggests that, despite the difficulties faced, the individual is managing to cope and does not exhibit the heightened emotional responses often associated with stress."

"I felt the tension and the seriousness. Usually during lockdown drills things aren't too serious because we're high schoolers. We mess around because we know nothing is wrong. But this drill was different. We knew we were all okay, that everyone was safe, but the atmosphere was completely different.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the atmosphere during a lockdown drill was unusually tense and serious compared to previous experiences. however, the author acknowledges that everyone knew they were safe and that nothing was actually wrong. this suggests an awareness of the difference in the environment without an underlying sense of personal distress or ongoing anxiety. the description of the high schoolers typically messing around indicates a generally relaxed attitude towards such drills, reinforcing the notion that the tension felt was situational and temporary rather than indicative of sustained stress. the author's ability to distinguish between the seriousness of the drill and their own sense of safety points to a balanced and non-stressed state of mind."

Will I be considered mentally ill forever?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep internal conflict and contemplation about mental health, which is often a significant indicator of stress. the author questions their past decisions and expresses regret about not seeking help earlier, a common sign of rumination that can contribute to stress. the strong aversion to the term ""mentally ill"" suggests a struggle with self-acceptance and societal stigma, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. the admission of having ptsd indicates a recognition of trauma, which inherently involves high stress levels. the uncertainty about the future and concern over being labeled as mentally ill forever further highlight ongoing anxiety and stress about their identity and mental health status. these elements collectively point to a narrative marked by stress and inner turmoil."
"Even moreso with a little push from behind. I've also been interviewing and applying for more secondary jobs to supplement my current employment and that seems to be going increasingly well. Thank you so much again everyone who sent food items to me, I'll be sure to pay it forward someday!

I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, it’s not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.",0,"the narrative reflects a generally positive and supportive relationship, highlighting traits such as kindness, love, and selflessness. the mention of rare fights and successful conflict resolution suggests a stable and healthy dynamic. the hurt feelings over a specific incident appear to be an isolated event rather than a pattern of ongoing distress. the writer's contemplation of moving forward with an apology indicates a willingness to resolve the issue and maintain the relationship's positive aspects. the context of the incident involving alcohol consumption on vacation suggests it was an unusual situation rather than a regular source of stress. overall, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of chronic stress, such as pervasive negative emotions, ongoing conflict, or feelings of helplessness."
"I would like to leave there, but I'm terrified of a shelter. I'm also a semi observant Jewish woman. Most shelters won't help me keep kosher and keep Shabbat, both of which are important to me.

The NCJW shelter in the area doesn't accept the voucher welfare would offer me.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, primarily stemming from the individual's housing instability and the associated fear of shelters. the mention of being ""terrified of a shelter"" highlights an acute anxiety about the immediate living situation. the individual's adherence to religious practices, such as keeping kosher and shabbat, adds another layer of complexity and stress, as most shelters do not accommodate these needs. this creates a sense of helplessness and limited options, exacerbating the stress. additionally, the rejection from specific shelters like the rachel coalition and the ncjw shelter due to various reasons further compounds the feelings of isolation and desperation. the overall tone of the narrative, marked by a combination of fear, religious obligation, and limited resources, is indicative of a high-stress situation."

I’ve always been the type of person who’s been gravitated towards romance.

"Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like ""Ugh, *finally*"". Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares. Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life.

No one knows I have these fears.,0,"the narrative describes a person who has developed effective coping mechanisms to manage their anxiety and fears, particularly in social or work-related situations. by setting personal boundaries and giving themselves permission to leave events or meetings if necessary, they have maintained a sense of control over their environment. this proactive approach has allowed them to participate in work meetings peacefully for many years. the individual also mentions that no one is aware of their fears, indicating that their strategies have been successful in managing their stress to the point where it does not interfere with their daily functioning or become apparent to others. overall, the narrative reflects a well-adjusted individual who has learned to navigate their anxiety in a way that minimizes its impact on their life."
Things were so good again. Just like the beginning. Then the yelling comes back. I got really sick and had to go to the hospital and he refused to come and visit me when I was home. He told me I was dense for expecting him to come hang out with me when I have such a deadly disease (it was MRSA and not that deadly).,0,"the narrative describes a situation that initially appears positive but quickly devolves into conflict and disappointment. despite the presence of stressful events, such as being yelled at and dealing with a serious illness like mrsa, the individual's tone seems more resigned than distressed. they recount the events in a matter-of-fact manner without expressing intense emotions or catastrophic thinking, which are typical indicators of high stress. the mention of the partner's refusal to visit and the derogatory comment about the illness might suggest relational issues, but the lack of emotional intensity in the narrative suggests that the author may not be experiencing significant stress. instead, they seem to be recounting past events with a degree of detachment."
"[Here is the link to her <url> ***Do not read below this if you have a weak stomach*** My friend has a very sweet toy poodle mix that was recently attacked. A much larger dog attacked Paige's (my friends dog) face and ripped off her lower jaw, to the point it was hanging down by just the remaining skin and fur that was attached. Paige went into a 24hr vet and had emergency surgery that allowed the jaw to be re-attached but the middle of the jaw (from canine tooth to canine tooth) had to be completely removed so Paige essentially has a large hole in her lower jaw now.",0,"the narrative describes a traumatic event involving a friend's pet, which could be emotionally distressing. however, the author's tone remains factual and descriptive, focusing on the sequence of events and medical procedures rather than expressing personal anxiety or emotional turmoil. there is an absence of language indicating overwhelming worry, helplessness, or panic that would typically characterize a stressed individual. the narrative's structured recounting of the incident and the medical response suggests a level of composure and detachment, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I'm posting this one more time for anyone that didn't see it. Our location is in central Louisiana. A co-worker recently gave birth last week and her baby is in stable condition. She was initially told that her baby would have dwarfism and she was okay with that, as long as it was healthy. Later, they told her that her baby wouldn't survive at birth.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a co-worker who recently gave birth. despite initial concerns about the baby's health, specifically the possibility of dwarfism, the baby is now in stable condition. the narrative conveys a sense of relief and acceptance from the co-worker, indicating that she was prepared for the challenges associated with her baby's condition. the absence of immediate, overwhelming emotional distress or anxiety in the description suggests that the author is not currently experiencing significant stress. the focus is on sharing information rather than expressing personal turmoil or heightened emotional responses. the tone remains factual and composed, which are indicators that the author is managing the situation without undue stress."
"I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.",0,"the narrative describes a person's struggle with various mental health issues, including anger, alcohol abuse, depression, and difficulties concentrating at work. these issues were initially attributed to bipolar disorder, leading to numerous medication trials and even electro-convulsive therapy, all of which proved ineffective. the turning point came when the individual decided to try therapy, despite initial reluctance and a strong aversion to discussing trauma. while the narrative details significant challenges and a complex mental health history, it also reflects a proactive approach to managing these issues and an openness to exploring new treatment avenues. the willingness to engage in therapy, despite previous reservations, suggests a level of self-awareness and a commitment to personal growth, which can be seen as positive indicators of resilience rather than ongoing stress."
"I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't. But I am in trauma therapy for the last four months, and my therapist has brought it up a number of times. She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, which are evident through the writer's struggle with substance use and the ongoing therapy for trauma. the mention of quitting drinking and the detailed timeline suggests a considerable effort to make life changes, which can be inherently stressful. the internal conflict about continuing to use grass, despite the therapist's concerns, highlights a common stressor of balancing mental health needs and coping mechanisms. the therapist's repeated emphasis on the negative impacts of grass on motivation and depression underscores a tension between professional advice and personal coping strategies. additionally, the writer's acknowledgment of generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and social anxiety further indicates an ongoing battle with mental health issues, which are classic indicators of stress. the narrative encapsulates the complexity of managing multiple mental health challenges and the stress that accompanies making significant lifestyle changes while in therapy."
"I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on. I’ve talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry, it hasn’t made me feel better. This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life. I can’t predict how long this is going to go on and I’m sick of the weak, dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it. I’ve been trying to replace bad thoughts with good, I’ve tried CBT techniques, I’ve tried wallowing in the bad thoughts (as advised by someone over at r/emetophobia)... nothing has worked, I’m a mess.",1,"the narrative describes an individual grappling with intense emotional distress and an ongoing struggle with ptsd. the person has sought help by talking to a counsellor but feels that it hasn't provided relief, highlighting a sense of helplessness and frustration. the mention of trying various coping strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) techniques and advice from an online community, indicates active efforts to manage their condition, yet none have been successful. the feelings of being overwhelmed, unpredictability of the episode's duration, and physical sensations of weakness and dissolution are strong indicators of acute stress. the narrative's tone conveys a deep sense of desperation and a lack of control over their mental state, which are classic symptoms associated with high levels of stress and trauma."
"So what I am asking is someone or somebody's to help me with the rest of the repair cost. The repair is 575 dollars, I have about 200 of that currently, I need to get this done soon before I am stuck on the side of the road with a broken down vehicle and spending unnecessary money on Ubers or Lyft. I'm willing to pay back monthly with acceptable interest until it's paid in full. I get paid bi-weekly at my full time job. Thanks in advance!",0,"the narrative describes a practical and organized approach to solving a financial problem related to car repairs. the individual outlines the specific amount needed, what they currently have, and the urgency due to potential increased costs from alternative transportation methods. they also propose a clear repayment plan, indicating financial responsibility and forward planning. this structured and solution-focused mindset, along with the absence of emotional language or expressions of overwhelming anxiety, suggests that the individual is managing their situation without significant stress. their ability to calmly communicate needs and propose a feasible solution is indicative of a non-stressed state."
"Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest. This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year. He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell. After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back. He treated me like a dog.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply traumatic experience involving prolonged abuse in multiple forms: sexual, physical, and emotional. the recounting of such intense and distressing events is a clear indicator of the writer experiencing significant stress. the mention of being trapped and the ongoing impact of the abuser trying to reestablish contact, even after the victim has managed to break free, highlights the lingering effects of trauma. phrases like ""sick, twisted human being"" and ""treated me like a dog"" reflect intense emotional pain and dehumanization, which are common in individuals who have undergone severe abuse. the narrative's tone and content provide substantial evidence of ongoing psychological distress, typical of someone who has endured such severe violations and is still grappling with their aftermath."
"But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.",1,"the narrative describes a series of anxiety-provoking situations where the individual experiences intense panic related to the need to use the bathroom. the onset of panic during travel, whether in a car, on a train, or considering a bus ride, indicates a pattern of anticipatory anxiety. the person’s reaction to take valium, a medication used to manage anxiety, and the subsequent embarrassment in front of friends, highlights the severity of their distress. the narrative also shows avoidance behavior, such as getting off the train one stop early and being unable to board the bus, which are common coping mechanisms for those dealing with significant anxiety. the individual’s frustration and acknowledgment that this fear is starting to control their life further illustrate the impact of stress on their daily functioning. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and anxiety influencing the person's behavior and emotional state."
"Hey guys, I'm not homeless myself, I'm just after some advice. Basically, I work in a restaurant that closes late so I'm often not back to my apartment complex until around midnight. For the last few nights when I come back, I've noticed a homeless person sleeping between the glass front at the ground floor entrance and the back of the stairwell... This doesn't particularly bother me because I figured he's just sleeping and all the individual apartments have locks on the doors anyway. However I could understand if others in my complex would be distressed or anxious by this, especially if they live on the first floor (I'm fortunate to live higher up on the fourth floor).",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is seeking advice about a homeless person sleeping in their apartment complex's entrance. the tone is calm and composed, and the person explains that they are not personally bothered by the homeless person's presence. they express understanding and empathy for potential concerns of other residents, particularly those living on the first floor. the individual’s focus is on practical aspects and the safety measures in place, such as the locked apartment doors. there is no indication of personal distress or anxiety, suggesting a rational and collected approach to the situation. this level-headed and empathetic perspective is typical of someone not experiencing significant stress."
"But 19 and 39? to me I feel like that is someone older than my current age dating an age that seems like a child to me.... I creeped her facebook and she appears to be a "" normal"" 23 year old...going out partying...saying things I would have found funny at that age but cringe at now.....and he did share with me that he supported her for the most part and so on...I asked if she had any "" life skills"" and his answer was "" not really"". What are people's thoughts on this? ---",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is engaging in social comparison and reflecting on age differences in relationships. the author is contemplating the appropriateness of a relationship between individuals of significantly different ages, which may indicate curiosity or concern rather than stress. the use of phrases like ""to me i feel like"" and ""i creeped her facebook"" suggests a casual exploration of social norms rather than a distressed state of mind. the author’s reflections on their own past behavior and their current perspective further illustrate a process of normal self-reflection and comparison. the inquiry about ""life skills"" and seeking others' opinions indicates a desire for social validation or understanding rather than an expression of personal stress. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, emotional intensity, or signs of personal distress that are typical indicators of stress."
"I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe. I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking. But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me. I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise. Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual expresses difficulty with basic daily activities, such as getting out of bed and checking their phone, which are common symptoms of stress and anxiety. the mention of panic upon checking their phone suggests heightened anxiety and a sense of overwhelming pressure. the contradiction of constantly checking the phone while disliking the noise indicates an ongoing internal conflict and a heightened state of alertness, both of which are stress indicators. the pressure of a job that requires constant availability, combined with the inability to manage personal well-being, highlights a significant source of stress. the narrative's tone and content reflect a struggle with maintaining control and coping with responsibilities, which are typical signs of someone experiencing high levels of stress."
"She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him.""",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual is assisted in going to the bathroom and later reveals that her husband grabbed her by the neck and hurt her, expressing fear about returning to him. while the content of the narrative is undoubtedly distressing and indicative of a potentially abusive relationship, the lack of personal emotional expression from the narrator and the focus on recounting events rather than internal emotional states suggest a more detached recounting. the narrative does not provide insight into the narrator's own stress levels or emotional reactions, which are crucial indicators of personal stress. the description is factual and lacks the subjective distress or emotional turmoil typically associated with a stressed individual."
12. End of January I just didn't have any way to get enough money and we collapse with an eviction process started. 13. Working with friends and others we managed to get the money right after the judgement was issues for eviction. This stopped the eviction but we still had a judgement.,1,"the narrative describes a series of events that are typical indicators of stress, such as financial instability and the threat of eviction. the mention of having no way to get enough money and the initiation of an eviction process suggests a high level of anxiety and pressure. the urgency and desperation to gather funds with the help of friends and others further emphasize the stressful nature of the situation. even though they managed to stop the eviction, the presence of a judgment still hanging over them implies ongoing stress and unresolved issues. these elements collectively point to significant emotional and psychological strain, which are clear signs of stress."
"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1,"the narrative describes a clear onset of distress following a panic attack in october, which led to persistent anxiety, particularly about the individual's heart health. the mention of specific blood pressure readings (140/90 and 120/70) reflects a preoccupation with physical symptoms, a common manifestation of anxiety. despite medication with zoloft providing some initial relief, the return of severe anxiety symptoms such as fear of death, a lump in the neck, and chest stiffness indicates ongoing psychological turmoil. the individual's concern about medication dependency and side effects further exacerbates their stress. the detailed recounting of physical symptoms and medical evaluations underscores the depth of their anxiety, making these elements typical indicators of stress."
"This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress. the individual expresses frustration and disappointment with the lack of reciprocity in their physical relationship, which has become one-sided. this sense of imbalance and unmet needs is a common stressor in intimate relationships. the mention of trouble with sexual performance due to insufficient physical stimulation further highlights the impact of this issue on their mental and emotional well-being. the duration of the relationship and the fact that the individual had hoped for improvement over time but saw no change adds to the sense of ongoing stress and dissatisfaction. the decision to communicate their concerns, only to find their partner content with the status quo, likely exacerbates feelings of helplessness and stress. these elements collectively point to a state of emotional strain and distress."
I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0,"the narrative describes a sequence of events where the individual seeks assistance from an advisor to understand certain procedures. the tone of the narrative is calm and matter-of-fact, with no mention of overwhelming emotions or physiological symptoms typically associated with stress, such as anxiety, tension, or panic. the individual recounts their actions in a straightforward manner, indicating they took proactive steps to resolve their confusion by consulting their advisor. the brief mention of expecting a fellow student to react does not suggest significant stress, as it is presented as a passing thought rather than a source of intense worry or fear. overall, the narrative reflects a composed and rational approach to problem-solving, which aligns with a non-stressed state."
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1,"the narrative indicates significant stress through various elements. the description of ""freaking out"" and ""hyperventilating"" are clear physiological responses often associated with acute stress or panic attacks. standing on the back porch for an extended period while trying to regain control suggests a struggle with managing overwhelming emotions. the self-criticism and feelings of embarrassment highlight a negative self-assessment and potential social anxiety, which are common in stressed individuals. the anticipation of future embarrassment indicates ongoing worry and rumination, further emphasizing the presence of stress. these elements collectively point to a high level of psychological distress."
"I dial. 000. I have never used that number before. How does this wor…. “Emergency: Police, Fire or Ambulance?”",0,"the narrative describes an individual dialing an emergency number for the first time and encountering the options for police, fire, or ambulance. the tone of the narrative is neutral and factual, focusing on the mechanics of the situation rather than expressing any emotional distress. there are no explicit indicators of stress such as anxiety, panic, or overwhelming concern. the person's thoughts seem organized and calm, as they are simply recounting the process of using the emergency number. the lack of emotional language and the straightforward description suggest that the individual is not experiencing significant stress in this moment."
"Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne, rubbing its pitchfork, planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress and psychological distress. the author expresses a pervasive sense of hopelessness and self-deprecation, highlighted by phrases like ""wasting my life"" and ""lonely fuck who pushes away everyone."" the repetition of ""doing nothing"" underscores a feeling of stagnation and lack of purpose, which is often associated with depressive symptoms. the comparison to others who ""party like there is no tomorrow"" and ""make memories"" suggests feelings of inadequacy and social isolation. the use of harsh language and explicit imagery conveys deep-seated frustration and anger towards oneself. the mention of mental disorders and the metaphor of the brain planning to ""fuck me"" indicates a severe internal struggle, possibly hinting at intrusive thoughts or a negative self-dialogue. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant stress and emotional turmoil."
"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection. He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the recounting of past trauma and ongoing psychological effects. the individual describes an inability to sleep due to intrusive thoughts about their husband, highlighting persistent anxiety. the mention of feeling alone in their situation and the confusion about the nature of the abuse indicates a deep emotional struggle and a lack of validation. the description of ""wrestle and tickle torture"" despite pleas to stop shows a violation of personal boundaries and a lack of control, common stressors that can lead to feelings of helplessness and fear. the ongoing physical reaction of being ""flinchy"" even after no longer living with the husband suggests lingering trauma and hypervigilance, which are classic signs of post-traumatic stress. the resentment towards the husband for making the individual feel ""small and fearful"" and the internal conflict of feeling ""crazy"" or overreacting further underscore the psychological turmoil and stress experienced."
"People may quickly think ""drugs"" but just try and quickly think ""animals"" unless you are dangerous when you have your episodes or become angry after them. Just think that all of that drug money some people spend could go on raising and giving a loving home to an animal who will heal him/her. x &#x200B; &#x200B;",0,"the narrative suggests a perspective shift from thinking about drugs to thinking about animals, implying a desire for positive change and a focus on nurturing and healing. there is an absence of personal distress or turmoil; instead, the author appears to be offering advice for betterment. the mention of using drug money for raising animals indicates a constructive mindset, aimed at finding solutions and promoting well-being. the tone is advisory rather than confessional or desperate, lacking typical indicators of stress such as expressions of anxiety, overwhelm, or personal struggle. the narrative's emphasis on healing and providing love to animals suggests a stable and positive outlook, rather than one clouded by stress."
"When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1,"the narrative describes behaviors and feelings that are indicative of significant stress and anxiety. the individual mentions standing behind the door and waiting for quiet before stepping out, which suggests avoidance behavior and a heightened state of alertness, common in anxiety disorders. the loud music played by a housemate exacerbates their stress, leading them to isolate further by using headphones and sleeping to escape the noise. the anxiety and depression experienced are severe enough to impact their academic performance, highlighting the pervasive effect of their mental state. seeking help for anxiety for the first time indicates that the individual recognizes the severity of their condition and is taking steps to address it, which underscores the depth of their struggle. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone dealing with significant stress and anxiety."
"What if in Ireland a place existed where pollution was zero, crime didn't exist and you where given access to food, warm beds and a chance to rebuild your life. Would you take it?

Self sustainable life with access to counselling and all food and board paid for help?",0,"the narrative reflects a contemplative and hopeful outlook, which are not typical indicators of stress. the individual expresses dissatisfaction with city life but does so in a constructive manner, exploring positive alternatives such as rural living and self-sustainability. the tone is solution-oriented, focusing on practical steps to achieve a better quality of life. the consideration of a homeless scholarship program and access to counseling suggests a forward-thinking and proactive mindset. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, anxiety, or helplessness, which are common signs of stress. instead, the narrative is characterized by thoughtful planning and a desire for improvement, indicating a state of reflection rather than distress."
"One anxiety free day. I feel like I could live off that high for the rest of my life. Not starting my day off trying to catch my breath. Not having to plan out every single minute of my day as to avoid discomfort, or even panic. Not standing in the middle of a locker room getting ready to cry because you saw a lock on the locker you use every time you're at the gym.",0,"the narrative describes a sense of relief and freedom from anxiety, emphasizing the contrast between a stress-free day and the usual experience of stress. the author highlights specific examples such as not starting the day with difficulty breathing, not meticulously planning to avoid discomfort, and not feeling overwhelmed by minor triggers like seeing a lock on a locker. these reflections suggest an appreciation for the absence of stress rather than an active experience of it. the focus on the positive aspects of a stress-free day and the detailed recounting of usual stressors indicate a moment of clarity and relief, rather than ongoing distress. this perspective is typical of someone who is reflecting on past stress rather than currently experiencing it, showcasing an understanding of their own stress triggers and a momentary escape from them."
"I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next. I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed. I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter how old they are. You always have to be around people for one reason or another. I'm just never comfortable around people anymore.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of anxiety and discomfort associated with social interactions. the individual expresses fear about potential future actions, words, and questions from others, which is a common indicator of stress. the desire to isolate oneself and the preference for solitary activities, such as spending time with a computer, keyboard, guitar, and bed, further underscores a coping mechanism often employed by those experiencing stress. the acknowledgment of being a teen and feeling trapped by circumstances beyond control highlights a sense of helplessness, another stress marker. the statement about never being comfortable around people anymore indicates a shift from previous social comfort to current social anxiety, reinforcing the presence of stress. these elements collectively point to an underlying struggle with stress and social anxiety."
"For no reason, I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings. Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack. I don't understand why and it can last for a long time. Anyways. Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.",1,"the narrative describes waking up with anxiety-like feelings, including physical symptoms such as stomach ache and a sense of uneasiness. the mention of dread and the fear of having a panic attack indicate a heightened state of arousal and worry. the lack of understanding of the cause of these feelings adds to the sense of helplessness, which is a common experience among individuals under stress. the duration of these symptoms and their persistence over time further suggest a chronic stress condition. although breathing exercises provide some relief, the fact that they do not fully alleviate the symptoms highlights the severity of the stress. these aspects—physical symptoms, emotional distress, persistent worry, and partial relief from coping mechanisms—are typical indicators of stress."
"All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.",1,"the narrative exhibits multiple indicators of stress. the author expresses an overwhelming feeling of being unable to escape the pervasive discussions and accusations of sexual abuse, which is causing significant emotional distress. the mention of victim blaming and the frustration with the lack of understanding about consent among many men highlights a sense of societal disillusionment and helplessness. the fact that the author hasn't left their apartment in days suggests social withdrawal, a common response to high stress levels. the reliance on weed for self-medication, despite its expense, indicates a struggle to find effective coping mechanisms. additionally, the author notes that being autistic exacerbates their stress, leading to overstimulation and a need to hide, further emphasizing their acute emotional and sensory overload. the overall tone of the narrative, combined with these specific examples, clearly reflects a state of significant stress."
"Not like triggers per say, because I'd have to ask her about that, but more general behaviors. Like, if I see her acting in a certain way that is common to abuse victims, I should know to be careful around that. Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior. Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that). So any additional information is useful.",0,"the narrative demonstrates a thoughtful and analytical approach to understanding another person's behavior, particularly in the context of past abuse. the author is focused on being observant and considerate, aiming to support the individual without causing further distress. the calm and measured tone, as well as the emphasis on gathering information and being careful, suggests a methodical and empathetic mindset rather than one characterized by stress. the mention of not trying to correct the person and providing reassurance indicates a stable and composed demeanor, which are not typical indicators of stress."
$400 would suffice but $500 will drastically help boost my income for 4/4. Time frame for repayment listed includes $100 tip and is at-worst scenario. In other words loan may be repaid sooner.

I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly. I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like “yeah I can do it” I feel beyond tense. Anyone been in a similar spot? What did you end up doing? Thanks!,1,"the narrative indicates a significant level of stress, primarily due to the recurring pressure from non-work individuals to fly, which the author finds challenging. the mention of trying to psych themselves up suggests an ongoing internal struggle and a desire to overcome the fear or anxiety associated with flying. however, the fleeting confidence followed by intense tension highlights the persistent nature of their stress. seeking advice from others in similar situations further underscores their need for support and validation, a common behavior in individuals dealing with stress. the use of phrases like ""beyond tense"" and the overall tone of frustration and helplessness are typical indicators of stress, reflecting both emotional and psychological distress."

I go way down the rabbithole, sometimes, wondering if I am crazy and nothing happened and my ex was right, because there are so many things I can't remember, now.",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress. the author mentions experiencing significant internal conflict and fear, both common signs of stress. the fear of remembering a specific year and the guilt associated with not remembering it indicate a troubled past that is causing ongoing psychological distress. the use of words like ""scared,"" ""frightened,"" and ""guilty"" reflect intense emotional turmoil. additionally, the author’s contemplation of their sanity and the doubt about their own memories further suggest a state of mental strain. these elements combined point to a narrative characterized by stress and anxiety, with the individual's thoughts and emotions being heavily impacted by their past experiences."
"If I pursue this research, would you be interested in participating? How much time would you be willing to give (asking because a survey might take up to 30minutes, but an interview can take up to 2 hours)? Would you prefer to be surveyed or interviewed (it would likely be a phone interview)? If I did a survey, it would probably still include some open-ended questions (that you are free to leave a few sentences of a few page worth of a response to) so I can still hear directly from you. Feel free to answer these questions in the comments, or dm me.",0,"the narrative presents a calm and methodical approach to seeking participation in research. the writer's tone is neutral and composed, indicating a clear and organized thought process. they provide options for participation, show flexibility, and respect the potential participants' time and preferences. the questions posed are straightforward and practical, focusing on logistics rather than expressing any personal concerns or emotional distress. the absence of any language indicating urgency, frustration, or anxiety suggests a state of non-stress. the writer's ability to maintain a structured and considerate communication further supports this interpretation."
"I made way to the store, it was full of like the whole fucking town. Turns out it was like this nearly every night, feeling good I decided to make conversation with the guy at the register. I was curious as to what happened to that other convenience store. Considering there was only two in the whole area, both in good spots, you wouldn’t think it would just go out of business. Nah something was off.",0,"the narrative describes a trip to a store that is crowded with people, indicating a bustling environment. despite the busy setting, the author mentions feeling good and decides to engage in conversation with the cashier, showing a willingness to socialize and a positive mood. the curiosity about the other convenience store closing suggests a normal level of inquisitiveness rather than anxiety or worry. the language used, while casual and slightly expletive, does not convey signs of distress or emotional turmoil. overall, the narrative reflects a typical, everyday experience without notable indicators of stress such as overwhelming anxiety, negative self-talk, or expressions of helplessness."
"She resents my relationship with our son - My son is a Daddy's boy. Even now as I type this I hear him out there waiting for me saying Daddy Daddy Daddy. He comes and gives me hugs when I come home and barely notices when my wife is gone or comes home. - ‎This is also something she's recently admitted and I feel guilty about it, but I feel like it's because she puts in no effort beyond what she needs to do.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress, primarily stemming from family dynamics and feelings of guilt. the writer describes a strained relationship with their partner, noting the resentment she feels toward the bond between father and son. this tension is exacerbated by the son's overt preference for his father, which is evident when he eagerly calls for ""daddy"" and shows little acknowledgment of his mother's presence. the writer's guilt is palpable, particularly when they mention their wife's recent admission of feeling unappreciated. the writer attributes this to her perceived lack of effort, hinting at underlying marital discord. these elements—resentment, guilt, and perceived inadequacies—are strong indicators of stress, as they reflect unresolved emotional conflicts and strained interpersonal relationships within the family unit."
"As I'm sitting there patiently, I can hear the receptionist and her friend chatting about all sorts of things, fixing their hair, laughing. Finally I called my fiancé to tell him what was going on - I think I've been ""forgotten"" (the waiting room is off to the side out of view of the reception area). I was feeling very anxious to confront her and ask if she had forgotten about me because I did not want to get in a scuttle as I remember her temper from my last visit. As my fiance is on the phone helping me build up the courage to talk to her, the doctor walks out to the reception area visible to me, coat on, laptop in hand, ready to call it a night. I see him point to me and ask his wife what I'm waiting on.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing a degree of anxiety and frustration while waiting for an appointment. however, the overall tone and context suggest that this is a temporary and situational response rather than a chronic or overwhelming stress condition. the person recounts specific details about the receptionist's behavior and their own reluctance to confront her due to a previous negative interaction, which indicates a normal reaction to an uncomfortable situation. the narrative also includes a moment of relief when the doctor intervenes, suggesting that the individual's anxiety was situational and resolved once the uncertainty was addressed. such reactions are common in everyday life and do not necessarily indicate a prolonged state of stress."
"Neither one at all my fault but thanks for thinking it is. :) I have plenty of value regardless of my relationship status or if something shitty has befallen me or not. tl;dr We broke up.

Maybe next time he'll think about what he wants and is willing to do before he opens his mouth.",0,"the narrative displays a sense of resolution and acceptance, which are not typical indicators of stress. the individual acknowledges the breakup and expresses confidence in their self-worth, regardless of their relationship status. the tone is assertive and self-assured, suggesting a level of emotional stability. phrases like ""plenty of value"" and ""maybe next time he'll think about what he wants"" indicate a reflective and forward-looking mindset rather than one preoccupied with anxiety or distress. the use of humor in ""thanks for thinking it is. :)"" further supports the interpretation that the person is coping well and not experiencing significant stress. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional turmoil, uncertainty, and pervasive negative thinking often associated with stress."
I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice. He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat. An example would be at Darvin furniture one time. He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk. I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,1,"the narrative reveals a sense of powerlessness and lack of autonomy, which are common indicators of stress. the author describes feeling forced to submit to another person's will, indicating a dynamic of control and dominance that can be highly stressful. the favoritism shown towards the sister, coupled with the example of the unequal treatment at darvin furniture, highlights feelings of inadequacy and neglect. these experiences can contribute to a sense of worthlessness and frustration, exacerbating stress levels. the emotional impact of these interactions is evident, as the author expresses a clear disparity in treatment that likely contributes to ongoing emotional distress."

But since it worked so well i ignored it.",0,"the narrative describes a long-term user of paxil who is considering switching medications. the individual acknowledges the effectiveness of paxil in managing their condition but expresses concerns about significant weight gain and decreased energy levels over the years. despite these side effects, the person has continued with the medication due to its benefits. the tone of the narrative is reflective and practical, focusing on weighing the pros and cons of the medication rather than expressing acute distress or anxiety. this balanced perspective and the absence of immediate, intense emotional language are typical indicators of a non-stress state. the individual’s ability to calmly discuss their situation and consider alternatives without exhibiting signs of panic or overwhelming worry further supports this assessment."
I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process. I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more. I keep blaming myself and beating myself up.

I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body, threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.",1,"the narrative describes a highly volatile and dangerous environment characterized by frequent physical altercations and threats of self-harm. specific examples such as having objects like vases, game controllers, and coffee mugs thrown at the individual indicate episodes of acute conflict and aggression. the mention of being physically blocked from leaving and facing threats of suicide further amplifies the sense of entrapment and helplessness. these elements are strong indicators of a high-stress situation, as they suggest ongoing psychological and possibly physical abuse, contributing to a heightened state of anxiety and fear. the repetitive nature of these encounters and the severe reactions described are consistent with symptoms commonly associated with chronic stress and trauma."

I still cant.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of stress, as evidenced by the individual's feelings of being overwhelmed and struggling to adjust to a new environment. the mention of giving up independence and the difficulty in accepting help, after having been self-reliant for a long time, indicates a major shift in their lifestyle that is causing emotional strain. the specific example of needing supplies and being directed to ask someone else for help highlights a sense of helplessness and loss of control, which are common indicators of stress. the repeated expression of confusion and inability to comprehend the situation further underscores the mental and emotional burden the individual is experiencing. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress, as the individual navigates through significant changes and challenges in their life."
"The room would be free, along with internet access and a bed provided until you got on your feet. Once you are stable, we would, of course, expect you to chip in a bit. We have gigabit internet in the house, several flat screens, central air, and access to pretty much every streaming service you could want, as well as a shared steam library of about 1400 games.

I've lived alone in various apartments for a few years now, and I don't ever let people come over. I'm pretty messy, but not anything extreme enough to justify keeping people away. My boyfriend has only been over a handful of times and I do my best to rush him out. I'll go out of my way to keep people out.",0,"the narrative indicates a person who experiences situational anxiety specifically related to their living space, but this anxiety does not appear to permeate other areas of their life. the individual explicitly states they are not generally anxious, which suggests that their stress is limited to a specific context. while they exhibit behaviors such as keeping people away from their home and rushing their boyfriend out, these actions seem more related to personal preferences and comfort levels rather than pervasive stress. the mention of being messy but not extremely so also implies that the individual is aware of their habits and chooses to manage their space in a way that suits them, rather than out of a sense of overwhelming stress. overall, the narrative reflects a person with a specific concern about their living environment rather than someone experiencing generalized stress."
"I am 25 years old, suffered from anxiety for about 10 years or so. Anxiety used to stop me from being able to leave the house unless with my parents or boyfriend.

They were too caught up in their anger. My grandmother would tell me stories about having to be the one that cleaned the blood from the walls.

My mother left my father when I was two.,0,"the narrative recounts past traumatic experiences, but it is delivered in a detached and matter-of-fact manner, indicating a level of emotional distance from the events described. the mention of the grandmother cleaning blood and the mother leaving the father are described without emotional inflection or present distress. the narrator's recollection of their brother and their own silence during the incidents suggests a coping mechanism rather than current stress. the tone is reflective rather than overwhelmed, implying that the individual has processed these memories and is not presently experiencing significant stress related to them. the focus on past events, without expressing ongoing emotional turmoil or anxiety, supports the classification."
"Most of 2017, I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months, I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work, moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author discusses significant weight gain over a short period due to life changes such as traveling for work, moving to a new city, and the holidays, which are common stressors. there is a clear expression of body dissatisfaction and envy towards slimmer individuals, which suggests a negative self-image. the obsessive thoughts about appearance and the inability to maintain a positive outlook, especially when drinking, further highlight the emotional turmoil. the relationship dynamics with the boyfriend add another layer of stress; despite his affirmations of love and beauty, his past actions of breaking up over weight issues and labeling the author as an excuse maker contribute to the feelings of insecurity and unhappiness. the combination of these factors—body image issues, obsessive thinking, emotional breakdowns, and complicated relationship dynamics—are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."
He admitted to using the social media of girls he knows to get off. He even admitted to using his ex's nudes to get off. He downloads that specific app and then usually deletes it. He forgot today. We have sex 1-3 times a day.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual discusses their partner's troubling behavior, such as using social media accounts and explicit images of others for sexual gratification. this kind of disclosure often signifies emotional turmoil and distress, as the behavior described is likely to cause feelings of betrayal, insecurity, and inadequacy. the mention of frequent sexual activity might be an attempt to compensate for or manage these feelings, but it also suggests a potential imbalance or pressure in the relationship. the partner's actions and the individual's reaction to them are typical stressors that can significantly impact mental health, leading to heightened anxiety, tension, and emotional strain."
"In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight, he's a weight lifter, and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people . If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me. I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY? I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past. Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators. the writer expresses fear and anxiety about their partner's violent behavior, mentioning instances of blind rage and physical altercations. the mention of the partner's weight and strength compared to the writer's body weight emphasizes a power imbalance that contributes to the writer's sense of vulnerability. the use of phrases like ""permanently damage me"" and ""chokings are happening during every incident"" highlights the severity and frequency of the abusive episodes, which is a clear source of ongoing stress. the writer's background in healthcare adds another layer of distress, as they are aware of the potential long-term consequences of such violence. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of stress, including fear for personal safety, anxiety about the future, and the psychological burden of living in an abusive environment."
"German Shepards, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and Poodles all seem like a good choice. Poodle would be good for allergies as many of my close family have allergies.

I'm just a prop.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is consistently subjected to humiliation and belittlement, both in private and public settings. this constant degradation can lead to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem, which are common indicators of stress. the person's role as a mere ""servant"" and ""prop"" highlights a lack of agency and respect, exacerbating feelings of powerlessness and frustration. the mention of being the ""butt of jokes"" and being used to boost someone else's social standing further emphasizes a dynamic of exploitation and emotional abuse. such experiences can significantly impact mental health, leading to chronic stress and anxiety."
"Asked for a little extension. She won’t provide it. I should be able to graduate in December.

We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering we’re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so we’re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else that’s cheaper. My brother leaves in 2 days because he has to go back to college and we need to take action when he’s here because me and my mom can’t really go against my dad (physically).,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual expresses fear and anxiety about their safety, mentioning the need for a restraining order due to concerns about continued harassment even after the person in question goes to jail. financial instability adds another layer of stress, as they anticipate having to move to a cheaper living situation, which can be a significant source of worry and uncertainty. the urgency of the situation is heightened by the brother's imminent departure for college, leaving the individual and their mother feeling vulnerable and unsupported. the combination of safety concerns, financial pressure, and the lack of physical protection against a potentially threatening family member are all strong indicators of a highly stressful situation."
"We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower. And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked. We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day. This made him even more mad.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes a situation where their partner is monitoring their data usage, which implies a controlling dynamic. the partner's comments about feeling like a father and wishing for more responsibility in the individual can be perceived as belittling and critical, likely contributing to feelings of inadequacy and tension. the individual's response of staying silent and letting it slide suggests a possible avoidance of confrontation, which can be a stress response. additionally, the partner's escalating anger when faced with the park's closure further adds to the stressful atmosphere. these elements collectively highlight a context of relational strain and emotional discomfort, typical indicators of stress."
"I am the person you go to to get stuff done, or if you want the right advice. I run marathons, kill it at the gym, learn languages and study for degrees in my spare time.

"and how that would intersect with a potential partner’s attitude. You’ve probably seen the posts on here: a woman gave birth four months ago and her husband is pissed off because her breasts are sore and he can’t play with them. A woman gave birth three months ago and her husband is pressuring her for PiV sex even though she is still uncomfortable. A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones. These were posts I remember reading on here for some relevant examples, but I can go on.",0,"the narrative reflects observations about the dynamics between partners post-childbirth, focusing on issues related to physical intimacy and differing expectations. while the examples given describe situations that could be stressful for the women involved, the tone of the narrative itself is analytical and detached. the writer is recounting scenarios they have read about rather than expressing personal distress. the discussion is more about societal patterns and the behavior of partners rather than a personal, emotional response. this objective recounting, without a personal emotional stake, indicates that the writer is not experiencing stress themselves but is instead providing commentary on the subject."
Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma. Starting out the session was definitely very strange. I wasn’t sure what answers my therapist was looking for but once she assured me that there were no wrong answers everything went fine.,0,"the narrative describes a therapy session that appears to be progressing in a structured and positive manner. the individual mentions setting up a safe space the previous week, which suggests proactive steps toward managing potential stress. the person acknowledges the initial strangeness of the session but highlights a turning point where reassurance from the therapist led to a smoother experience. this indicates an openness to the therapeutic process and a level of comfort with the support being provided. the absence of language expressing significant distress or overwhelming emotions suggests that the individual is coping well with the situation. overall, the narrative reflects a constructive engagement in therapy rather than a state of stress."
"I'm leaning more toward not responding but I haven't been able to let it go. I'm not sure what she even wanted, other than to talk to me before make a big decision for and her kids. I got a message pleading for a conversation, no explanation as to what. She apologized and stated that she wasn't trying to cause problems. She said he was in prison for something that happened a long time ago (looks like he was on felony probation and did something to get it revoked), sent pictures of her children, who are all one year older than the children him and I share, and told me his mother had passed.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving complex emotions and interpersonal dynamics, but the tone and content suggest a level of detachment and contemplation rather than acute stress. the author reflects on their decision-making process and provides a detailed account of the events without exhibiting signs of overwhelming anxiety or distress. the focus on factual information, such as the other person's apology, the status of the individual in prison, and the mention of the children and a deceased mother, indicates a rational processing of the situation. the absence of intense emotional language or expressions of feeling overwhelmed supports the conclusion that the author is managing the situation with a relatively calm and measured approach, typical of someone not currently experiencing significant stress."
"Things between us were amicable until that point. Now, the atmosphere is VERY different. It hurts now because she's acting indifferent and like she's totally unaffected (which she might well be, I don't know if she's pretending). Shes already moved on to someone else, someone she's liked for a while, her boss. She has tried three times to bring her up and talk to me about her.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the writer is dealing with a significant change in a personal relationship. despite the emotional pain and confusion expressed, the language used does not suggest overwhelming stress. the writer acknowledges the change in atmosphere and the hurt caused by the other person's indifference, but there is no mention of symptoms typically associated with stress, such as anxiety, sleeplessness, or an inability to cope. the writer's tone remains relatively calm and observational, indicating an ability to process and articulate their feelings without being consumed by them. the reference to the other person's new relationship and attempts to discuss it suggest that the writer is still engaging in social interactions and managing the situation with a level of emotional detachment, which are not typical indicators of high stress levels."

You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.",1,"the narrative describes a significant traumatic experience involving an involuntary psychiatric hold, which the individual perceives as unjust and covered up by the therapists involved. this incident has had a lasting impact on the person, who expresses feelings of betrayal and mistrust. the mention of their girlfriend having ptsd and suggesting that they might have it too indicates a heightened awareness of psychological distress and trauma. the detailed recounting of the event, coupled with the emotional weight of betrayal and the poor conditions of the hospital, are strong indicators of ongoing stress. these elements collectively point to a narrative deeply rooted in unresolved trauma and psychological strain."
"I have never before felt so betrayed by the system. Fiance (f) was blackout drunk. She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes. All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time). As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and traumatic event where the individual recounts experiencing physical violence from their partner. specific examples such as being grabbed by the genitals, sustaining a tear in the scrotum, and being punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked are clear indicators of severe physical and emotional stress. the feelings of betrayal by the system and the inability to escape the situation while being nude further amplify the sense of vulnerability and helplessness. the need to call 911 highlights the acute danger and fear for personal safety, which are strong markers of a highly stressful experience. these elements collectively indicate a significant level of distress and trauma."
"I'm sure as other survivors many of you are overcoming some of the same problems as well, and may have already had some of these realizations (of what makes you YOU) or are in search of them on your journey to becoming whole. It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald! In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about ""undermining her"".)",0,"the narrative reflects a journey of self-discovery and healing, with the author acknowledging the deep emotional scars and wounds they have experienced. the mention of crying harder during a session than when waking up in a hospital bald suggests a significant emotional release, which is a common part of the healing process rather than an indication of current stress. the reference to post-partum depression and living with difficult family dynamics in the past highlights past struggles, but the author expresses gratitude for positive changes, such as the improved parenting of their father after his divorce. this gratitude and recognition of personal growth and positive changes in relationships suggest resilience and a focus on recovery, which are not typical indicators of current stress. the narrative overall indicates a reflective and healing mindset rather than one dominated by present stress."
I even pressed chargers against him. Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it. Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him. I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still. I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of emotional turmoil and ongoing distress, which are clear indicators of stress. the author mentions pressing charges against someone, suggesting a serious and traumatic event. the fact that the individual still finds ways to impact the author's life through others indicates a continued source of stress and emotional manipulation. the mention of struggling with daily flashbacks is a classic symptom of post-traumatic stress, highlighting the persistent and intrusive nature of the trauma. the author's acknowledgment that they do not expect the distress to fully go away further underscores the depth of their emotional struggle. however, there is also a glimmer of resilience and hope as they mention moving far away and having survived the ordeal, which shows an awareness of their own strength despite the ongoing stress."
#NAME?,0,"the narrative does not show typical indicators of stress. it lacks expressions of overwhelming emotions, negative self-talk, or descriptions of physical symptoms such as headaches or fatigue. instead, the tone seems calm and composed, with a logical flow of thoughts and a focus on positive or neutral experiences. the individual appears to have a sense of control over their circumstances and does not mention feelings of helplessness or being overwhelmed. this stability in their narrative suggests they are not currently experiencing significant stress."
I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now. I am at a high risk for homelessness. Landlord now wants me out unless I can come up with $800 in the next couple of days. I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, evident through the author's reluctance to seek help and feelings of shame. these emotions are common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress, as they may feel vulnerable or fear judgment. the mention of being at high risk for homelessness and the urgent need to come up with $800 within a short timeframe adds to the sense of immediate pressure and anxiety. additionally, the recent loss of food stamps without a clear reason exacerbates the author's stress, as it threatens their basic needs and stability. the combination of financial instability, housing insecurity, and difficulty accessing essential resources are clear stressors that can significantly impact mental well-being."
"As much of an asshole I know it makes me, I simply can't put my heart into a relationship in which I know I'm not the father of her child. I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with, and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep internal conflict and emotional turmoil. the author expresses guilt and self-judgment by acknowledging their feelings of being an ""asshole"" for not being able to commit to a relationship where they are not the biological father of the child. the mention of being ghosted by someone they deeply cared for indicates a significant emotional wound, leading to a period of seeking physical relationships as a means to cope with the pain. this behavior suggests attempts at distraction and avoidance, common responses to stress and emotional distress. the juxtaposition of the author's acknowledgment of the woman's genuine care and ambitious plans for their future with their own inability to reciprocate those feelings further highlights the inner struggle and stress. the thought of having to eventually break her heart and the impact it has on the author underscores the depth of their emotional conflict and the psychological burden they are carrying. overall, the narrative is laden with indicators of stress, including guilt, avoidance, internal conflict, and emotional pain."
"When I was 16 I met a guy on vacation 11 years my senior... Having never been able to get along with those in my age group, I thought nothing of somebody older spending time with me, as I had grown up always spending my time around the adults during the holidays or my older brother's friends... Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies... He played nice for my vacation-- respecting my boundaries and acting only as a friend. He showed me the island and was nothing but kind and hospitable to my family...",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of retrospective clarity and understanding of past events. the individual recounts a youthful experience with a significantly older person, acknowledging the innocence and naivety that characterized their younger self. the tone is reflective and analytical rather than emotionally charged or distressed. the narrator expresses a logical and composed perspective on the situation, recognizing the inappropriate nature of the older man's intentions without exhibiting signs of ongoing emotional turmoil or stress. the narrative focuses on the recounting of events and the lessons learned, indicating a resolved and thoughtful state of mind. there is no evidence of current anxiety, fear, or unresolved emotions that would typically be present in a stressed individual. instead, the narrator appears to have processed and accepted the past, demonstrating a healthy coping mechanism and emotional resilience."

I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

Should I apologize? **TL;DR** **BF thinks being called a lady jokingly is an insult and emasculating, I disagree, what do ? **",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is questioning their actions and seeking clarity on a social interaction with their boyfriend. the tone suggests confusion and a desire to understand the appropriate response, rather than exhibiting signs of significant distress. the questions posed, such as whether they are a horrible person or if they should apologize, indicate a typical interpersonal dilemma rather than overwhelming stress. the reference to the boyfriend being drunk adds context to the situation, implying that the conflict may be influenced by temporary factors rather than a deep-seated issue. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of severe emotional turmoil, such as expressions of hopelessness, chronic anxiety, or an inability to cope, which are more characteristic of individuals experiencing stress. instead, it presents a common relational concern that many people navigate in their daily lives."
"I'm taking care of her but I have no idea what to do with myself. **TL;DR: My wife told her co-worker that she and I were in an open relationship and started hooking up with him. She said it's because I have too high a libido, because our relationship lost it's newness, and because I don't do a fair share of housework. I'm not sure if we can work it out or if I should just leave. **",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily revolving around the individual's personal relationship and emotional state. the author expresses confusion and uncertainty about their role and actions, suggesting a significant level of distress and helplessness. the mention of the wife’s infidelity and the reasons she provided for it—such as high libido, loss of relationship novelty, and unequal distribution of housework—highlight complex interpersonal issues that are likely contributing to the author's stress. these factors indicate feelings of inadequacy, betrayal, and a struggle to manage household responsibilities, all of which are common stressors. the author's contemplation of whether to try to resolve the situation or leave the relationship further underscores their emotional turmoil and indecision, both of which are typical indicators of stress."
"The worst he's ever done is yell. He does not seek out confrontation and he certainly doesn't threaten people. That's not to say he couldn't hold his own in a fight.

I bought a used car so I could get out sometimes and look for a job, he took the car to work (instead of his retired parent's car as planned) so I was stuck at home again. I got pregnant, we got married.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events and decisions without explicit emotional distress. the author details meeting a partner, moving to start a business, and encountering financial and logistical challenges. while these situations could be stressful, the tone remains factual and lacks language that typically indicates stress, such as expressions of anxiety, overwhelm, or frustration. the focus is on recounting events rather than conveying personal emotional turmoil. this straightforward recounting of circumstances suggests a coping or problem-solving mindset rather than one dominated by stress."

I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned.

"I tend not to like driving long distances in cars with people in unfamiliar places still but I feel good just that I am back on the road even if I don't drive the car.

I still had my job, so I was just relaxing and enjoying my newfound freedom.",0,"the narrative describes a significant life change where the individual left a stressful situation with their foster parents and chose to run away. despite the drastic action of running away and skipping college finals, the person highlights feelings of relief and freedom after the decision. the use of phrases like ""relaxed in the downtown area"" and ""enjoying my newfound freedom"" indicates a positive emotional state rather than ongoing stress. the continued engagement with their job also suggests a level of stability and normalcy in their life. these elements are indicative of someone who has found relief and is not currently experiencing stress, as they are focusing on the positive aspects of their new situation rather than dwelling on past difficulties."
"! I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from. I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it! ! EDIT 2 ..",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of entrapment and despair, characterized by the imagery of being in an inescapable pit. the individual explicitly acknowledges persistent anxiety and fear of failure, which are common indicators of stress. the cyclical nature of their anxiety leading to decreased focus and subsequent mistakes exacerbates their stress levels. the self-deprecating thoughts and the desire for self-harm are alarming signs of severe emotional distress. the language used, such as ""terrified,"" ""belittle,"" and ""covered in blood and bruises,"" underscores the intensity of their negative self-perception and emotional turmoil. these elements collectively highlight the significant psychological strain the individual is experiencing."
"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1,"the narrative reflects a history of significant trauma and ongoing emotional conflict. the writer describes a tumultuous childhood marked by an unstable family structure and exposure to severe domestic violence. witnessing such extreme abuse, even if not directly targeted at the individual, can have lasting psychological impacts, including stress, anxiety, and complex emotional responses. the writer's discomfort with their mother's reaction to the father's illness suggests an internal struggle with feelings of empathy, resentment, and moral conflict. the inability to openly communicate these feelings with their mother further indicates a strained relationship and unresolved emotional issues. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as they highlight the writer's ongoing battle with past trauma, current emotional turmoil, and difficulties in managing interpersonal relationships."
"I am still passionate about world cuisines and good food in general, but I want it to feel like fuel, feeding a good fire, it cannot feel like stuffing for this turkey.

Share that too!",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's interest in world cuisines and good food, which indicates a positive engagement with a pleasurable activity. the use of phrases like ""passionate about world cuisines"" and ""feeding a good fire"" suggests a healthy and enthusiastic attitude toward eating. the mention of mirtazapine, a medication known to affect appetite, is presented in a casual and inquisitive manner, seeking to understand others' experiences rather than expressing distress or frustration. the overall tone is conversational and open, inviting others to share their experiences without any evident signs of anxiety or overwhelming concern. these aspects collectively suggest a state of curiosity and normalcy rather than stress."
Fines. Probation. Court-ordered anger management classes. Debt. Final notices on some bills totaling as little as $17.,0,"the narrative mentions various stress-inducing elements such as fines, probation, court-ordered anger management classes, debt, and final notices on bills. however, the lack of emotional language or personal reflection in the narrative suggests that the individual is listing these factors in a detached manner. this detachment can indicate a sense of control or acceptance rather than active stress. typically, individuals experiencing stress would express feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, or frustration, none of which are present here. instead, the narrative reads as a straightforward enumeration of circumstances without any indication of how these issues are impacting the individual's emotional state. this lack of emotional response is a key indicator that the person may not be experiencing significant stress despite the challenging situations described."
"He seemed satisfied with this and kept pouring me drinks. Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house, tipsy and confused about what had just happened, but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies. Although I had some more regular income I would often binge on the euphoria of having money (I was still a teenager after all), spend too much in my mania and then quickly sink into paranoia and avoidance when rent day came along.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through the description of emotional turmoil and self-destructive behavior. the author mentions feeling tipsy and confused, which can be seen as a coping mechanism for underlying stress. the metaphor of the rope against the neck loosening slightly suggests a temporary relief but not a resolution of deeper issues. the reference to being in a ""prison of depression"" highlights a persistent and debilitating mental state. self-destructive tendencies and the cyclical pattern of mania followed by paranoia and avoidance are classic signs of stress and underlying mental health struggles. these elements collectively indicate a high level of distress and instability in the author's life."
"Oh, I forgot Aversives. This is where the therapist is openly punitive, hostile or withholding, explicitly, in order to punish and teach you.

There is also telephone contact.",0,"the narrative discusses therapeutic techniques in a clinical and somewhat detached manner, focusing on the specifics of aversive methods and their application. the tone is informative and analytical rather than emotional, which is a key indicator that the author is not experiencing stress. they describe the punitive and structured nature of the therapy, mentioning mandatory sessions and telephone contact without expressing personal distress or anxiety about these methods. the reference to linehan's minimal ethical criticism is presented factually, without any emotional reaction or personal involvement. this objective and neutral approach suggests the author is discussing the topic from a professional or academic perspective rather than a personal, stress-induced one."
"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures. She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation."" In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on their partner's perception of their actions and the partner's struggles with self-worth and commitment due to past experiences. the author expresses understanding and patience, showing empathy towards their partner's difficulties. they acknowledge the partner's feelings and past trauma without exhibiting signs of personal distress. instead, they focus on their partner's challenges and the dynamics of their relationship in a thoughtful and considerate manner. the tone is reflective and analytical, rather than anxious or overwhelmed, which suggests a stable emotional state and a capacity for handling the situation with maturity and calmness. this indicates a lack of significant stress in the author's narrative."

We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.",1,"the narrative describes a series of emotionally taxing events and unstable relationships that are common indicators of stress. the sudden decision to rekindle a relationship, followed by immediate pregnancy, introduces significant life changes that can be overwhelming. the experience of severe morning sickness adds a physical burden, while bob's subsequent departure exacerbates the emotional strain by leaving the narrator isolated in a large house without necessary support. the narrator's neediness being met with disgust further contributes to feelings of abandonment and helplessness. the responsibility of managing a pregnancy and caring for a young child without support underscores the chronic stress and pressure the narrator faces. bob's love for his child contrasted with his lack of responsibility adds to the emotional turmoil, highlighting the instability and unpredictability of her situation. all these factors combined create a context rich with stress indicators, making the emotional and psychological strain evident."
"They are always calling me for everything, I don't even wanna answer my phone, but if I don't I may get yelled at. It has happened.

I had to cancel all my plans that day to go in. I couldn't stop myself.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects a high level of stress experienced by the individual. the constant calls and the pressure to answer the phone despite the fear of being yelled at are indicative of significant workplace stress. the mention of spending many days and nights in tears highlights emotional distress, which is a common symptom of chronic stress. the incident of throwing a fit and being forced to cancel plans due to an unexpected work demand on a day off further illustrates the lack of control and overwhelming nature of their job. these factors collectively point to a stressful environment, where the individual feels powerless and emotionally drained."
I go to the VA and I see people who need it more than me. I make a good living and only want to get on with life.

"I won’t have to make that decision to either shut up and let him have his way or or risk my safety and the safety of my family. I’m not bound to him anymore, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t panic at the end of each day in the split second that I think it’s going to happen again.

"And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think. Did he kill himself because of me? Did he know I wanted to see him or did they simply never told him? Is it my fault he is dead now, and that my little brother has no father anymore? I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of confusion and overwhelming emotional turmoil, which are common indicators of stress. the writer repeatedly expresses uncertainty and self-doubt, asking questions that suggest a significant amount of guilt and responsibility for a tragic event. the mention of a death and the impact on a family member, particularly a little brother losing his father, amplifies the emotional weight of the situation. such intense self-blame and the struggle to process complex emotions are strong psychological signs of stress. the writer's inability to find clarity or resolution in their thoughts further highlights their distressed state."
"She told me she had one more person to interview and that she would get back to me by Monday. I shook her hand and rushed out the store to another place and went to their restroom.

"I have had mobility issues since I was twenty three following a difficult pregnancy that triggered inflammatory arthritis and fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. Over the years I've had a few falls due to being very unsteady on my feet at the best of times, which have added to my mobility issues. My right ankle and calf are permanently injured, I have achilles tendonitis, plantar faciitis and the muscle in my calf has tightened so much due to the shortening of my tendons that my foot points instead of sitting normally.

Also, important to note: she is an alcoholic, very intelligent (was a biologist), has had mental issues since 2005, and has been in and out of correctional facilities for various things related to drugs/drinking and violating parole. I haven't noticed her in a depressive state for over 3 years now.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation involving the writer's mother, who is experiencing homelessness, struggles with alcoholism, and has a history of mental health issues and encounters with the criminal justice system. despite these significant stressors, the writer's tone remains relatively neutral and factual. they provide a detailed account of their mother's circumstances without expressing overt emotional distress or anxiety. the mention of not having noticed their mother in a depressive state for over three years also suggests a level of stability in their perception of the situation. overall, the narrative reflects an objective recounting of events rather than an expression of personal stress."

I thought it wasn't my scene but I got an app called Headspace and it surprisingly helps. &#x200B; I've been close to killing myself 3 times.",1,"the narrative suggests a high level of stress due to the explicit mention of suicidal ideation, which is a critical indicator of severe emotional distress. the author discusses trying various methods to improve their mental health, such as consuming probiotic food and learning meditation, indicating an awareness of their mental state and an effort to find relief. the reference to nearly committing suicide multiple times highlights the intensity of their struggle, underscoring the seriousness of their stress. the inclusion of specific strategies like using the headspace app suggests they are actively seeking ways to manage their stress, but the gravity of their suicidal thoughts cannot be overlooked. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress and psychological distress."

"Who do I talk to at this point, the Command Equal Opportunity Officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn't seem concerned. There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change. Basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. If you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels unsupported and stigmatized within their environment. the mention of seeking help from the command equal opportunity officer and not feeling reassured by her response highlights a sense of helplessness and frustration. the stigma associated with asking for help and taking medication is a significant stressor, as it isolates the individual and exacerbates feelings of being an outcast. being removed from duties and watching others take on additional work while being unable to contribute can lead to feelings of guilt and worthlessness. the fear of being separated from the navy for speaking out about mental health issues adds to the stress, as it threatens the individual's career and sense of belonging. these aspects of the narrative are indicative of stress due to the lack of support, stigma, and potential career consequences faced by the individual."
"No really guess!.... This IS THE LAST TIME!!! THIS IS IT!!!! Fast forward , she goes a little further this time and consults an Attorney Firm. She always said money was problem , and me being an idiot said I dknt care I'll make a plan so that this evil doesn't have to be in our lives, She calls Me to say that the Attorneys need $250 for an Eviction Letter to him.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving legal consultation and financial concerns, but it lacks the emotional intensity and specific stress indicators typical of someone experiencing significant stress. the language used, while expressive, does not convey overwhelming anxiety or distress. phrases like ""this is the last time!!! this is it!!!!"" suggest a sense of finality or resolution rather than ongoing stress. the mention of making a plan to address the problem and the straightforward description of the financial requirement for an eviction letter indicate a practical approach to resolving the issue. there is no indication of pervasive worry, hopelessness, or emotional turmoil, which are common signs of stress. the narrative's focus on action and problem-solving rather than emotional struggle supports the classification."
"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story. I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1,"the narrative reveals a deeply unsettling experience characterized by fear, manipulation, and threats of violence. the author's recounting of the individual's behavior—praying angrily, admitting to suicidal threats, and speaking of violent thoughts towards an ex—highlights a series of distressing and alarming interactions. these elements suggest a constant state of tension and fear, typical indicators of stress. the author's description of feeling chills and the unsettling nature of the conversations further underscores the emotional and psychological turmoil they are experiencing. the repeated instances of manipulation and the individual's attempts to control the narrative around their past relationships add layers of anxiety and mistrust, reinforcing the overall atmosphere of stress in the narrative."
"The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time, but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know, this episode could have been anything or nothing, but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time, I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot, so I wasn't concerned - until I started to lose my vision.",1,"the narrative describes an episode where the individual experienced a significant sense of anxiety during a tram ride, which escalated to the point of losing vision. despite having no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness, the person felt a strong sense of anxiety that they initially attributed to paranoia induced by marijuana use. the mention of a physical symptom like vision loss indicates a high level of stress. even though the days following the incident were mostly normal and included enjoyable social interactions, the individual still felt slight anxiety intermittently. these elements, particularly the intense anxiety and physical symptoms experienced during the tram ride, are typical indicators of stress. the individual's concern and the lasting impact of the episode, despite an otherwise normal period, further support the presence of stress."
"I really liked this guy, he was super funny and easy to talk to, and he seemed really trustworthy to me. He told me he had been keeping an eye on me since he saw Pedo talking to me a lot and hanging around me a lot. He told me that two other girls around my age had worked with him before me, but not at the same time. Both girls had quit a couple of months into their jobs, even though they were doing well, seemed happy and very much liked their positions. He told me that both girls had complained a few times to him that Pedo had grown very attached to them and made them feel very uncomfortable, but didn’t know what to do because he was their boss.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a trusted individual who shares concerns about a potentially inappropriate and uncomfortable situation at work. the storyteller recounts how two previous employees felt uneasy due to the actions of their boss but does not express any personal anxiety or distress about their own experience. instead, the tone remains calm and factual, focusing on the experiences of others rather than their own emotional state. the lack of personal stress indicators, such as feelings of anxiety, fear, or distress about their situation, suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress."

I decided to head on over to cancer just to see other people’s point of views of things.",0,"the narrative presents a generally calm and factual recounting of the writer's family health history. the writer expresses relief that neither they nor most of their family members have cancer. the mention of the grandmother's stage 3 lung cancer is presented in a matter-of-fact tone, with no indication of immediate distress or anxiety. the writer's curiosity about other people's experiences with cancer seems more like an intellectual pursuit rather than a stress response. overall, the narrative lacks signs of heightened emotional distress or overwhelming concern, which are typical indicators of stress. the writer's tone remains steady and composed, suggesting they are not currently experiencing significant stress."
"7) what if there arent enough houses for all the people in this world? ( yes..seriously) we have never lost him, he has never been stung by a bee, we do not have the news on around him, nor has our house been broken into.However, he has heard grown ups out in public talking about the recent school shooting. He also gets night terrors and nightmares and is afraid to fall asleep sometimes. how do I help him manage his anxiety in an age appropriate way?",1,"the narrative expresses significant concern for a child's well-being, highlighting a range of stressors that the child is experiencing. the mention of night terrors, nightmares, and fear of falling asleep are clear indicators of anxiety and stress. the child's exposure to discussions about traumatic events, such as a school shooting, even if not directly witnessed, contributes to his anxiety. the parent's worry about managing the child's anxiety in an age-appropriate way further underscores the presence of stress within the household. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of concern and stress, both for the child and the parent, reflecting a scenario where stress is a prominent issue."
"She embarrass him in front of others. Last weekend was really what made me decide to write this. Jay, Marie, me and the husband were at another couples house. We were drinking and playing board games but Jay had to work the next day so he stopped early. Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.",0,"the narrative describes a social situation involving several individuals where one person, marie, expresses frustration towards jay. despite this, the overall tone and context do not suggest significant distress on the part of the narrator. the focus is more on recounting an incident rather than expressing personal emotional turmoil. the narrator mentions the event in a matter-of-fact manner, providing details about the gathering and marie's reaction without delving into their own emotional response or showing signs of being overwhelmed. typical indicators of stress, such as feelings of helplessness, anxiety, or pervasive negative thoughts, are not evident in this account. instead, the narrative is straightforward and descriptive, indicating a level of detachment from the incident."
"I’m currently doing EMDR for my severe anxiety issues and depression. We’re going through past instances that have plagued me and are why my mindset is a negative shithole. I had my anxiety in a certain place, where I felt comfortable. The anxiety was there but I managed it well enough. Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual is undergoing emdr therapy, which is often used for treating severe anxiety and depression, suggesting significant psychological distress. they mention their mindset being a ""negative shithole,"" indicating pervasive negative thoughts and emotions. the reference to past instances that have ""plagued"" them implies ongoing trauma or unresolved issues contributing to their current mental state. although they mention managing their anxiety to some extent, the use of terms like ""severe anxiety"" and the acknowledgment that ""things were not perfect"" and that ""a lot of things needed to change"" further underscore a state of chronic stress and a continuous struggle with their mental health. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress experienced by the individual."
"I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood, but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so), but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, stemming from multiple traumatic and distressing events. the individual describes a strained relationship with their mother, who has displayed narcissistic behaviors and recently disowned them over a reddit post. the sudden and harsh rejection by a close family member can be deeply stressful and emotionally destabilizing. additionally, the mention of enduring the silent treatment for two weeks indicates ongoing emotional neglect and conflict, which are common stressors. the individual also reveals a recent sexual assault by an acquaintance, an event that is profoundly traumatic and can have long-lasting psychological effects. the convergence of these stressors—family conflict, rejection, emotional neglect, and trauma—creates a highly stressful environment, making it understandable why the individual is experiencing significant stress."
"He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc. My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea. He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations. I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.",0,"the narrative reflects a person experiencing relationship concerns and insecurities, but it does not necessarily indicate a state of stress. the individual acknowledges the positive aspects of their relationship, such as having an equal partnership and a satisfying sex life. they are aware of their own tendencies to feel hurt and rejected when their partner is not interested in sex on certain days, but they also recognize these feelings as somewhat irrational and are self-reflective about their own expectations. the concern about potentially hurting their partner in the future suggests a level of introspection and a desire to maintain the relationship's health. these elements point to normal relationship dynamics and personal growth rather than indicators of significant stress."
I just wanted to thank everyone on this sub reddit for answering my crazy questions. Also for answering my questions with obvious answers when I was too crazy to see the answers. I have been homeless for 3 months. Not anymore! I have my own room I'm renting from a very nice family.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of relief and gratitude rather than stress. the individual expresses appreciation for the support received from the online community, which indicates a positive social interaction and the presence of a support system. the use of phrases like ""thank everyone"" and ""very nice family"" suggests positive emotions and a sense of stability. the mention of having been homeless for 3 months but now having their own room signifies a transition from a stressful situation to a more secure and stable living condition. this shift in circumstances likely contributes to a reduction in stress levels, as the individual no longer faces the immediate challenges associated with homelessness. overall, the tone and content of the narrative point to an improved state of well-being and reduced stress."
"Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples, like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and I’m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all. I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels uncomfortable with their partner's actions, specifically the playful but unwanted physical contact. despite expressing discomfort and a clear preference for the behavior to stop, the partner continues, dismissing the individual's feelings by calling them a baby or saying it's just a joke. this ongoing disregard for personal boundaries and the individual's expressed discomfort are typical indicators of stress. the repeated need to assert boundaries and the partner's minimization of their feelings contribute to a sense of helplessness and ongoing emotional strain, which are relevant psychological insights pointing towards stress."
"Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent, father, having them go into a basement as one was nearby). I believe this to be a slight misdiagnosis and the focus of the treatment to be incorrect. I'm looking for support from others that have had similar experiences and perhaps know a bit more about the differences between PD, PTSD, and CPTSD. Going to attempt to summarize the background info with bullet points. -Together for 5 years, married for 1.",0,"the narrative presents a detailed account of an individual's concern about a diagnosis received by someone close to them. it highlights the person's skepticism regarding the accuracy of the ptsd diagnosis and expresses a desire for support and information about related disorders. the tone of the narrative is analytical and focused on seeking clarity rather than displaying emotional distress. the author mentions specific details, such as the length of the relationship and the context of the fear of tornadoes, which further suggests a methodical approach to understanding the situation. the absence of personal emotional turmoil or urgency in the language indicates a state of non-stress."
"But in that moment neither my words nor my body made a difference...he did what he wanted.... I wanted to push him, kick him, shout...but...i couldnt move. There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply distressing and traumatic experience, highlighting feelings of helplessness and violation. the individual recounts an inability to move or resist, which is a common response in high-stress situations where the body may enter a state of freeze. the mention of wanting to push, kick, and shout but being unable to do so indicates a significant level of emotional and physical paralysis. the shift in perception of the other person from gentle and respectful to someone who disregards consent is a profound betrayal, contributing to emotional turmoil. the breakdown upon returning home suggests a delayed emotional response, often seen in individuals who have endured traumatic events. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and trauma, as the individual navigates the aftermath of a deeply unsettling and non-consensual encounter."
"I was trying to eat my food but my hands became shaky and i then didnt feel hungry. People kept asking me why my hands are shaky, and the people across from me laughing at me.

I havent been diagnose for anxiety disorder but i want to been on medication?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes physical symptoms such as shaky hands and loss of appetite, which are common physiological responses to stress and anxiety. the social context of being questioned and laughed at by colleagues exacerbates these feelings, highlighting a significant social stressor. the mention of working at the place for three years but still struggling with anxiety suggests a chronic issue rather than a situational one. the aversion to meetings and social gatherings further indicates a persistent discomfort in social settings, which is often associated with anxiety disorders. the person's contemplation about seeking medication also underscores the severity of their stress and their desire for relief. these elements collectively point towards an ongoing struggle with stress and anxiety."
If you knew Garret you would never have seen this coming. The family is exhausted at this point. I just want to do anything I can to help them and this is the platform I have. Any little thing helps. I can't think of a more caring family that is totally deserving of any help they can get.,0,"the narrative reflects a tone of concern and empathy towards garret and his family, but it does not exhibit signs of personal stress from the author. the focus is on providing support and expressing a desire to help, which are indicative of compassion rather than stress. the language used, such as ""i just want to do anything i can to help them"" and ""any little thing helps,"" suggests a proactive and supportive stance. while the family is described as exhausted, the author does not convey their own stress or anxiety, instead emphasizing the worthiness of the family's situation and their need for assistance. the absence of self-referential stress indicators, such as feelings of being overwhelmed or anxious, further supports the non-stress classification."
"Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account, my wages are immediately garnished. However, last night was the real wake up call. After work, I came home drunk and let my stress get the best of me. I ended up getting in a fight with my gf about money, finances and utilities. Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have ""sugar momma"" for a girlfriend, I packed everything I own in my vehicle, parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.",1,"the narrative reveals multiple indicators of stress. the author describes financial difficulties, such as wages being garnished, which is a significant stressor. the situation escalates when the author comes home drunk, a behavior often associated with attempts to cope with stress. the fight with the girlfriend about money, finances, and utilities further highlights ongoing stressors related to financial instability and relationship tension. the author's decision to pack belongings and sleep in the car indicates a high level of distress and a desire to escape the current stressful environment. these actions and emotions are consistent with someone experiencing significant stress."
"Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?",1,"the narrative reflects a pattern of introspection and rumination, which are common indicators of stress. the individual discusses feeling tired and how it leads to negative emotions like anger, suggesting a cycle of stress and fatigue. the mention of wondering whether the feelings are due to biological sleepiness or a conditioned response points to a heightened awareness of their mental state, which can be a sign of stress. the casual inquiry about others' well-being at the end contrasts with the earlier self-focused analysis, highlighting a possible attempt to shift focus away from their own distress. overall, the detailed contemplation of their emotional responses and the connection between sleep and negative feelings are indicative of an underlying stress condition."
"Hi, I am 21 years old, I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year, but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time, i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that, my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls, it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?",1,"the narrative describes a history of panic attacks and anxiety, which the individual managed to overcome. however, the person continues to experience physical symptoms such as feeling faint, having a pale face, and feeling pressure in the eyeballs. these symptoms occur during both university classes and daily activities, suggesting a persistent concern about their health and well-being. despite normal blood test results, the individual's focus on these physical sensations and their connection to past anxiety episodes indicate ongoing worry and stress. the recurrent nature of these symptoms, particularly in everyday situations, points to underlying anxiety that hasn't been fully resolved. such physical manifestations are common indicators of stress and anxiety, reflecting the body's response to perceived threats or unresolved emotional tension."
"Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional distress and concern over legal and familial issues. the individual expresses frustration and disappointment regarding the legal outcomes related to their father's past actions, indicating a deep-seated emotional turmoil. the desire for a more severe charge (felony instead of misdemeanor) against the father, coupled with the concern over the sufficiency of evidence and the father's attempts to evade law enforcement, underscores a sense of injustice and helplessness. these elements, including the recounting of past incidents and the uncertainty about future legal proceedings, are indicative of significant stress. the narrative's focus on legal ramifications and the emotional impact on the family further highlight the ongoing tension and anxiety experienced by the individual."
"First and foremost, I am not a veteran. I found out about PTSD service dogs from my good friend who also suffers from PTSD and is in the process of training her pup to be a service dog. I have found some helpful resources online giving information about service dogs for PTSD, but most of them seem to be geared toward either: therapy dogs or PTSD dogs only for veterans. <url> ➡️ are all trainings this expensive? <url> ➡️ awesome article, but this website is also for veterans",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is researching ptsd service dogs and their training. the writer mentions discovering this information through a friend and finding online resources, which indicates proactive behavior rather than stress. the focus is on gathering information and understanding the costs and availability of training, which reflects a problem-solving approach. the narrative does not include expressions of personal distress, anxiety, or overwhelming emotions. instead, it highlights curiosity and a desire to learn more, which are not typical indicators of stress. the mention of a friend undergoing similar training further suggests a supportive social context rather than isolation or heightened stress."

I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily centered around the individual's interpersonal relationships and underlying anxiety. the mention of seeing the person 1-3 times per week, primarily in restaurants, suggests a lack of deeper personal connection, as they have never been to each other's apartments. the detail about his lease prohibiting guests might contribute to feelings of exclusion or confusion. the individual's invitation to their apartment being declined or not working out further exacerbates these feelings. the mention of abandonment issues from past friendships highlights a history of emotional distress, leading to heightened anxiety about the current relationship. the explicit statement of anxiety about whether the person actually likes them underscores a preoccupation with acceptance and fear of rejection, which are classic indicators of stress. overall, the narrative is characterized by uncertainty, insecurity, and emotional turmoil, all of which are symptomatic of a stressed state."
"When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama, but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.",1,"the narrative describes a person who has experienced significant mental health challenges and has made efforts to manage their condition through medication and lifestyle changes. despite initial success in weaning off prozac and reducing social media use to avoid stress, the individual reports a recurrence of depression symptoms. key indicators of stress include self-isolation, decreased communication with a spouse, and paranoia about neighbors' perceptions. these behaviors suggest heightened anxiety and a retreat from social interactions, which are common responses to stress and depression. the mention of using klonopin for severe attacks further underscores the ongoing struggle with anxiety."

Day later it went away, but the day after that I got the worst body aches, chills, 100.6 fever, and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief, it keeps me up at night, and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do? I can't see a doctor for 2 more weeks as I am out of town on a job, i think I am a hypocongiract so ii worry a lot lol.",1,"the narrative describes a series of physical symptoms that have persisted over several days, including a throat burn, body aches, fever, chills, dizziness, and a dry cough that disrupts sleep. these symptoms are concerning and can cause significant distress. the mention of being unable to see a doctor for two weeks due to being out of town on a job adds a layer of anxiety about the inability to access medical care promptly. the individual's self-identification as a ""hypocongiract"" (likely meant to be hypochondriac) indicates a tendency to worry excessively about health issues, which is a common psychological indicator of stress. the combination of ongoing physical discomfort, sleep disruption, and health-related anxiety are all strong indicators of stress in this narrative."
"I have almost constant health anxiety. It's a mixture of agoraphobia and health anxiety. I'm afraid of having some incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing... I've been kinda iffy the past few days, just tired from lack of sleep, and I usually feel like shit after my period which triggers my anxiety. Well anyway I went out to meet my mom for some food and the first thing she says to me is ""wow are you okay?""",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of constant health anxiety and the fear of having an incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing. these are classic symptoms of anxiety disorders, which are often accompanied by physical manifestations such as tiredness from lack of sleep. the mention of feeling worse after a period suggests a potential link between hormonal changes and anxiety levels, which is a known phenomenon. the encounter with the mother, where the first comment is about the narrator's well-being, reinforces the visible impact of stress on their physical appearance. these elements collectively point towards a heightened state of psychological distress."
"I did something once that I had been doing almost constantly in the intervening years: I imagined my ex-fiancee. But this time, it felt real. ""Through the lord, all things are possible"" Shock, bliss, happiness, peace, closure, and many other emotions multiplied beyond reckoning coursed through me. I promised my life to God, and continue to believe that he did speak to me.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is experiencing a profound sense of peace and closure. the emotions described, such as bliss, happiness, and peace, are typically associated with a positive and resolved state of mind rather than stress. the mention of imagining the ex-fiancee, while it might initially suggest lingering thoughts, is quickly followed by a transformative spiritual experience that leads to a feeling of closure. this sense of closure and the ongoing belief in a divine encounter suggest that the person has found a meaningful way to cope with any past emotional turmoil. the focus on positive emotions and a strong spiritual conviction indicates a state of emotional stability and contentment, rather than stress."
"I don't have a therapist right now, and I don't really talk much to anyone about this. Right now, I can articulate how it feels, because it's still fresh. But when I'm feeling good, I have trouble discussing my anxiety. It's not something I want to delve into when I'm in a good mood. I'm not really sure where I was going with this or what I'm looking for, but I just wanted to vent since this was fresh on my mind right now.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is currently experiencing a period of relative stability and is able to articulate their feelings about anxiety. while they acknowledge the presence of anxiety and the challenge of discussing it during better times, the tone of the narrative is more about reflection rather than active distress. the person mentions wanting to vent because the feelings are fresh, indicating a momentary need to express thoughts rather than a pervasive state of stress. there is no immediate sense of overwhelming pressure or panic, but rather a thoughtful observation of their emotional state. the desire to talk about it while feeling good shows a level of self-awareness and control, which are not typical indicators of high stress. the overall context suggests a person who is managing their feelings and seeking a healthy outlet for expression."
"I spent six years in a very abusive relationship. We had a child together. After she was born, I made my way out. I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him. There’s been a long history.",1,"the narrative describes a prolonged period of distress and trauma, indicative of a stressful experience. the mention of an abusive relationship spanning six years highlights a significant and continuous source of emotional and possibly physical strain. the birth of a child and the subsequent decision to leave the abusive partner suggests a pivotal moment of intense stress, both in the act of leaving and in the responsibilities of single parenthood. the need to flee multiple residences underscores ongoing fear and instability, which are strong indicators of chronic stress. the phrase ""theres been a long history"" further implies a deep-seated and persistent struggle, often associated with long-term psychological effects such as anxiety, hypervigilance, and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). these elements collectively paint a picture of an individual who has endured significant stress."
"He said he’d never love us. He acknowledges and plays with his daughter starting after she turned 6 months. He use to threaten to take her away from me. He gets delusional at times and he yelled at me “I’m going to off myself if you don’t admit that you were going to call the cops on me for calling the manager at McDonald’s an asshole!” I filmed it. So he said, “here’s your daughter try not to off yourself” He really thinks I’m going to kill myself for no reason....",0,"the narrative describes interactions with an individual who displays erratic and potentially abusive behavior. while the content includes distressing elements, such as threats and accusations, the tone of the narrative lacks the introspective or emotionally charged language typically associated with someone experiencing significant stress. instead, the narrator recounts events and statements made by another person in a relatively detached manner, focusing more on the actions and words of the other individual rather than expressing personal feelings of anxiety, worry, or overwhelm. the absence of self-referential distress or emotional turmoil suggests that the narrator is not currently experiencing high levels of stress, despite the challenging circumstances described."
Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of significant stress. the author expresses a deep sense of inadequacy and failure, feeling that their efforts are not recognized as successful. this sentiment is often linked to chronic stress and low self-esteem. the mention of the carpet covered in animal urine evokes a traumatic memory from the author's childhood, which likely contributes to their current emotional distress. such environmental triggers are common in individuals with unresolved past traumas. the reference to feeling overwhelmed by confrontation, likening it to a major conflict, suggests a heightened stress response and difficulty managing everyday stressors. the sense of being unfairly blamed and unable to cope further underscores the presence of stress, as it indicates a pervasive feeling of helplessness and being overburdened. all these elements combined point to a narrative deeply rooted in stress and emotional turmoil."
"Do I live in this cycle forever? Is there really no chance for me? I can't even begin to explain how my sibling got out, it was pure luck and they are heavily dependent on an S/O. I feel like I'm grabbing at straws. I've done this song and dance a million times.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of hopelessness and frustration, which are common indicators of stress. phrases like ""do i live in this cycle forever?"" and ""is there really no chance for me?"" suggest feelings of entrapment and despair. the mention of the sibling's escape being attributed to ""pure luck"" and dependence on a significant other further underscores the narrator's perception of their own situation as bleak and unchangeable. the expression ""grabbing at straws"" conveys a sense of desperation and futile effort, while ""i've done this song and dance a million times"" indicates a repetitive, exhausting struggle without resolution. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and emotional turmoil."
"I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him. He was too big for them to punish. So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything. They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly. Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the writer's experiences and emotions. the individual describes a troubling family dynamic where a younger child is being bullied by an older sibling, and the parents are either unable or unwilling to intervene. the phrase ""i endured it"" suggests a prolonged period of suffering and helplessness, which are common stress indicators. the writer also expresses feelings of resentment and anger towards their family for their lack of support, highlighting emotional distress. the statement ""some days i hate my whole family"" underscores a deep-seated frustration and emotional turmoil. additionally, the mention of living with another brother at 18 suggests a continued struggle with family relationships. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative filled with stress, emotional pain, and unresolved familial conflict."
"I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and frustration, which are strong indicators of stress. the author explicitly mentions feeling isolated despite being surrounded by others, highlighting a significant emotional disconnect. the disappointment and alienation stemming from others' lack of understanding of ptsd in non-veterans further exacerbate these feelings. the mention of dissociations and the unacceptable nature of these experiences for non-military individuals adds to the sense of being misunderstood and unsupported. such emotions are common in individuals experiencing stress, particularly when dealing with conditions like ptsd that are not widely recognized or understood in their context. the narrative's tone and content reflect the inner turmoil and social challenges that often accompany high stress levels."
He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,1,"the narrative describes a situation involving physical injury and a lack of support from someone close, which are significant indicators of stress. the mention of a ""gaping wound"" and a ""hole in my lip"" suggests severe physical trauma, a clear source of distress. the fact that the individual felt compelled to call the police because they couldn't drive and had no other option highlights a sense of helplessness and urgency, both common in stressful situations. the decision by the police department not to press charges likely adds to the individual's feelings of frustration and abandonment. these elements combined—physical pain, lack of immediate support, and feelings of helplessness—are strong indicators of stress."
I need help. I need sound advice on how I can overcome this situation. I need brutal honesty. Merci ! Please excuse my grammatical errors,1,"the narrative exhibits clear indicators of stress through its urgent and repetitive pleas for assistance. the repeated use of ""i need"" underscores a sense of desperation and an immediate need for support. the request for ""brutal honesty"" suggests a person who is seeking clarity and resolution, possibly feeling overwhelmed by their current situation. the use of ""merci"" and the apology for grammatical errors may indicate a preoccupation with being understood and accepted, which can be common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress. these elements collectively highlight the author's distress and their urgent desire for effective solutions."
Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.,1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of regret, self-loathing, and emotional pain. the individual explicitly mentions hating themselves and their past life, which signifies a deep sense of personal dissatisfaction and internal conflict. the mention of horror and memories they have to live with suggests the presence of traumatic experiences that continue to affect their mental state. the fact that they have ceased using alcohol or drugs, yet still feel overwhelmed, points to an ongoing struggle with coping mechanisms. the overall tone conveys a pervasive sense of shame and hopelessness, which are common psychological symptoms associated with stress and possibly underlying mental health issues such as depression or anxiety."
"I just got an email to schedule an interview for a job. I haven’t heard from the lady a few days after thinking it would take her a few days to figure a time for me to come in and email back. Nope she CALLED ME on the home phone instead today. First off I didn’t know because the caller ID said cellular call and usually I don’t answer those calls because their scams. I later looked up the number I have an app that tells if it’s a scam number, what business it is, landline etc.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with the logistics of scheduling a job interview. the person initially expects to receive an email but instead receives a phone call. there is no indication of heightened anxiety or stress in the way the situation is described. the individual uses rational problem-solving by looking up the number with an app to verify its legitimacy. the tone of the narrative remains calm and factual, focusing on the sequence of events rather than expressing worry or distress. this level-headed approach and lack of emotional turmoil are typical indicators that the person is not experiencing significant stress."

I can't state concisely what I'm thinking.",1,"the narrative exhibits clear signs of stress through several key indicators. the individual describes an inability to overcome a persistent negative feeling, which is a common symptom of stress. they mention that ""nothing feels good,"" indicating a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction or anhedonia, often associated with stress and anxiety. despite having the opportunity to engage in a positive activity like working out during spring break, the person still felt ""overwhelmingly anxious,"" suggesting that their stress is not alleviated by typical stress-reducing activities. furthermore, the difficulty in articulating thoughts concisely points to cognitive disruptions, such as racing thoughts or mental fog, which are frequently reported by individuals under significant stress. these elements collectively underscore a state of heightened stress in the individual's experience."
"I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know, I don't know what to do.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the writer expresses feelings of confusion and guilt, which are common signs of psychological distress. phrases like ""i feel like pure shit"" and ""i do not know what to do"" highlight a sense of helplessness and self-blame. the uncertainty about the other person's belief in the accidental nature of the incident adds to the stress, as it suggests a concern about judgment and potential misunderstanding. the repeated emphasis on not knowing how to manage the situation further underscores the writer's anxiety and inability to cope effectively. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of emotional turmoil and stress."
"If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later."" While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily stemming from a toxic and abusive relationship. the individual describes a partner who exhibits controlling and manipulative behavior, such as getting angry if tasks aren't completed and borrowing money without repayment, despite having a substantial income. this financial exploitation creates a sense of powerlessness and anxiety. furthermore, the partner's coercive sexual demands, exemplified by the statement ""i'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later,"" contribute to a feeling of degradation and fear. the mention of increasing concern about subsequent behaviors indicates a growing awareness and stress response to the escalating abuse. these elements collectively highlight a distressing environment that is likely to cause significant emotional and psychological strain."

However she continued to talk to him and also continued to talk and flirt with the second co-worker, when she knew he had romantic feelings. She says she's sorry and has an addiction to being desired. I told her it's not fair to me or the men she's leading on. She agrees and is trying to convince me to stay with her.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and relational conflict, both of which are common indicators of stress. the writer describes a situation involving infidelity and emotional manipulation, which inherently carries a high emotional burden. the repeated apologies and admissions of an ""addiction to being desired"" from the partner suggest a cycle of behavior that is both distressing and difficult to break, contributing to the writer's stress. additionally, the writer's feelings of unfairness and the need to confront their partner about her actions further highlight the internal conflict and emotional strain they are experiencing. the partner's attempts to convince the writer to stay, despite the ongoing issues, add to the complexity and intensity of the situation, exacerbating the writer's stress levels. these elements collectively point to a narrative steeped in emotional distress and relational stress, making it a clear example of someone experiencing significant stress."
I don't know if I should call it abuse. Fiancé suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight. Last night was the 2nd time but far worse. He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet). My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and traumatic situation involving physical abuse and violent behavior from the narrator's fiancé, who suffers from ptsd and alcoholism. the detailed account of being punched, having objects thrown at them, and being beaten with a bag, resulting in a bleeding head, are clear indicators of acute stress and fear. the context of these events happening in public places like an international airport, and the escalation to a more severe incident at home, further emphasizes the chronic and escalating nature of the stress experienced. the narrator's uncertainty about labeling the experience as abuse also suggests a state of confusion and emotional turmoil, which are common psychological responses to sustained abusive environments. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of severe stress, including physical harm, fear for personal safety, and the impact of a partner's mental health issues on the relationship."

And I know I use a lot of my hours on them, but overlook it because I love them and know they want to see me. But I only have 6 hours left, and each shift is 4 hours. I might have to use 4 of those today because the front of my house is flooded (there's a car stuck there and an officer blocking off people from entering), because I emailed HR and even sent in a picture but this company just doesn't give a fuck and probably won't cancel.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and feeling overwhelmed, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses resentment about not being allowed to express their frustration, unlike others around them. they mention using a significant amount of unpaid time off for family obligations, which suggests a lack of personal time and increased pressure. the mention of a flooded house and an unresponsive hr department adds to the sense of helplessness and lack of control over their circumstances. these elements combined indicate a high level of stress, as the person is dealing with multiple sources of pressure without adequate support or relief."

He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him.

"You’re swimming smoothly with the current, the temperature isn’t too cold, and the water is calm and clear blue. So why can you only ever see it as being murky?

"I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist).

"Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere.

Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is dealing with a breakup due to the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. while the breakup and the constraints imposed by protective parents are difficult, the tone and content suggest a level of acceptance and rationalization. the person acknowledges the practical reasons behind the breakup, such as distance, school, and financial limitations, without displaying signs of acute distress or overwhelming emotion. the use of humor in mentioning ""homophobia lol"" indicates a coping mechanism rather than a sign of severe stress. overall, the narrative lacks the intensity and emotional turmoil typically associated with high stress, instead showing a measured and reflective perspective on the circumstances."

Does anyone else feel like this?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of stress. the author expresses feelings of isolation and misunderstanding, suggesting a lack of social support, which is a common stressor. the mention of taking a while to leave and not telling anyone until now implies a prolonged period of internal struggle and secrecy, which can heighten stress levels. the haunting nature of the past situation and the persistent feelings of guilt, despite recognizing their irrationality, indicate unresolved emotional distress and cognitive dissonance. these elements collectively point to the presence of stress, as the individual is grappling with ongoing emotional turmoil and a sense of personal responsibility for their circumstances. the question at the end about whether others feel the same further underscores their search for validation and connection, which are often sought by those experiencing stress."

It all started with the fact that one day I got out of bed, and had the weird idea that I was going to die at 21 yrs old. I was listening to The Doors at that point, and Black Sabbath and everything in between those two. And while listening to The Doors, it opened the the doors of perception to me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of detachment and a philosophical outlook rather than indicators of stress. the mention of forgetting about the biological father and focusing on a lesson from the father suggests a level of acceptance and possibly reconciliation with past issues. the anecdote about money and proving the father wrong is presented in a light-hearted, almost whimsical manner, indicating a playful challenge rather than a stressor. the sudden idea of dying at 21 is introduced but not explored in depth, and instead, the focus shifts to music and its impact on perception, hinting at introspection and self-discovery rather than anxiety or stress. the tone remains reflective and calm throughout, showing an individual more engaged in exploring thoughts and ideas rather than expressing distress or emotional turmoil."
"She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl in Nov 2017. Her partner is 26 yrs old and has had many bouts with the law. When he met my friend, he was on house arrest/probation for a previous charge. They worked together and soon began dating. My friend is a Filipino woman and her partner is a Jamaican man.",0,"the narrative describes a situation that, while containing potentially stressful elements, does not necessarily indicate the presence of stress in the individual recounting the story. the birth of a baby girl is generally a joyous event and is presented in a positive light. the mention of the partner's legal issues and house arrest/probation could be seen as stress-inducing factors, but the narrative does not convey any emotional distress or anxiety from the storyteller's perspective. instead, it provides a factual account of events without delving into any feelings of worry or tension. the focus remains on the description of the relationship and the background of the individuals involved, rather than on any internal emotional turmoil. thus, the absence of explicit stress indicators such as expressions of fear, anxiety, or overwhelming concern supports the interpretation that the narrative is not characterized by stress."
Could we all at least help out by chipping in at least a dollar for this van? Could we please give this family a break by helping and donating for this van!? These boys and her need it so much!! It would be worth every penny to be able to go on more play dates with her two boys and make their little live’s more adventurous. It would open up a door to giving them easier and more convenience access to fun spontaneous trips to go play and have fun.,0,"the narrative reflects a plea for assistance, focusing on the positive outcomes that could arise from community support. the language used is enthusiastic and hopeful, emphasizing the benefits of contributing to a cause that would improve the lives of a family. phrases like ""helping and donating,"" ""worth every penny,"" and ""more adventurous"" highlight an optimistic and proactive mindset. the narrative does not exhibit signs of personal distress or anxiety; instead, it conveys a sense of communal responsibility and collective effort. there is an absence of negative emotions or expressions of personal struggle, which are often indicative of stress. the focus remains on the potential joy and convenience that the contribution would bring, suggesting a positive and outward-looking perspective."
"I think this is a good conversation to have in person, but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tacky/wildly unromantic to do this over text/email? Additionally, I don't want to ruin things between us or make things weird, and I'm not sure how to broach the subject. How do I not screw this up? ---",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of anxiety and concern about communication and relationship dynamics, which are common indicators of stress. the individual is worried about the appropriateness of their actions, such as whether it would be tacky or unromantic to address a sensitive issue via text or email. this preoccupation with the potential negative outcomes of their choices, like ruining things or making the situation weird, further underscores their stress. the repeated questioning of how to approach the subject without screwing it up suggests a high level of self-doubt and fear of making mistakes, both of which are psychological signs of stress. the overall tone of the narrative indicates that the person is grappling with uncertainty and the pressure to navigate a delicate situation correctly, which are clear indicators of a stressed state."
"Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me. She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things. I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about. She doesn't agree, we talk about it. She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.",0,"the narrative reflects a conversation where the speaker is addressing a concern with another person. while there is a disagreement and some frustration evident, the tone and content do not indicate significant stress. the speaker calmly recounts the interaction, highlighting differing perspectives on forgetfulness and caring. the ability to articulate thoughts and engage in a dialogue, even when there is a disagreement, suggests a level of emotional regulation and control. the discussion appears to be more about differing viewpoints rather than an overwhelming stress response. the speaker's reasoning and communication indicate a relatively balanced state of mind."
"So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused, I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house). Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried, guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant emotional turmoil, which is a common indicator of stress. the individual describes a situation where they have experienced a conflict with someone they care deeply about, leading to feelings of worry, guilt, and longing for reconciliation. the repeated attempts to communicate and the emotional responses to being ignored highlight an ongoing preoccupation with the situation. phrases like ""i'm worried, guilty and just want to hug her"" suggest an intense emotional investment and distress. the use of emotive language and the depiction of a strained relationship are typical indicators of stress, as the individual is grappling with unresolved feelings and a strong desire to mend the relationship."
"He has even made a comment to my bf about me being overweight. Being overweight has basically taken over my relationship, my mind, and my life. This year, I am making it a priority to lose the weight, especially since I have nothing else occupying my mind like cancer. My confidence level right now is 0 and I feel so fucking ugly and fat. If I just got in shape, I know that I would be close to a 10.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress, as evidenced by the writer's preoccupation with their weight and its impact on various aspects of their life. the mention of a comment made by someone to their boyfriend about their weight indicates external judgment, which can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. the writer describes their weight as having taken over their relationship, mind, and life, suggesting an overwhelming and pervasive concern that dominates their thoughts and emotions. the statement about having nothing else occupying their mind ""like cancer"" implies a comparison to a serious illness, highlighting the severity of their distress. the writer's confidence level is described as zero, and they express strong negative self-perceptions, using words like ""ugly"" and ""fat."" these expressions of self-criticism and a desire for drastic change in their physical appearance are typical indicators of stress, particularly related to body image and self-worth. the intensity of these feelings and their impact on the writer's daily life underscore the presence of significant psychological distress."
"I generally like to finish the stuff I do that I consider to be work related but some things like video games, series or anything like that I don’t want to end. I am scared of finishing them since I know going back to it won’t be the same. After I finish them everything about it just feels so empty, like it has no value anymore. Knowing I can never experience it the same way again makes me not want it to end. I go from loving it and then afterwards never wanting anything to do with it anymore.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of attachment and emotional investment in activities like video games and series, but it doesn't indicate significant stress. the author expresses a fear of the finality and the emptiness that follows the completion of enjoyable activities, which is a common feeling rather than a stress indicator. the language used, such as ""i generally like to finish the stuff i do"" and ""i am scared of finishing them,"" suggests more of an emotional response to the transient nature of enjoyment rather than chronic stress. the concern about not being able to experience the same joy again and the shift from love to disinterest post-completion highlight a normal emotional process related to the anticipation and subsequent loss of novelty, rather than a stress response. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, pressure, or anxiety that typically characterize stress, focusing instead on a natural emotional reaction to the end of pleasurable experiences."
I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break. I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of stress. the individual expresses concern about their body's reaction to their partner, which suggests ongoing distress and possible trauma responses. the mention of early abuse and the difficulty in discussing it with therapists indicate unresolved trauma that continues to impact their mental health. the fear of breaking down when talking about the abuse and the physical reaction of tensing up are clear signs of anxiety and stress. the apology for rambling and the struggle to articulate emotions further highlight the emotional turmoil and difficulty in processing these experiences. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress related to past trauma and its effects on current relationships and mental well-being."
"For example, she once tried to stab her mum's boyfriend because she didn't want her mum to be with anyone - they were in their mid 60s. She has been in a lot of fights over the years, but in general isn't usually physically violent - it's usually manipulation. I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.",1,"the narrative describes a person exhibiting aggressive and manipulative behaviors, which are common indicators of stress. the account of trying to stab her mum's boyfriend due to possessiveness over her mother suggests intense emotional turmoil and a lack of impulse control, both of which are often seen in individuals under significant stress. the mention of numerous fights over the years, despite a general tendency towards manipulation rather than physical violence, further supports the presence of underlying stress. the recent incident where she ""lost it"" upon discovering her ex's private relationship points to an acute stress response, likely exacerbated by feelings of betrayal and loss of control. these behaviors, combined with the intensity of the emotional reactions described, are clear indicators of a stressed individual."
"This is the first time that i'm opening up about this, so please be kind. I'm from India - stereotypically known as the land of doctors and engineers. And while that's just a stereotype, my studies give me anxiety. I had my first attack two years ago - and I have been talking to people since then - but my recent graduation exams have left me worse then ever. What i want to know is, when was your first attack and how are you doing now?",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress. the writer mentions experiencing anxiety related to their studies, which is a common stressor, particularly in a culture that highly values academic achievement. the reference to having their first anxiety attack two years ago and continuing to struggle with it since then suggests ongoing stress. the recent graduation exams exacerbating their condition points to acute stress related to significant life events. the plea for kindness at the beginning indicates vulnerability and a need for support, which are often present in individuals experiencing stress. asking others about their experiences with anxiety attacks also shows a search for solidarity and understanding, which can be a coping mechanism for stress. overall, the combination of personal anxiety history, current exacerbation due to exams, and the emotional tone of the narrative are clear indicators of stress."
The place where I was going for therapy decided that they couldn't appropriately treat me. I've had a tough time finding another therapist. The strange thing is I've been feeling better out of therapy then when I was in it. I was doing a type of exposure therapy and it was rough. I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual had difficulty finding a suitable therapist after their previous therapy center decided they couldn't provide appropriate treatment. despite this challenge, the individual mentions feeling better out of therapy than when they were actively participating in it. the exposure therapy they were undergoing was intense and seemed to dominate their life, revolving around their trauma. however, the key indicator here is the individual's acknowledgment of an improvement in their well-being after discontinuing therapy. this sense of relief and betterment suggests a reduction in stress levels, as they are no longer subjected to the intense and consuming nature of the therapy sessions. the narrative reflects a shift towards a more positive mental state, indicating resilience and an ability to cope better without the previous therapeutic intervention."
"First off, I want to apologize for posting here so often. I don't have anywhere else to turn to. I recently contacted my abuser. I don't know why, I think it's part of my self destructive behavior. And I've realized something.",1,"the narrative shows signs of stress through the author's apology for frequent posting, indicating a sense of guilt or burden on others. the mention of having no other place to turn suggests isolation and lack of support, common in stressed individuals. contacting an abuser reflects self-destructive tendencies, a coping mechanism often linked to unresolved trauma and heightened stress. the admission of not understanding their own actions highlights confusion and internal conflict, further underscoring the psychological turmoil typically associated with stress."
"So I'm feeling a bit lost with this. I've had asthma ever since I was a little kid and it has been flaring up really bad over the last few weeks... I think. Actually I'm not sure if that's what it really is. I recently got a prescription for trazodone (about six weeks ago), and it has helped with having fewer nightmares.",0,"the narrative reflects a person discussing their health issues, specifically asthma and a recent prescription for trazodone. while they mention feeling a bit lost, which might suggest some confusion or uncertainty, there is no significant indication of stress. the individual talks about the effectiveness of trazodone in reducing nightmares, which implies some level of relief and improvement in their condition. the tone is more observational and factual rather than emotionally charged or overwhelmed. the focus on physical health and medication, without expressions of distress or anxiety, supports the classification that this person is not currently experiencing significant stress."
"The thought of helping people, curing diseases and caring for someone makes me happy. Imagine a person who’s an asshole but need help on health, I would help him/her. However, I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it. The problem with me is I know I can do for the meantime this job but it was a mistaken path, I could have done dev since it involves little customer interaction. I felt helpless because I need the money but feels like I am fooling myself to work my ass up for something that is not my passion.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators. the individual expresses a deep desire to help others and a passion for the medical field, which is a positive aspect of their life. however, this is overshadowed by their current job situation, which causes them considerable anxiety and physical symptoms like reflux. the stress is further compounded by a sense of helplessness and regret about their career path, as they feel trapped in a job that does not align with their passion and involves aspects they find distressing, such as customer interaction. the tension between their aspirations and their current reality, along with the physical manifestations of stress, are clear indicators of their distressed state."
"My ex thought that show was terrific inspiration. He used it to discuss “what if”s with his guy friends, who I hope had no idea how real he is about that shit. I called it “The Rape Along/Beat Along Show” for the longest time. I still do when Gramma isn’t listening. Last time I unexpectedly came across the DVD set (Grampy accidentally left it at my place on the kitchen table, and, yes, he’d been told not to leave it where I might see it)...",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of detachment and dark humor when discussing the ex's fascination with a particular show. the use of sarcastic and dismissive language, such as calling it the ""rape along/beat along show,"" suggests a coping mechanism rather than an expression of acute stress. the narrator's ability to joke about the situation, even with a certain level of cynicism, indicates a level of emotional distance from the distressing content. additionally, the mention of ""gramma"" and ""grampy"" introduces a familial context that appears more casual and less intense. while the subject matter of the show and the ex's behavior could be concerning, the overall tone and approach to recounting these events lack the immediacy and emotional intensity typically associated with someone experiencing high levels of stress."
"I don’t post very often and I’m on mobile so apologies for formatting errors etc I’ll try to make this easy to read! Background: I’ve been struggling with alcohol abuse and I’m currently 4 months sober (yay!). The first month without alcohol my withdrawals were intense. I became so angry, my anxiety was off the charts and I couldn’t focus on anything at hand.

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns.

"No criminal record, he’s not on any list, he changed his name and moved to a new town and no one there knows what he did and he’s been messaging her. I feel so hopeless. How am I supposed to feel safe? Or be able to sleep? He’s out there, consequence free, feeling safe enough to message her.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of anxiety and distress, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses feelings of hopelessness and fear for their safety, as well as concerns about their ability to sleep. these emotions are typically associated with stress, especially when they arise from a perceived threat or unresolved issue. the mention of someone changing their name and moving to a new town, combined with the fact that they are messaging someone, suggests a situation that feels out of control and threatening to the narrator. the sense of injustice and the idea that the person causing the distress is living ""consequence free"" further amplify the narrator's stress, as they struggle with feelings of powerlessness and a lack of safety."

TL;DR: I'm homeschooled lonely and can't join a sports team how do I make friends.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes a significant disruption in their routine due to health issues, leading to missed school and a transition to homeschooling. the mention of not having friends at public school and now spending all day at home highlights a sense of isolation and loneliness. the inability to join sports teams due to health constraints and the necessity of a car in their town further limits their social interactions and mobility. these factors collectively contribute to feelings of social isolation and a desire for face-to-face interaction, which are typical indicators of stress. the narrative's tone reflects a sense of yearning for connection and a struggle to find ways to socialize, underscoring the psychological impact of their current situation."
So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night.

Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1,"the narrative reflects a person who has been dealing with significant psychological stress related to past trauma. the mention of ptsd from an abusive relationship highlights a history of severe stress and emotional pain. despite making progress through therapy and emdr, the individual still experiences flashbacks, indicating unresolved trauma. the move to a different state to avoid triggers and the subsequent period without flashbacks suggest efforts to manage stress effectively. however, the recent flashback triggered by a social situation and alcohol consumption reveals underlying vulnerabilities. the sudden shift from enjoyment to panic and the inability to control emotions are clear indicators of stress and anxiety. these aspects, combined with the ongoing impact of past trauma, illustrate the person's continued struggle with stress."
After the 6 months we moved to a really big house the next town over. It was 3 times the size of the one that burned down. My mom got fired though from nursing because she was caught stealing drugs.

And it’s okay to fall down and have a bad day- as long as you pick yourself up and continue working toward moving forward.

Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving multiple individuals and their interactions, but it lacks the hallmarks of stress. the author recounts the comments received about getting b to attend counseling for self-esteem, and mentions k's involvement in an online role-playing relationship. despite the complexity of the relationships and the involvement of others, the tone remains factual and detached. there is no indication of emotional turmoil, anxiety, or overwhelming concern typically associated with stress. the author seems more focused on describing the situation rather than expressing personal distress or emotional strain. the mention of knowing b since high school further suggests a long-term, stable relationship, which does not imply immediate stress. overall, the narrative is presented in a calm and matter-of-fact manner, indicative of a non-stressed state."
"throwaway... sorry if this all sounds very messy. I have a history of child sexual abuse, rape in a past relationship and problems with dissociation.

I had won protection from them by giving them drugs.",0,"the narrative describes a prison environment where the individual is involved in gang activities and weapon-making. despite the high-stress setting, the person appears to be navigating the situation with a sense of control and strategic planning. they are aware of their impending release and are managing their interactions and actions to maintain their safety and position within the prison hierarchy. the detailed recounting of events, such as keeping watch and securing protection through drug trade, suggests a calculated and composed approach rather than one driven by stress or anxiety. the individual's ability to act strategically and maintain a facade about their release date further indicates a level of emotional regulation and situational awareness that is not typical of someone under significant stress."
"two months off of work in my favorite city with limitless money and i am more infuriated than ever. all its done is remove my dissociation and now i have inexplicable rage. i just fucking hate everything. i hate this site, even, and made an ultimatum never to come back. but i have no fucking idea what even to do.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional turmoil and frustration, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses a sense of anger and dissatisfaction despite having favorable circumstances such as time off work, being in a favorite city, and having limitless money. the mention of ""inexplicable rage"" and ""fucking hate everything"" suggests intense negative emotions that are not typical of someone experiencing relaxation or contentment. the ultimatum to avoid the site and the feeling of being lost without direction further indicate a deep-seated distress and a struggle to find peace or purpose. these elements collectively point to a state of significant psychological stress."
"And whose fault is that, then? My question to you; is it the tree’s fault that it never bothered to put in the effort to correct itself, or the hypothetical forest’s? Is it anyone’s fault at all? Could the tree ever be quite corrected, or was it destined to live out its life, becoming more and more crooked with each fucking day? I’m done.",0,"the narrative reflects a contemplative and somewhat philosophical tone, exploring themes of blame, effort, and destiny. the questions posed about fault and correction suggest a deep engagement with existential thoughts rather than an immediate expression of personal distress. the use of metaphorical language, such as comparing oneself to a tree in a forest, indicates a reflective state of mind rather than a stressed one. the closing statement, ""im done,"" while potentially interpreted as frustration, aligns more with a sense of conclusion to the thought process rather than an outburst of stress. overall, the narrative lacks direct indicators of stress, such as explicit mentions of overwhelming emotions, anxiety, or pressure, and instead leans towards a more analytical and philosophical examination of life circumstances."

Have you found anything that helps?",1,"the narrative reflects significant cognitive impairment and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the individual describes their cognitive processes as ""scrambled up and sluggish,"" suggesting a difficulty in maintaining mental clarity and focus. the mention of trouble with simple tasks like filling out forms or answering phone questions further highlights the impact on daily functioning. the stress is compounded by the context of being in the third year at a major university, a period typically associated with high academic pressure and expectations. the person's uncertainty about completing their education underscores the depth of their concern and stress. the plea for shared experiences and solutions indicates a sense of desperation and a search for support, both of which are typical responses to overwhelming stress. overall, the narrative's detailed depiction of cognitive difficulties and the emotional tone are clear indicators of stress."

Then tonight happened, the head of HR is severely worried for her safety (and my SOs) in a way he wasn't before. The head has called the Domestic Violence Hotline himself, and is looking for resources to help him solve this very delicate/tricky issue.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving concerns about insurance coverage, workplace disputes, and safety issues. it details interactions between an individual, their significant other (so), and the head of human resources (hr). despite the serious nature of the events, the tone of the narrative is relatively detached and factual. the writer provides a chronological account of events without expressing personal emotions or signs of distress. the focus is on reporting actions taken by others, such as the hr head calling the domestic violence hotline and seeking resources. this objective recounting, along with the absence of emotional language or personal stress indicators, suggests that the author is not experiencing significant stress themselves. instead, they are more concerned with the procedural aspects and the well-being of others involved."
"Should I just go ahead and get help? Am I worried about nothing? Is there a way to lose the worst bits of anxiety while keeping the bits that are perhaps somewhat helpful? Or have I got this all wrong and it's not anxiety (but perhaps something else) that makes me productive, etc? Or should I just accept all the awesome things in my life as a totally worthwhile price for feeling worried?",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, as evidenced by the writer's persistent questioning and self-doubt. the individual expresses uncertainty about whether to seek help, indicating an ongoing internal struggle. the mention of anxiety and the desire to eliminate its ""worst bits"" while retaining any perceived benefits suggests a complicated relationship with their emotional state. this ambivalence and the repeated questioning highlight a preoccupation with their mental well-being, which is a common sign of stress. additionally, the contemplation of whether anxiety or another factor is responsible for their productivity reflects a deeper concern about their ability to function effectively. the overall tone of the narrative, marked by worry and confusion, further supports the presence of stress."

I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the individual recounts a traumatic event that occurred a few years ago, suggesting the presence of lingering psychological effects. the fact that they are beginning to remember the incident again around the same time of year points to potential triggers and flashbacks, which are common in stress-related conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the description of hearing the sound at night and bursting into tears indicates a strong emotional response and difficulty managing distressing memories. the cyclical pattern of calming down and then crying again when hearing the sound reflects an ongoing struggle with emotional regulation. the individual's enjoyment of the release from crying and the guilt associated with it suggests a complex emotional response, potentially linked to their history of anxiety and mild depression. this complexity is further highlighted by their concern about seeking attention, which can be a sign of inner conflict and self-criticism often found in stressed individuals. overall, the narrative's content and emotional tone provide clear evidence of stress and its impact on the individual's mental health."

"This is an idea that my father also reinforced in me heavily. I remember vividly when I told him that everything was my fault (in my child mind obviously meaning ""you make everything my fault"" which was very much the state of things in the house growing up) and he straight up told me to stop fucking up so much if I didn't want things to be my fault (I should emphasize all ""fuck ups"" were minor- letting a pack of strawberries go to waste, forgetting to call him as soon as I left school, etc- but punished severely). Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim. I can't gauge conflict to save the life of me- even if I'm being an absolute ass, I'll feel like I'm the one who's being persecuted. My last relationship was a while ago, and lasted about a year.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep-seated sense of self-blame and guilt, which are common indicators of stress. the vivid memory of the father reinforcing the idea that everything was the narrator's fault suggests a long-term internalization of blame. the severe punishment for minor mistakes like letting strawberries go to waste or forgetting to call highlights an environment of high expectations and harsh consequences, contributing to chronic stress. the statement about feeling like a victim even when in the wrong points to a distorted perception of conflict and self-worth, likely stemming from past experiences of unfair treatment. the mention of difficulty gauging conflict and feeling persecuted even when behaving poorly indicates a persistent struggle with self-perception and interpersonal relationships, both of which are often affected by stress. the brief mention of a past relationship further suggests ongoing difficulties in maintaining personal connections, which can be both a cause and effect of stress. overall, the narrative's focus on self-blame, harsh punishment, and conflict misperception are clear indicators of an individual experiencing significant stress."

I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop.

I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and frustration. the writer expresses feelings of invalidation and misunderstanding, which are common indicators of stress. phrases like ""makes me feel like i am just pissing him off"" and ""my problem has suddenly become his"" highlight a sense of being a burden, which can exacerbate stress. the mention of a ""constant struggle and disability"" suggests ongoing challenges that contribute to a heightened stress level. the writer's acknowledgment that their brain ""works and processes things differently now and always will"" points to a deeper, possibly chronic issue that affects their mental state. finally, the feeling of isolation when communicating with the other person (""i just feel so very alone when i talk to him"") is a strong indicator of emotional strain and a lack of support, which are critical factors in experiencing stress."

">This put an end to his trips outside. He has now become a house cat, staying inside. Cats transfer FIV though deep bites from other cats with it, which means at least one of his siblings also has it. Ernie being FIV means that his body is not capable of fighting off diseases.

"i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does. but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them? why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull? why am i crying right now? i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author expresses confusion and fear despite recognizing support from others, which suggests an internal conflict and persistent anxiety. the mention of a ""pit in my stomach"" and thoughts ""clawing at the sides of my skull"" are vivid descriptions of physical and mental symptoms commonly associated with stress. the act of crying and feeling like an ""ungrateful prick"" further highlights the emotional turmoil and self-criticism that can accompany stress. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of distress and an ongoing struggle with managing their emotions."
"Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope? Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything. But when situations arise, especially with those I'm in a relationship with where I can't control the situation, my anxiety goes out of control so I end up lashing out in negative ways. If you have found you were controlling and were able to better yourself can you please direct me on where to turn to do the same?",1,"the narrative describes a person dealing with significant anxiety and its impact on their relationships. the individual mentions using control as a coping mechanism, which is a common response to anxiety. they highlight their struggle with situations that are beyond their control, leading to heightened anxiety and negative reactions. the discussion with their therapist and the realization of these patterns indicate ongoing stress. the plea for advice on how to manage and improve these behaviors further underscores their current struggle with stress. these elements are typical indicators of someone experiencing stress, as they involve efforts to manage overwhelming emotions and the impact on personal relationships."
"No, not really. I thanked my boyfriend, and then immediately blurted out ""how am I going to explain this to my mother?""

I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer. I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido. We ended up crying and cuddling each other.",0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional situation, but it does not exhibit the classic signs of significant stress. the author describes a conversation with their partner about potential sexual incompatibility and the impact on their relationship. despite the emotional weight of the discussion, the author approaches the situation with a problem-solving attitude, suggesting a potential medical intervention and offering support. the mention of crying and cuddling indicates a moment of vulnerability and connection rather than overwhelming stress. the author's willingness to give their partner space and their focus on a future medical appointment demonstrate a level of emotional regulation and optimism. these elements suggest that while the situation is challenging, it is being managed with a supportive and constructive approach, which is not typical of someone experiencing high levels of stress."

Student loans don't come in until January.",1,"the narrative describes multiple stress-inducing factors. the individual is dealing with the transition to college life, which is a significant change and often a source of stress. the urgency of moving out due to a volatile home situation adds to their emotional burden. financial struggles are evident, as they mention difficulties with finances, an impending phone bill, and the delay in receiving student loans. the recent acquisition of a job, coupled with their current illness and worry about starting work, further exacerbates their stress levels. the combination of academic pressures, financial instability, health issues, and the need to adapt to new responsibilities are clear indicators of stress in this narrative."

"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it. Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened. He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.",1,"the narrative exhibits clear indicators of stress, particularly through the discussion of struggling with ptsd and the need for emotional support during difficult moments. the writer expresses a desire for a partner who can be present and provide comfort during flashbacks and emotional breakdowns, which are common experiences for individuals with ptsd. the mention of needing someone who can handle conversations about past traumas without reacting aggressively or negatively highlights the stress the writer feels when their current partner responds with anger rather than support. this reaction from the partner exacerbates the writer's stress, as it shifts the focus from the writer's need for empathy to the partner's anger, creating an additional layer of emotional burden. the detailed recounting of these interactions and the specific emotional needs articulated by the writer are indicative of the stress they are experiencing in their current relationship and their struggle to find a supportive and understanding partner."

"I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"". She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and self-doubt, which are typical indicators of stress. the individual describes a scenario where they had certain expectations from a conversation, possibly with a therapist, and those expectations were not met. the disappointment is evident in the way they recount the response they received, ""i am not getting into this with you,"" which suggests a feeling of rejection or dismissal. the mention of feelings of inadequacy and the disbelief in the positive remarks about being interesting and nice further highlight a lack of self-esteem and pervasive negative self-perception. the skepticism towards the authenticity of the compliments indicates a possible pattern of distrust or difficulty in accepting positive feedback, which can be a significant source of stress. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that point towards an ongoing struggle with self-worth and unmet emotional needs, both of which are common in individuals experiencing stress."

Send good vibes please?",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress, beginning with the mention of partial hospitalization and a diagnosis of ptsd related to multiple traumas, including childhood sexual assault. the writer's request for a meeting with upper management to establish clear boundaries at work suggests a significant effort to regain control and ensure a safer environment, which is a common response to trauma. the statement about feeling like they are going to throw up indicates acute anxiety and physical symptoms of stress as the meeting approaches. the plea for good vibes further emphasizes the writer's need for support and reassurance during this challenging time. these elements collectively illustrate a high level of stress and anxiety stemming from both past traumatic experiences and the anticipation of the upcoming meeting."
"I was in a relationship, so I didn't really let it go anywhere, but hell, it was a new experience for me, and I liked being liked. Fast forward half a year to my breakup.

It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.

All-in-all, I like this guy, he's been an OK manager to me, I've gotten all of my raises since I've been under him, he has kids, so he understands me as a parent, etc. Am I making too big of a deal out of this? I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth. Your thoughts?",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is contemplating a situation involving their manager but does not exhibit clear signs of stress. the tone is relatively calm and reflective, as the individual weighs the pros and cons of their manager's behavior and their own position within the team. they express gratitude for their manager's support and acknowledge the positive aspects of their relationship, such as receiving raises and understanding as a parent. the mention of considering hr shows a thoughtful approach to conflict resolution rather than an immediate, stress-driven reaction. the narrative lacks urgent or intense emotional language, which would typically indicate stress, and instead shows a measured consideration of the situation and its potential implications."

"She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?",1,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with emotional turmoil and self-doubt, which are classic indicators of stress. the person is struggling with unreciprocated romantic feelings towards a friend, leading to a conflict between their desires and the reality of the situation. the mention of feeling ""pathetic"" and the impact on their self-esteem highlight significant emotional distress. the internal debate about whether to continue pursuing a romantic future or to distance themselves for their own well-being indicates a high level of cognitive dissonance. this indecision and the accompanying emotional strain are typical of someone experiencing stress. the narrative's focus on the difficulty of maintaining a friendship under these circumstances and the uncertainty about the other person's feelings further underscore the psychological tension and anxiety the individual is facing."

"It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened.

Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldn’t be a competition.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of significant stress and trauma. the author describes witnessing a deeply distressing event involving a close family member's attempted suicide and subsequent self-harm. this experience alone is a major source of psychological distress. the narrative also mentions the additional burden of not being believed by others, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and helplessness. the comments from others telling the author to be happy about the failed attempt show a lack of understanding and empathy, which can further deepen the sense of emotional pain and frustration. the mention of other abuse following this traumatic event indicates ongoing stressors that compound the initial trauma. the phrase ""trauma shouldn't be a competition"" reflects a profound sense of invalidation and a struggle with how others perceive and respond to their pain. all these elements combined highlight a narrative steeped in significant stress and emotional turmoil."

"I am so scared to go up to 10mg because I want to still be able to lose weight. My doc has suggested Prozac because it has had more success with weight loss than weight gain with majority of people.

Even though I KNOW it's anxiety, I can't break the loop of thoughts.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through several indicators. the author expresses fear and uncertainty about increasing medication dosage, which suggests anxiety about potential side effects, specifically weight gain. the mention of their doctor suggesting prozac highlights a concern with managing their mental health condition effectively while balancing other health goals. the statement about wanting to get off meds but experiencing recurring physical symptoms points to a struggle with ongoing health anxiety and hypochondria. this cyclical pattern of anxious thoughts that the author cannot break further underscores their high stress levels. the narrative is filled with worry, indecision, and a sense of being overwhelmed, all of which are classic signs of stress."
"I only have about $10 left in my bank account. My new job pays bi-weekly which means i'll be starving for about 3 weeks.

If you guys can help me I would gladly appreciate it!",0,"the narrative describes a financial struggle and concern about food scarcity due to the timing of the next paycheck. while these are challenging circumstances, the individual's tone remains pragmatic and solution-oriented. they mention a plan to visit the local food bank and are reaching out for help in a composed manner. this proactive approach and the absence of language indicating overwhelming anxiety or despair suggest resilience and a capacity to manage the situation. the narrative does not exhibit signs of emotional distress, such as panic, hopelessness, or pervasive negative thoughts, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it reflects a practical mindset focused on finding solutions."
"So many local counties and cities struggle with homelessness and put a lot of resources into fixing the problem. But I feel society as a whole needs to change in order to truly fix the problems at hand especially at the federal level. By at least having these conversations, we can start talking about how we as a nation might be able to change to help our neighbors. I hope this made a bit of sense. I have been up late and wanted to reflect on some of the previous conversations I have had with people trying to change the narrative on homelessness.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and reflective perspective on the issue of homelessness. the author discusses societal and federal-level changes needed to address the problem, indicating a broader, solution-oriented approach rather than a personal emotional response. the mention of being up late and reflecting on conversations suggests engagement and concern but not necessarily stress. the focus on collective efforts and dialogue about societal change shows a level-headed consideration of the issue rather than an immediate, stress-driven reaction. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of personal distress or overwhelming anxiety, such as expressions of hopelessness, frustration, or emotional exhaustion. instead, it presents a rational and composed viewpoint on a complex social issue."

I’m like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape. I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as the author's description of fluctuating emotional states, including sadness, anger, and irritability. the mention of being thrown into an episode of depression after watching a television show suggests heightened sensitivity to external stimuli, which is a common symptom of stress-related disorders. the individual also expresses a lack of understanding of their symptoms and triggers, indicating a sense of confusion and lack of control over their emotional state. the metaphor of being ""like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape"" vividly conveys a fragile sense of self, struggling to maintain coherence. furthermore, the preference for being labeled with other severe diagnoses over ptsd underscores a deep-seated struggle with self-identity and acceptance of their condition. these elements collectively point to significant psychological distress and an ongoing battle with stress and trauma."
"This is all relevant because I'm slowly realizing that **keeping my relationship from my mother isn't sustainable**. I'm not a good liar.

Being a narcisist, she can't stand when I give anyone more attention or devotion than her.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly in the context of familial and romantic relationships. the writer expresses a sense of unsustainability in their current situation, indicating a persistent and unresolved issue that is weighing heavily on their mind. the admission of being a poor liar and the inevitability of the truth coming out highlights a significant internal conflict and fear of confrontation. the mention of the mother being a narcissist who would hate the boyfriend adds a layer of emotional turmoil and anticipatory anxiety. these elements collectively point to the writer experiencing stress due to the pressure of maintaining secrecy, fear of negative reactions, and the struggle to balance relationships with conflicting demands."
"Thank you for reading and for your time. Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her. I never snuck out, never got in trouble at school, no drugs, no drinking, no bad friends, tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for, and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day. My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted. Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the writer's detailed account of their upbringing. the description of being terrified of their mother and the extensive efforts to avoid any behavior that might provoke her indicate a high level of anxiety and fear. the writer's adherence to strict self-discipline, such as avoiding trouble, maintaining good grades, and abstaining from negative influences, suggests a constant state of vigilance and pressure to meet certain standards. the mention of siblings who were spoiled and manipulative adds to the sense of unfairness and isolation. the most telling detail is the mother's unpredictable and harsh physical punishment, which would understandably create a chronic state of stress and fear. these elements collectively paint a picture of a stressful and oppressive environment that has deeply affected the individual's mental state."

Some of my earliest memories are of the towers falling.,0,"the narrative reflects a significant historical event and its impact on the author's early life, but it lacks direct expressions of current emotional distress or stress indicators. while the author recounts a traumatic event and its aftermath, the description is more factual and retrospective rather than indicative of present turmoil. there is no mention of ongoing anxiety, depression, or other symptoms typically associated with stress. the focus is on the memory of the event and the role of the author's mother rather than on personal feelings of stress or current struggles. this suggests a more detached and observational recounting rather than an expression of current stress."
"Hi, I will not have a home in a few weeks . I'm living with an abusive, drug addict roommate whom has constantly stolen from me. I have asked cops etc to help and I'm told restraining order.

I'm mentally and physically exhausted, but I know I cannot endure this.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, both in content and tone. the author mentions an imminent loss of their home, which is a major life stressor. living with an abusive, drug-addicted roommate who has stolen from them adds layers of chronic stress and fear for personal safety. the involvement of law enforcement and the suggestion of a restraining order indicate the severity of the situation. phrases like ""mentally and physically exhausted"" and ""i cannot endure this"" are direct expressions of overwhelming stress and fatigue. the combination of immediate housing insecurity, ongoing abusive interactions, and feelings of helplessness are all clear markers of a high-stress situation."

I get extremely anxious knowing I’m going to have to work the next day. I am losing so much sleep, even now when I’m writing this, I haven’t touched my phone in a few hours but my mind wouldn’t stop rambling, making me feel horrible. It’s 1:33 am and I still can’t sleep.",1,"the narrative reflects several clear indicators of stress. the author mentions feeling immense pressure and constant sweating during work, which are physical symptoms often associated with stress and anxiety. the unexpected fear of human interaction, despite not having had it before, suggests a situational anxiety triggered by the new job environment. the extreme anxiety about going to work the next day highlights anticipatory stress, which can significantly impact mental well-being. the loss of sleep and the restless mind that won't stop rambling are classic signs of stress-induced insomnia. these symptoms collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant stress, struggling to cope with the demands and pressures of their new job."
"how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you? did you do something wrong?"". The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else). To this day, they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts (apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible) and because of bureaucratic issues, the man has not been taken to questioning. My mother helped me tremendously by arranging the divorce for me, and in the divorce, we did not put any alimony.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, evident through the description of a violent incident and the subsequent lack of resolution. the mention of being punched while driving suggests a traumatic experience, which is a common source of stress. the narrative also highlights feelings of helplessness and frustration with the police response, emphasizing bureaucratic hurdles that prevent justice. this ongoing lack of closure can exacerbate stress. additionally, the involvement of the mother in arranging a divorce indicates a major life change, which is another stressor. the absence of alimony in the divorce settlement might imply financial concerns, adding another layer of stress. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of stress, including trauma, frustration with authorities, significant life changes, and potential financial worries."
"I have therapy, I'm on medication. It's so hard to just get through a week without thinking of him and now I can't stop picturing his stupid face.

I'm so shaken up over this.",1,"the narrative indicates significant emotional distress and signs of stress. the individual mentions being in therapy and on medication, which suggests ongoing mental health treatment, often indicative of underlying stress or anxiety issues. the statement about struggling to get through a week without thinking of someone and the vivid imagery of not being able to stop picturing his face points to intrusive thoughts, a common symptom of stress. the desire to crawl into a hole and cry and scream reflects a strong emotional response and a sense of being overwhelmed. the added frustration of not being able to see their therapist due to a holiday exacerbates their distress, highlighting the importance of their support system in managing their mental health. the phrase ""i am so shaken up over this"" further emphasizes the intense emotional turmoil they are experiencing. all these elements together point to a narrative filled with stress indicators."
"The backpack had my social security card, passport, birth certificate, laptop, notebooks, and other important legal documents like my last lease agreement. I am on the street because my landlord in San Diego was making violent threats towards me and I had to flee. Police were called, and nothing was done. I moved to California a few years ago. I left my things with some people I trusted and they all stole them and sold them for money.",1,"the narrative describes a series of distressing and traumatic events, which are clear indicators of stress. the loss of critical personal items such as a social security card, passport, birth certificate, and laptop, coupled with important legal documents, would naturally induce significant anxiety and a sense of vulnerability. being forced to leave one's home due to violent threats from a landlord adds a layer of acute stress, especially when compounded by the lack of police intervention. the individual's displacement and the betrayal by trusted people who stole and sold their belongings exacerbate feelings of helplessness and distrust. these elements collectively highlight a situation marked by insecurity, fear, and a profound sense of loss, all of which are hallmark indicators of a high-stress experience."

Little did he know she was already taken by him.",0,"the narrative describes a moment of youthful romance and connection, emphasizing positive emotions and hopeful outlooks. the characters are depicted experiencing mutual attraction and excitement, which are not typical indicators of stress. the boy's efforts to impress the girl and her sweet smile contribute to an overall tone of optimism and happiness. the narrative lacks elements such as anxiety, worry, or tension that are commonly associated with stress. instead, it focuses on the joy and potential of a budding relationship, which aligns with a non-stressed state of mind."
"I have a dog that I got during the abusive relationship that led to my PTSD, though I could never prove it there were obvious signs that she was abused by my ex as well. She has always been very sensitive to how people are feeling and acting (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she will curl up by my stomach and won't leave my side) could this be a starting point for me to train her to recognise when I have a major panic attack and just lay with me until it passes? I was going to find a dog training sub to post this on but some of you may have service dogs for your PTSD so I wanted to get your opinion as well!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep concern for the well-being of both the author and their dog, with a particular focus on the dog’s sensitivity to emotional and physical states. the mention of ptsd and past abusive relationships indicates a history of trauma, but the narrative itself is centered on a proactive approach to managing potential panic attacks. the author expresses a desire to train their dog to assist during these episodes, which shows forward-thinking and problem-solving behavior. this approach, along with seeking advice from a community that may have similar experiences, suggests a level of control and planning that is not typically associated with acute stress. the narrative is more about finding solutions and utilizing existing support systems rather than expressing immediate distress or helplessness."
"I'm in a well paid job. I have beautiful friends, and most of the best ones are women. I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel safe, have come to terms with the past, am able to give time and money to help others. And yet despite all these blessings I've been paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work. By a lie.",1,"the narrative begins by highlighting several positive aspects of the individual's life, such as a well-paid job, beautiful friends, and a sense of safety and contentment with the past. these elements suggest a stable and fulfilling life. however, the sudden shift in tone occurs with the mention of being ""paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work,"" which indicates a significant disruption in their mental state. the phrase ""by a lie"" introduces a specific source of distress that is powerful enough to incapacitate the individual despite their otherwise positive circumstances. this juxtaposition of external success and internal turmoil is a strong indicator of stress. the inability to function at work suggests that the stress is severe and pervasive, impacting daily responsibilities and overall well-being. this narrative exemplifies how stress can manifest even in the presence of outwardly favorable conditions, highlighting the profound effect that internal conflicts or external deceptions can have on mental health."
"I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years. We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child. Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town). I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of. The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.",0,"the narrative describes a generally positive and stable relationship with a partner, highlighting a cherished and loved child. despite mentioning past conflicts, the author reflects on these incidents with a sense of resolution and a focus on the positive aspects of their current life. the use of words like ""elated"" and ""beautiful bubble of love"" suggests a state of contentment and happiness. there is an absence of language indicating ongoing distress or anxiety, and the overall tone reflects satisfaction with the present situation. this suggests that the author is not currently experiencing significant stress."
"I know this will prob get doe vote to oblivion but every time i see this phrase it just feels so negative. Anxiety can be cured, you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway. People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a day to day basis it's just it comes naturally to them without even noticing, that's the point we need to get ourselves back to in order to be cured. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that feels de-motivated when they see this phrase so maybe use it less on here guys?",0,"the narrative expresses a thoughtful and reasoned perspective on managing anxiety. the author discusses the idea that anxiety can be cured or managed effectively, drawing comparisons to how people without anxiety handle fear and stress naturally. the tone is constructive and focuses on solutions, indicating a sense of hope and motivation. the suggestion to use certain phrases less frequently to avoid demotivation shows a concern for the well-being of others, reflecting empathy and a proactive attitude. these elements suggest a mindset that is not overwhelmed by stress but rather engaged in finding and advocating for positive strategies."
"Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok. I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life. I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave. And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive? My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and psychological strain. the individual expresses uncertainty about the seriousness of their breakup, which suggests ongoing relational tension and confusion. the statement about being tired of mistreatment by everyone indicates pervasive feelings of being undervalued and unsupported. the declaration of not being strong enough to care for oneself or to leave highlights a sense of helplessness and low self-efficacy. the inability to work or answer phone calls due to anxiety points to severe functional impairment, a common symptom of high stress levels. the mention of a lack of understanding and support from family exacerbates the individual's isolation and sense of hopelessness. these elements collectively indicate a high level of stress and emotional burden."
"At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts. This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship. Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years. Yes, they somehow remained ""friends"" for years after this affair. The next stab came when I was sent to an Air Force base for a 3 month training for my job.",0,"the narrative describes a distressing situation involving stalking, threats, and manipulation, which are typically indicative of a highly stressful environment. however, the focus is on recounting events rather than expressing personal emotional turmoil or stress. the narrator maintains a detached tone, providing a chronological account of the events without delving into their own emotional responses or stress levels. this lack of personal emotional expression, despite the disturbing nature of the events, suggests a level of emotional distance or coping that might not align with typical stress indicators. the narrative's structure and content focus more on the external events and less on internal emotional experiences, which can be relevant in understanding why it may not be classified as reflecting personal stress."
"It would help so much if I could use my car and not worry about the insurance etc. It would be a huge help! I would also paint a picture for the person who helps, as I am an avid painter. I just want to get this done as food and everything like those necessities is taken care of, but I don't have the funds to get this done before the 7th. If you can help, it would be appreciated so much!",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is experiencing a practical challenge related to car insurance, but there is no indication of significant emotional distress. the individual expresses a clear desire to resolve the issue and offers a painting in return, which suggests a solution-oriented mindset. the mention of food and other necessities being taken care of indicates that their basic needs are met, reducing the likelihood of stress related to survival concerns. overall, the tone is one of seeking assistance rather than expressing anxiety or overwhelming stress. the structured and composed nature of the request, along with the absence of emotional language or signs of distress, aligns with a non-stressed state."
My family thought it was a home invasion so the retrieved their guns and prepair to defend them selves. After the authorities knocked the door down they then announced them selves and threatened to kill everyone inside. My family dropped their guns and surrender peacefully.

He was not allowed to speak or talk to my parents.,0,"the narrative describes a highly intense and traumatic event involving a home invasion by authorities, which led to a significant amount of fear and confusion. despite the chaos, the family managed to comply peacefully when the authorities made their presence known. the description of the authorities threatening to kill everyone inside and the subsequent ransacking of the house would typically be associated with high levels of stress. however, the narrative's tone remains relatively calm and factual, focusing on the sequence of events rather than expressing personal distress or emotional turmoil. the lack of emotive language or personal reflection on the incident suggests a detachment from the experience, which is not typical of someone under significant stress. the description of the brother's arrest and the inability to communicate with parents is mentioned without an evident emotional response, further indicating a level of emotional detachment or resilience in the face of potentially stressful circumstances."
"I feel like I have no personality or sense of self, and my mind will take sudden turns every week or so. I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly, because my whole set of core values, ideas and principles changes constantly. And I've seen people saying that it's normal. I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly, because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week, and it's disturbing. Actually, there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different, like something changed everything about me overnight.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of instability and lack of a consistent self-identity, which are strong indicators of psychological distress. the writer expresses confusion and disturbance over their rapidly changing interests, values, and principles, highlighting an unpredictable and unsettling internal experience. this sudden shift in personality and the inability to maintain a stable sense of self can be incredibly stressful, as it disrupts one's understanding of their own identity and can lead to feelings of alienation and anxiety. the mention of waking up feeling completely different overnight further underscores the depth of their distress, as it suggests a loss of control over their own mental state. such experiences are not typically considered normal and can be indicative of underlying psychological issues that contribute to significant stress."
"I saw a shadow figure standing in my bedroom door... so I'm camped out in my mom's room. I have bipolar I as well, so it's likely that's the cause of the hallucinations. &#x200B; I can't take this. I've had several anxiety attacks in the last few weeks; twice, I was sent home from work about half an hour early.",1,"the narrative describes experiencing a shadow figure hallucination, which is a strong indicator of psychological distress. the individual mentions having bipolar i, a condition often associated with severe mood swings and potential psychotic features like hallucinations. the statement ""i cannot take this"" conveys a sense of overwhelming stress and helplessness. frequent anxiety attacks and being sent home from work early further underscore the impact of stress on their daily functioning. these elements collectively suggest significant emotional and psychological strain, consistent with stress-related symptoms."
"I have been always told that I was a burden, a waste of space and that I was a fuck up even tho I'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. I'll most likely end up homeless as I can't even work as I have little work experience and I try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. My friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while I'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. I don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. My friends constantly remark about me being a mess.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as feelings of worthlessness and self-deprecation, highlighted by the individual's perception of being a burden and a failure despite their academic achievements. the reference to panic attacks and subsequent job loss indicates acute anxiety, a common stress response. the comparison to friends who are perceived as more successful exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and social isolation. the lack of social interaction and negative reinforcement from parents further contribute to a sense of hopelessness and low self-esteem. these elements collectively illustrate a high level of psychological distress, characteristic of someone experiencing significant stress."
"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her. So I'm writing this in the parking lot of my college afraid to go home. Awesome",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through the individual's expression of fear and anxiety about returning home. the mention of potential false accusations and past incidents involving the police indicates a high level of distrust and concern for personal safety. the writer's choice to remain in the parking lot rather than face the situation at home underscores the avoidance behavior commonly associated with stress. the phrase ""afraid to go home"" is a direct indicator of the emotional turmoil and apprehension experienced by the individual. the use of the word ""awesome"" at the end, likely intended sarcastically, further highlights the distress and frustration underlying the narrative. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress."
"My heart races and palpitates. I've gone on autopilot, but I've never experienced anything like an out of body experience.

"Already borrowed what I can from family and friends, living on my own, and rather exhausted that. I'd rather not share my specific adress in public, so PM if you want to help. Got no preferences, but a kebab or pizza with varied stuff in it would be great for nutrition. Hate asking for this, but I'm at a low point and getting rather desperate. If ordering isn't the thing for you, a small amount of money to buy something cheap at the store is just as good.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress, which are evident through the expressions of desperation and the situation described. the individual mentions having exhausted resources from family and friends, indicating a lack of support system and financial strain. living on their own adds to the isolation and responsibility, further compounding their stress. the reluctance to share their address publicly suggests a concern for privacy and possibly safety, which can be common in stressed individuals who feel vulnerable. the mention of specific food preferences for nutrition highlights a basic need for sustenance, emphasizing their dire situation. the admission of being at a low point and feeling desperate underscores the emotional and psychological burden they are experiencing. all these elements together paint a picture of someone under significant stress, struggling to meet basic needs and seeking help in a manner that reflects their distress and urgency."
"Every minor detail feels just so overwhelming that I feel suffocated and panicky all the time. I imagine others here have gone through something similar, so I wanted to ask about your experience with grad school applications. How did you survive? How did you preserve your mental health, and do the best that you could? Thanks so much.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress as evidenced by the individual's description of feeling overwhelmed and suffocated by minor details. these expressions suggest a significant emotional burden and a sense of panic, which are common symptoms of stress. the author’s inquiry about others' experiences with grad school applications and their strategies for maintaining mental health further indicates a search for coping mechanisms, a typical behavior in stressed individuals seeking reassurance and support. the urgency in their questions about survival and mental health preservation underscores their current struggle and the need for practical advice to manage their situation. these elements collectively highlight the presence of stress in the individual's narrative."
"I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself, and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.",1,"the narrative reflects a period of significant distress and anxiety, indicated by the individual's description of being a shut-in and experiencing panic attacks. the avoidance of social situations and the severe anxiety suggest a high level of stress. the mention of not seeking medical help for anxiety further underscores the struggle with mental health. the transition to a demanding job with poor working conditions also implies a stressful environment, despite the positive life lessons gained. the narrative shows a journey through stress and anxiety, marked by efforts to cope and improve through education and self-improvement, but the initial indicators of stress are evident in the described experiences and emotional responses."
"She'll order so much food, and binges on it, while downing shots the whole time. The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her. It's like I'm binging too. She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging. The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving another person's disordered eating and manipulative behavior around food and alcohol. while the narrator expresses discomfort and a change in their own habits when with this person, they also show signs of setting boundaries, such as refusing to pay for excessive food and declining to do shots. the ability to assert oneself and recognize manipulative tactics suggests a level of self-awareness and control that is not typically associated with high stress. the focus is more on the friend's behavior rather than an internal struggle or emotional turmoil of the narrator, which aligns with a non-stressed state."
"Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me]. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once, the wood splintered and went into my back. Still no-one stopped him.",1,"the narrative reveals a deeply distressing and traumatic experience, characterized by physical violence and a lack of protection. the writer describes episodes of being physically assaulted by their brother, which led to intense pain and fear, compelling them to seek help from their mother while she was at work. the detail of leaning against the bedroom door with all their weight to prevent further harm, only to have the door splinter and injure them, highlights a sense of helplessness and desperation. the absence of intervention or protection from these violent encounters further exacerbates the feelings of isolation and vulnerability. these elements—chronic exposure to violence, lack of safety, and emotional distress—are significant indicators of stress and trauma."
I have had two or three or more reoccurring dreams of me cheating on my boyfriend.. and they are so real that I actually feel awful when I wake up or like it actually happened.

Recently me and my boyfriend had been going through a tough stage and I've been carrying a huge amount of guilt and I've been feeling like I'm not a good person at all...,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the recurring dreams of infidelity suggest significant anxiety and internal conflict, as dreams often reflect unresolved issues or fears. the vividness and emotional impact of these dreams, causing the individual to feel awful upon waking, indicate that these concerns are deeply affecting their mental state. the mention of waking up spooked and feeling as though the events actually happened further underscores the intensity of the distress. the relationship context provided, including the recent tough stage and the substantial guilt the individual feels, highlights a source of ongoing emotional turmoil. the self-perception of not being a good person suggests a negative self-assessment, which is commonly associated with stress and low self-esteem. these elements combined paint a picture of someone grappling with significant emotional and psychological stress."
"While my friends and myself included, have high hopes that this will work out, I’m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table. I’m going to be so damn vulnerable. While he’s expressed and shown signs that he’s just as into this as I am, if not more so, I’ve also never done this before. I’ve only been in 1 (college) relationship before this, followed by 3 years of singleness and ultimate casual fuckery. I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.",1,"the narrative reveals a high level of anxiety and apprehension about entering a new relationship. the individual expresses fear of vulnerability and the potential emotional risk involved, which are clear indicators of stress. the mention of being ""petrified"" and ""so damn vulnerable"" underscores the intensity of these emotions. the context of having limited prior relationship experience and a significant period of singleness adds to the uncertainty and stress. the narrative also reflects a strong internal conflict between hope and fear, with the person acknowledging their deep feelings and the importance of fighting for the relationship despite their fears. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress."
"That’s it for me. Bye, world. I run and hide inside a key repairs store. The shop attendant give me a worried look. I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1,"the narrative reflects a state of acute distress and possible hopelessness, as evidenced by the phrase ""bye, world,"" which suggests a desire to escape or withdraw from life. the individual's actions, such as running and hiding in a key repairs store, indicate a sense of urgency and desperation. the worried look from the shop attendant underscores the unusual and alarming nature of the behavior. the inability to move, despite being aware of standing in the door, points to a physical manifestation of stress, possibly a freeze response, which is a common reaction to overwhelming situations. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing significant stress, characterized by feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and disconnection from their surroundings."
"Everything was absolutely perfect. He is always very quiet, but is a complete sweetheart, and very warm and kind once he trusts someone. He’s pretty much the spitting image of what I imagined of the person I would marry when I was young. The one thing about him that would have seemed “off” is that he never really talked at all about his life before the Army. I know what city he is from, and a couple inconsequential details, but nothing significant.",0,"the narrative describes a positive and affectionate relationship, highlighting qualities like warmth, kindness, and trust. the author expresses satisfaction and admiration, noting that their partner matches their ideal vision of a spouse. while there is a mention of the partner's reticence about their past, this detail is presented as a minor curiosity rather than a source of concern or distress. the overall tone is calm and content, with no evident signs of anxiety, worry, or emotional turmoil. such indicators are typically absent in narratives from individuals experiencing stress, supporting the assessment that the author is not under significant stress."
So i was run off the road and needed to repair my car. Took it in and it ended up costing me $600 AU. im just asking for help any amount of money is appreciated.

Do I force myself to move forward? Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd? I feel like they’re so out of line. I’m all over the place. Just someone please help.,1,"the narrative exhibits clear indicators of stress, primarily reflected in the individual's expressions of confusion and desperation. the questions posed about forcing oneself to move forward and concerns about ptsd suggest an ongoing struggle with past trauma, which is a significant source of stress. the feeling of being ""all over the place"" further highlights a sense of disorganization and overwhelm, common in individuals experiencing high stress levels. the plea for help underscores the urgency and intensity of the emotional distress. these elements collectively point to a person grappling with significant psychological strain."
"&#x200B; Hey everyone, Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with insurance adjusters and etc.",1,"the narrative recounts a personal experience with hurricane florence, highlighting the evacuation of family members, rescue operations due to severe flooding, and the emotional toll of returning to damaged homes. the mention of family members being displaced and still in recovery stages indicates ongoing distress and instability. the need to find resources and deal with insurance adjusters adds to the stress, reflecting a situation filled with uncertainty and emotional upheaval. these elements are typical indicators of stress as they involve significant life disruptions, emotional trauma, and continuous challenges in coping with the aftermath of a natural disaster."
As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as experiencing a total burnout and dealing with an abusive situation. the individual mentions feeling retraumatized when discussing their experiences, which is a common reaction among those who have endured significant trauma. the difficulty in sharing their story due to others' overwhelming reactions or disbelief adds to their sense of isolation and distress. the friend's dismissive response, comparing their situation to others' problems, likely exacerbates feelings of invalidation and helplessness. these elements collectively point to a high level of emotional strain and psychological burden typical of someone under considerable stress."
"When we returned we discovered that one of our beloved pets' health had taken a turn for the worse and we had to them euthanized, so that was a setback. We still have not been able to pay rent for May. Our landlords are trying to work with us but I believe they are becoming impatient, also since the 5th there is an additional $5 owed for every day that it is late so the amount is growing. We are also still very behind in our utility bills. I was able to negotiate something with the company that I finance my car through so that it would be easier to make the payments but could still use some help paying my insurance this month before it is cancelled again (It was cancelled briefly in April but I was able to get it reinstated).",1,"the narrative describes multiple significant stressors that the individual is currently facing. the mention of the pet's health deteriorating and the subsequent euthanasia indicates a recent emotional trauma and loss. financial difficulties are a recurring theme, with the inability to pay rent on time, accruing late fees, and struggling to keep up with utility bills, all contributing to a heightened sense of pressure and urgency. the individual's efforts to negotiate with the car financing company highlight a proactive but stressed attempt to manage their obligations, while the mention of insurance cancellation adds another layer of concern and instability. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress, as the individual is dealing with compounded emotional and financial burdens."
My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me. A few days ago she asked if her and my nephew can come spend next Monday - Friday with me because her BF is going out of town and she doesn't want to be in the house alone without him (they live with his family so I guess sometimes it gets uncomfortable). I said okay sure. I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed. I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is accommodating their sister and nephew due to the sister's discomfort staying alone while her boyfriend is out of town. despite the logistical challenge of hosting additional people in a small studio apartment, the writer's tone remains composed and practical. they provide a clear plan for how to manage the space and mention their long-term relationship with their boyfriend, indicating stability. the writer's approach to the situation is solution-oriented and lacks signs of emotional distress, such as anxiety or frustration. the detailed and organized manner in which they discuss the arrangements suggests they are managing the situation effectively without significant stress."
"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house. Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own. I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here. I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything. Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through several indicators. the strained relationship with the father and the necessity of cohabitation due to financial constraints contribute to a sense of entrapment. the individual's self-description as ""pathetic, weak, and incapable"" highlights a deep-seated negative self-perception, which is a common symptom of stress and possibly low self-esteem. the feeling of being stuck and unable to progress, despite efforts to move forward, suggests a sense of helplessness and frustration. these emotions are typical of someone experiencing chronic stress, as they often feel overwhelmed by their circumstances and perceive their efforts as futile."
There is a waitlist to be called when they become available. I do not want to start training an adult dog from the shelter to become a service dog. I think there is too much room for error if I'm not the one who socialized the dog from the beginning. Any advice or notes from those who have them would be great. Thanks.,0,"the narrative reflects a concern about the potential challenges of training an adult dog from a shelter to become a service dog. the individual expresses a preference for being involved in the dog's socialization from the beginning to minimize errors. this consideration shows a thoughtful and practical approach rather than an emotional or stressed reaction. the person is seeking advice and notes from others, which indicates openness and a proactive attitude. there is no indication of overwhelming worry or anxiety; instead, the focus is on planning and ensuring the best outcome for training a service dog. these elements suggest a rational and composed mindset, typical of someone not experiencing significant stress."
"Cigarettes used to help but they don't anymore. Alcohol helps, but then it comes back worse the next day. In the months that it's not happening, I'm well-adjusted. I thrive. But then my luck changes, someone starts listening to music next door or revving an old engine in their yard, and all my progress collapses.",1,"the narrative reveals a clear pattern of stress through the description of coping mechanisms and their diminishing effectiveness. the mention of cigarettes and alcohol as initial aids highlights attempts to self-medicate, which is a common indicator of stress. the narrative further illustrates the transient nature of relief, as the individual experiences a resurgence of distress, particularly intensified after using alcohol. this cyclical pattern of temporary relief followed by exacerbated stress is a hallmark of maladaptive coping strategies. the individual also describes periods of stability and thriving, which are abruptly disrupted by external stimuli such as noise from neighbors. this sensitivity to environmental triggers and the resultant collapse of progress underscores a heightened state of vulnerability and stress. the narrative's focus on the unpredictability of these stressors and the significant impact they have on the individual's well-being further supports the presence of ongoing stress."
"I have struggled all my life with weight. For the past month I have been dieting like a madman, counting calories, working out, etc. I have lose weight before in mass amounts so I do know how to diet and weigh food. But the scale will not budge, inches will not budge, nothing. So I decided that I am going to talk to my doctor about tapering off lexapro next week when I go in to see her.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has been diligently dieting and exercising but not seeing the expected results. while there is frustration expressed over the lack of progress, the individual remains proactive by planning to consult their doctor about possibly tapering off lexapro, which could be affecting their weight. this action-oriented approach and the decision to seek professional advice indicate a problem-solving mindset rather than one overwhelmed by stress. the narrative lacks signs of helplessness or overwhelming anxiety, focusing instead on practical steps and past successes, which are not typical indicators of significant stress."
"So thank you. My day got better. I am on medicine so I took my alprazolam and went to a store to try and find a dress for an upcoming wedding party. No luck.

"He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate. We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always ""busy"" helping his mum. Im mostly available, as I work part time as Im a student but I live in a rented shared flat. We seldom talk about the future. I want to talk about the future, I planned to work abroad this year as I graduate soon but stopped those plans after meeting him as he is only in college and will take another 3 years until he finishes education.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with some relationship concerns, but there are no overt signs of significant stress. the person mentions initiating contact more often and feeling that their partner is preoccupied with family obligations. while this might be frustrating, it doesn't necessarily indicate stress. the individual is also balancing part-time work and studies, which suggests they have some degree of control and stability in their life. the mention of future plans, although adjusted for the relationship, shows forward-thinking and adaptability rather than stress. overall, the narrative reflects a person managing typical relationship dynamics and life changes without evident stress markers."
"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of distress and turmoil. the individual describes a history of severe abuse from their parents, which is a major source of long-term psychological stress. the realization of this abuse, particularly at a later stage in life, suggests a deep-seated emotional burden. the traumatic event involving their daughter being molested by a younger brother, and the subsequent reaction of the parents, further exacerbates the stress. the involvement of child protective services and the police, coupled with the lack of resolution and the parents' reaction of calling the daughter a liar, adds layers of helplessness, frustration, and anger. these elements are indicative of high stress levels, as they involve complex emotional responses to trauma, betrayal, and the failure of familial support systems. the narrative also hints at the individual's struggle to protect their children and navigate the legal and emotional aftermath, which are significant stressors."
"I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have. A lot of my life is built on trying to be exciting, fun, or entertaining, I'm just scared I won't be able to keep it up for my partner. The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring, but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel, and it'll just lead to heartache. So, I've come to the most recent conclusion (after seeing my two best friends get girlfriends and me being the awkward loser who can't get one). That maybe I'm not the type of person who's built for relationships.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of anxiety and self-doubt, which are common indicators of stress. the author expresses a pervasive fear of not meeting their partner's expectations, highlighting an underlying concern about their ability to be exciting and engaging. this constant worry about being perceived as ""bland or boring"" suggests a preoccupation with negative self-evaluation and fear of rejection. the comparison with friends who have girlfriends exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and loneliness, reinforcing a belief that they are inherently unsuitable for relationships. such thoughts can contribute to a cycle of stress, where the individual feels overwhelmed by their perceived shortcomings and the pressure to conform to an idealized version of themselves. overall, the narrative is filled with themes of fear, self-criticism, and social comparison, which are indicative of a stressed mental state."
Which now leads me to where I am now. I had a talk with person A and she wants to get back together. Person B really wants a relationship with me. I don’t want to be a douche bag and cut things off with person b and then go back after my ex and have to deal with all the drama in between that. But I don’t really want my ex(person a) to go back and try to get into relationships and talk to all these guys.,0,"the narrative describes a situation involving relationship dynamics and decision-making. while the individual is contemplating the implications of their choices and the potential for drama, there is no explicit indication of significant stress. the person is weighing options and considering the feelings of others, which is a normal part of navigating relationships. the tone is more reflective and thoughtful rather than anxious or overwhelmed. the absence of language that conveys high levels of distress, such as expressions of being overwhelmed, feeling trapped, or experiencing physical symptoms, suggests that the individual is managing their situation without undue stress."
"My sister messaged me ""CALL ME ASAP"" I received her message at 1am when I woke up at my own home to use the restroom. I called my sister at that time, she answered the phone and I heard yelling and screaming. What happened was, My sister gave my father a ride back to wherever it was he came from - to get him out of their home. My father would not leave my moms home unless she also came along.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving family conflict, but it is recounted in a straightforward manner without evident emotional distress from the author. the writer explains the events factually, mentioning the time they received the message and the subsequent actions taken. while there is mention of yelling and screaming, which could be indicative of a stressful situation for those directly involved, the author themselves does not express personal feelings of anxiety, fear, or panic. the tone remains neutral and detached, suggesting that the author is not experiencing significant stress. this objective recounting of events without delving into emotional reactions is a key indicator that the author is not under stress."
"I was at work today and this guy I just met was just exuding this layer of confidence, he was; to an extent everything I wanted to be when it came to my relationships with others. There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.",1,"the narrative reveals significant internal conflict and self-doubt, which are classic indicators of stress. the author expresses envy towards a colleague who exhibits confidence and social ease, qualities the author desires but feels unable to achieve. this comparison leads to feelings of inadequacy and a perceived barrier to personal growth. the mention of a ""serious sense of envy"" and the contemplation of whether to change or stay the same highlights the author’s struggle with self-acceptance and decision-making. these elements suggest an ongoing internal tension, which is a common symptom of stress."
"We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing, and my threats are empty. He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex. Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels powerless and invalidated in their relationship. the repeated mention of feeling horrible and the partner's manipulative behavior are strong indicators of emotional distress. the individual's sense of worthlessness and the partner's coercive tactics, such as unpacking bags without consent, highlight a lack of control and autonomy. these feelings of helplessness and the constant emotional pressure are classic signs of stress. the narrative also shows a significant emotional burden, as the individual struggles with the partner's demands and the impact on their own mental health."
"That was nice. But now that we're close to the point of no return, with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week), and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound), I'm not sure what to do with myself. On one hand I want to let loose and detach, let her have fun, and do so myself. If it leads to a new LTR for her, awesome. But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of inner turmoil and uncertainty, which are classic indicators of stress. the author is dealing with a complex emotional situation involving their partner forming a potentially serious relationship with someone else. phrases like ""point of no return"" and ""i am not sure what to do with myself"" highlight a sense of impending change and lack of control. the internal conflict between wanting to support their partner and dealing with personal feelings of uncertainty and potential loss further exacerbates the stress. the mention of ""what kills me i guess is the uncertainty"" directly points to the anxiety and emotional strain the author is experiencing. these elements collectively paint a picture of an individual grappling with stress due to relational and emotional challenges."
"I’ve been in the mood since Friday night, we had a date and when we got tired and I let her go to sleep. Saturday morning I tried doing some forplay and she stopped me and told me to wait till later that night and she would make it up to me. Saturday night rolls around and she just falls asleep. Sunday morning I climb out of bed and start breakfast, and she said “Too bad you were asleep this morning, I tried to wake you up for something special...” Later that day we were getting ready for a birthday party, and she said, “I wish we could be undressing instead, but we got a party to go to...” I took that as a hint that later tonight she’ll finally be in the mood.",0,"the narrative describes a series of interactions over a weekend that involve anticipation and missed opportunities for intimacy. the tone of the narrative is casual and matter-of-fact, focusing on the sequence of events without expressing significant emotional distress or frustration. the individual recounts their experiences with a sense of patience and optimism, interpreting their partner's comments as hopeful signs for future intimacy rather than sources of anxiety or disappointment. this approach indicates a level of emotional regulation and an ability to maintain a positive outlook despite unmet expectations. the narrative lacks indicators of stress such as feelings of hopelessness, irritability, or overwhelming concern, which are often present in stressed individuals. instead, the person appears to be navigating their relationship dynamics with a balanced and composed mindset."
"Hey guys I just want to hear your opinions on this. So I’ve only had ptsd for about 5 years now after a near death experience and I just want to know if you guys think it is possible for me to be able to get rid of it for good. That fact that I was not born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I’ll be able to be the person I was before the incident. The issue is that even when I ask my therapist about this he tells me that my anxiety will always be there from now on, I just have to learn how to deal with it. What are your thoughts?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking advice and opinions regarding their post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) following a near-death experience. the person expresses a desire to return to their pre-incident self and is hopeful about overcoming their anxiety. despite the therapist's assertion that the anxiety may be a permanent aspect, the individual remains optimistic and proactive in seeking further input. the tone is inquisitive and reflective rather than distressed, indicating a level of acceptance and a constructive approach to managing their condition. this approach and the absence of immediate distress or overwhelming negativity are key indicators that suggest the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress."

In fact it is a guaranteed way to find yourself in JPSU or desk duty til they can boot you out the door. You CAN NOT start EMDR or CBT without telling your employer, your family and your support network what you are about to go through. &nbsp;",0,"the narrative reflects a clear and structured thought process, discussing the challenges faced by individuals in high-stress professions like the military, first responders, and medical personnel. despite the serious subject matter, the tone remains informative and matter-of-fact, rather than emotional or distressed. the author provides specific examples such as ptsd and the need for therapeutic interventions like emdr or cbt, but does so in a way that is focused on practical considerations and advice. the mention of the necessity to inform employers, family, and support networks further indicates a proactive and organized approach to managing potential stressors. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of personal emotional turmoil or cognitive overload, instead presenting a composed and reasoned discussion."
"Part of what makes good writing is having small specific details and the little stories that make up the novel as a whole. This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything ""epic"" and ""grand,"" it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to. If you have any questions about what I'm looking for, let me know - though I'm really looking for anything! Feel free to post them here, or private message me. Thank you in advance <3",0,"the narrative demonstrates a clear and focused intent on gathering specific details and personal stories for a writing project. the request is articulated in a calm and organized manner, with an emphasis on inclusivity and openness to any type of contribution. the language used is polite, encouraging, and devoid of any personal distress or urgency. the writer appears to be in control of their emotions and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to their creative process. there is no indication of personal turmoil or overwhelming stress, as the tone remains steady and composed throughout. the absence of negative emotional cues and the presence of a structured, goal-oriented request suggest a state of mental equilibrium rather than distress."

I signed up for Facebook over the weekend, and Corrine was in my suggested people to add.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and frustration, but it lacks the intensity and depth typically associated with significant stress. the individual is pondering about honesty and apologies, which suggests they are dealing with a relational issue, yet there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or a sense of being unable to cope. the act of signing up for facebook and noticing a suggested person to add indicates that the person is engaging in everyday activities and social interactions, which is less common in highly stressed individuals who often withdraw from such engagements. while the narrative does express some confusion and mild frustration, it does not convey the pervasive and debilitating nature of stress."
And I really don't know what to do.

Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, primarily rooted in the individual's traumatic past and the ongoing therapeutic process. the mention of surviving years of physical and sexual abuse suggests a deeply ingrained trauma, which is a substantial source of stress. the description of their current counseling sessions highlights the challenges they face in processing these experiences. the guided questions that prompt them to recall specific details they struggle to remember can trigger stress responses, as seen in their description of disorienting physical sensations and distorted perceptions. these sensations, such as feeling their body parts change size and experiencing a detachment from reality, are common symptoms of stress and trauma-related disorders. the comparison to the scene in ""inside out"" where characters become abstract shapes indicates a dissociative response, which is often a coping mechanism for managing overwhelming stress. the individual's trust in their therapist and willingness to work through their trauma are positive signs, but the intense reactions they describe are clear indicators of the stress they are experiencing as they confront their past."
"Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day. My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting. Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school. Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, as the author recounts a distressing childhood experience that continues to impact their current life. the mention of a rough five-year period during childhood, when life is typically expected to be carefree, highlights prolonged exposure to negative experiences. the description of school as ""a living hell"" and the exclusion from social activities are clear signs of social stress and isolation. the lasting effects on their worldview, perceiving it as harsh and unaccepting, suggest a deep-seated impact on their mental health. the author's acknowledgment of bullying as a direct cause of ongoing mental health issues further underscores the long-term psychological stress they endure. this narrative encapsulates a history of chronic stressors that have shaped the individual's mental and emotional state, revealing a pattern consistent with stress-related experiences."
"She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know. She did apologize a good day later, but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" kind of sense. I'm guessing a traditional ""we need to talk, it's just not working out"" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?",1,"the narrative contains multiple indicators of stress. the individual describes experiencing verbal abuse during a recent argument, which is a clear source of emotional distress. the mention of broken trust and the partner's vague apology further exacerbates feelings of betrayal and unresolved conflict. the anticipation of another negative reaction (""blowing up again"") adds to the anxiety and uncertainty about how to handle the situation. the person also expresses concern about the potential rudeness of ""ghosting"" versus the need to provide an explanation, highlighting an internal struggle and fear of confrontation. these elements collectively suggest a heightened state of stress, as the individual navigates complex emotional terrain and seeks a resolution that minimizes further conflict."
? What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I don’t want to upset her?? ? What if I am in the car with a man and some lady cuts him off and he gets road rage and says he wants to “drag her out of the car by her hair and cut her nipples off” but then later says he “obviously didn’t mean it”?? ?,1,"the narrative describes scenarios that are highly distressing and indicative of significant stress. the first situation involves a clear violation of personal boundaries and the added complexity of social dynamics, where the individual feels trapped between their discomfort and the desire not to upset their friend. this creates an internal conflict and anxiety. the second scenario depicts an instance of extreme road rage, where the man expresses violent and disturbing thoughts. such aggressive behavior, even if later dismissed as non-serious, can create a sense of fear and insecurity. both examples involve elements of unpredictability and threat, which are common triggers for stress. the narrative's focus on these intense, uncomfortable situations suggests a heightened state of alertness and concern, typical indicators of stress."
"It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the writer describes a confusing emotional experience, feeling the need to cry without a clear reason and then quickly returning to a neutral state. this emotional volatility is a common symptom of stress. the individual expresses confusion about the nature of stress, questioning whether it accumulates gradually or fluctuates daily. this uncertainty and the quest for understanding their emotional state suggest an ongoing struggle with stress. the mention of crying as a potential stress relief activity and the desire to quantify its impact further indicates that the person is actively seeking ways to manage their stress. overall, the narrative reflects a state of emotional turmoil and a search for coping mechanisms, which are typical indicators of someone experiencing stress."
It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me. He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying). I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom. I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened. I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him.,1,"the narrative describes a situation where the author feels controlled by tom, who exhibits overprotective behavior. tom's actions, such as not allowing the author to go anywhere alone and calling every half hour, indicate a high level of anxiety and fear for the author's safety. this controlling behavior can contribute to the author's stress, as it limits their autonomy and creates a sense of being constantly monitored. the mention of traumatic events and tom's fear during medical appointments and medication intake further underscores the stressful environment. the author's acknowledgment of tom's fear suggests empathy but also highlights the ongoing tension and pressure they feel. these elements, including the lack of personal freedom and the persistent anxiety surrounding medical issues, are typical indicators of a stressful situation."
"And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb. And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now. This is your past, this isn’t our present. I’ve never lied to you. I’ve always kept my promises to you.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through its vivid description of overwhelming anxiety and physical symptoms. phrases like ""ive come unglued"" and ""the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano"" suggest a loss of control and intense emotional distress. the mention of physical reactions such as ""cant breathe,"" ""shaking,"" and ""numb"" are classic symptoms of acute stress responses. additionally, the presence of a supportive figure trying to ground the individual in reality highlights the ongoing struggle with past trauma impacting the present, a common scenario in stress-related conditions. the narrative's focus on reassurance and promises indicates a need for stability and trust, further emphasizing the underlying stress and its psychological effects."
I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, including feelings of recklessness and impulsivity, which are often associated with underlying psychological distress. the author describes a tumultuous home life, marked by strained relationships with most relatives, except for their mother, who provided some stability. the contrast between the author's perceived role as the ""problem child"" and their brother as the ""golden child"" highlights a source of familial tension and shame, exacerbating feelings of inadequacy and stress. the mention of ptsd symptoms in adolescence further underscores the presence of significant psychological distress. the narrative also touches on the impact of a past assault and the subsequent secrecy imposed by the family, contributing to a complex emotional dynamic and internal conflict about sharing their story. the eventual meeting of the author's husband, who provides a sense of support and success, suggests a turning point but does not negate the stress experienced in the preceding years. these elements collectively illustrate a life marked by ongoing stress and the struggle to find stability amidst personal and familial challenges."
"Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so, who should I see for help?",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as the pervasive impact on the individual's daily life and working memory. the constant fear of triggering an adverse event, leading to social withdrawal and communication difficulties, is a significant stress indicator. the individual's mention of a neuropsychologist's limited assistance and the quest for more effective treatment options also underscores a sense of ongoing struggle and uncertainty, common in stressed individuals. the narrative's tone reflects a deep concern about their condition and a desire for resolution, which are typical signs of stress."
"No, that's not an exaggeration but I wish I was. While I was driving last Tuesday I got extremely lightheaded, sweaty, and then pulled over and vomited blood all over the interior of my car. After a few moments of wonder if 'this was it' and deciding 'it definitely wasn't it, not on a highway' I snapped by myself back to what life was left and drove to the next exit to find help. My SO has a great summary of why this ended up costing so much money, but it's a sequence of very unfortunate events. That's even before the fact that while I was intubated and unconscious someone lifted the bag of all my clothes wallet.",1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing experience involving severe physical symptoms while driving, such as lightheadedness, sweating, and vomiting blood, which are immediate indicators of acute stress and potential medical emergency. the mention of feeling like it might be the end, followed by the realization and determination to seek help, highlights a significant emotional and psychological strain. the reference to the high costs associated with the incident and the unfortunate theft of personal belongings while intubated and unconscious adds layers of financial and emotional stress. these elements combined paint a picture of someone dealing with significant stressors impacting both their physical and mental well-being."
"Well, not big but petty. Look, I live around the area of my assaulters. If I ever run into them, I wish I could yell out,” rapist! You know what you did!” I wish there would be witnesses and that they’d get to think about it. Gosh, I know.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for justice and confrontation but does not exhibit typical indicators of stress. while the individual recounts a traumatic event and expresses a wish for public acknowledgment of the assaulters' actions, the tone and focus are on the external situation rather than internal turmoil. there is a lack of language that indicates overwhelming emotional distress, such as feelings of anxiety, helplessness, or an inability to cope with daily life. the narrative is more centered on hypothetical scenarios and the desire for accountability, which suggests a level of emotional processing and a focus on external validation rather than internal suffering."
"I've never even told anyone this because it makes me feel like a 32-year-old loser. But now I have no pride to lose by saying it, so there it is. **I don't want to die, but the thought of living in a place I hate and having no control of my future is a worse fate. ** I just need some HOPE. Thanks for listening.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of stress. the author expresses feelings of shame and self-judgment, referring to themselves as a ""32-year-old loser,"" which suggests a deep sense of inadequacy and self-criticism. the lack of pride mentioned further highlights a diminished sense of self-worth. the phrase ""i do not want to die, but the thought of living in a place i hate and having no control of my future is a worse fate"" indicates a profound sense of despair and helplessness. this statement reflects a significant level of distress about their current living situation and future prospects, which are common stressors. the plea for hope at the end underscores a desperate need for emotional support and a way out of their current predicament. these elements collectively point to a high level of psychological stress, marked by hopelessness, self-deprecation, and a yearning for change."
"Things can happen during the course of life that are all quite normal, then something happens to change our perceptions and suddenly we can remember something that previously appeared innocuous to us, but with our new found perspective, we can feel guilty about it. And we can feel guilty about things we have done, we can feel guilty about things we didn't do, but wish we had, and of course we can feel guilty for nothing at all. We don't have to have done something or omitted to do something in order to feel guilty. Others can make us feel guilty through their expectations of us. Expectations can lead to disappointment, and their feeling of disappointment can lead to our feeling of guilt.",0,"the narrative discusses the concept of guilt and how it can arise from various sources, such as personal actions, inactions, and external expectations. it reflects on the normalcy of life events and how changes in perception can alter our feelings about past experiences. the narrative presents a thoughtful analysis of guilt without expressing personal distress or anxiety. it maintains a philosophical tone rather than a personal, emotional one, suggesting an objective exploration of the topic rather than a subjective experience of stress. the focus on general observations rather than personal struggles indicates a more contemplative rather than stressed state of mind."
"She is in need of some house repairs and a reliable car. Her fixed income and family support isn't enough to get everything done. The van she’s driving has some serious problems. The transmission is dying and there's no heater or defroster. The lights, blinkers, and brakes don't always work right due to electrical problems.",1,"the narrative reflects a situation characterized by significant stressors. the individual is dealing with multiple pressing issues, such as the need for house repairs and a reliable vehicle, which are exacerbated by financial constraints. the description of the van’s severe mechanical and electrical problems, including a failing transmission and malfunctioning lights, blinkers, and brakes, highlights the daily struggles and potential safety risks she faces. the lack of a heater or defroster adds to the discomfort and urgency of her situation. these factors collectively contribute to a high-stress environment, as they pose constant challenges and worries, impacting her overall well-being. the combination of financial limitations and the immediate need for repairs creates a scenario where stress is a natural response to the ongoing difficulties and uncertainties."
"However, this was 5 months ago and I have heard nothing about the referral. Things are going downhill (not with my eating, which is good! ), but my PTSD symptoms are loud. I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house. I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.",1,"the narrative exhibits multiple indicators of stress. the individual mentions a significant delay in a referral, suggesting a lack of support or resolution for their issues, which can be very stressful. they describe their ptsd symptoms as ""loud,"" indicating an overwhelming and intrusive presence in their daily life. the mention of not sleeping is a classic sign of stress and mental health struggles, as poor sleep can exacerbate other symptoms. the escalation of self-harm behaviors is a serious indicator of distress and an unhealthy coping mechanism. additionally, the difficulty in leaving the house points to anxiety and possible agoraphobia, both of which are stress-related conditions. finally, the imminent loss of their job due to the company's instability adds financial and existential stress, compounding the already significant emotional burden they are carrying. all these elements together paint a clear picture of an individual under considerable stress."
"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone. but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there. and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me. like it wasn't *actually*happening to me. I genuinely enjoy having sex, but I would like to know ways to lessen my trauma symptoms and stay present during it.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of psychological distress, particularly evident through the description of dissociation during the intimate encounter. dissociation, where the individual feels detached from their body or experiences, is a common symptom of stress and trauma. the person's memory of the event being hazy and viewing it from an external perspective are clear indicators of this dissociative state. additionally, the mention of trauma symptoms and the desire to find ways to stay present during sexual activity suggest ongoing psychological struggles. these elements collectively point to an underlying stress response, likely rooted in past traumatic experiences, affecting their current mental and emotional well-being."
"I realize that why I’m “ok” is because I am now past the acute phase of ptsd that I developed last year. The flashbacks are better- less often and less intense. I have learned to manage the panic attacks at work - I have a process to deal with these events now, and they often work. But the reason I’m really ok is because I don’t push myself at all to make friends, or date, or expand my life beyond work and my small world. I can’t expand it.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of stability and control despite the challenges faced by the individual. they acknowledge improvements in their condition, such as reduced frequency and intensity of flashbacks and the development of effective strategies to manage panic attacks. this indicates a level of self-awareness and proactive coping mechanisms. the person also recognizes their limitations and has accepted their current state without undue pressure to extend their social or personal life. this acceptance and the absence of self-imposed stressors suggest a state of equilibrium rather than ongoing stress. the narrative lacks expressions of acute distress or overwhelming anxiety, further supporting the conclusion that the individual is managing their situation well and is not currently experiencing significant stress."
Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back. If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories. When visiting my town now I am OK seeing those places but I don't like it so I avoid them. My choices are moving back or sell and start a new life elsewhere. So I ask if anyone else have done a similar move back to your hometown and managed well?,1,"the narrative reflects a person dealing with the lingering effects of past trauma and stress. the individual mentions their treatment has helped reduce triggering events, indicating they have been dealing with significant psychological distress. their consideration of moving back to a place associated with bad memories and their deliberate avoidance of certain locations suggest ongoing stress and anxiety. the dilemma of whether to move back or start anew elsewhere shows indecision and concern about their mental well-being. seeking advice from others who have managed similar situations indicates a need for reassurance and support, common in those experiencing stress. these elements collectively highlight the individual's struggle with stress and the impact of their past experiences on their current decision-making process."
"I want to sit down and have a talk with my GF, but I don't want to roll in unprepared. Should I even be attempting to have this talk? If so, are there any books or reading materials I can go over to help back my case up? --- **tl;dr**: Looking for ways to talk to my GF about her daughters spoiled behavior.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and proactive approach to addressing a concern within a relationship, indicating a mindset focused on problem-solving rather than stress. the individual expresses a desire to prepare for the conversation, seeking resources to support their position, which suggests a methodical and rational approach. the use of questions about whether to have the talk and how to prepare for it shows deliberation and a sense of control over the situation. the tone remains composed and constructive, focusing on finding solutions rather than expressing anxiety or distress. these elements are indicative of a non-stressed state, where the person is engaged in thoughtful planning and seeking effective communication strategies."
"when you first come face-to-face with a sociopath, you will be completely oblivious to who they truly are. they will be whoever they think you want them to be. they are fake. maybe it took him a while to show you his TRUE colors, maybe it was pretty close to the beginning. but the most important time was when you connected at the start.",0,"the narrative reflects a contemplative and analytical perspective rather than one driven by personal stress. the author discusses the characteristics of sociopaths in a detached and objective manner, focusing on the behavior and manipulative tactics rather than expressing personal emotional turmoil. phrases like ""they will be whoever they think you want them to be"" and ""they are fake"" suggest a general observation rather than a recounting of a stressful personal experience. the tone remains consistent and descriptive without veering into emotional distress or anxiety. overall, the narrative lacks indicators such as heightened emotional language, personal anecdotes of distress, or expressions of overwhelming feelings that are typically associated with stress."
So my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out i’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and that’s when my anxiety is the absolute WORST. everything flutters through my head. like i think i’m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me?? (he’s never expressed this. he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant anxiety and emotional distress following their roommate's departure. they mention having anxiety attacks and a heavy reliance on their boyfriend for emotional support, especially during nighttime when their anxiety peaks. the internal conflict about potentially annoying their boyfriend and the feelings of loneliness and sadness in their empty apartment are classic indicators of stress. these emotions are compounded by self-doubt and a sense of uselessness, suggesting a heightened state of psychological strain. the description of their mental state and behaviors aligns with typical stress responses, such as overthinking, feelings of isolation, and a need for reassurance."
"Disability allowance doesn't seem like it would be enough to cover even just my rent, never mind food (for me and my pets) and lighting and heating. I can't take my cat and my dog into a shelter. I don't know what to do. I feel like I just have to come to terms with how he is and learn to live with it but I'm miserable all the time. I don't have any friends anymore.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through various elements. the individual expresses concern about financial instability, specifically the insufficiency of disability allowance to cover basic needs such as rent, food, and utilities. this financial strain is a common stressor that can lead to feelings of helplessness and anxiety. additionally, the mention of pets and the inability to take them to a shelter underscores a sense of responsibility and emotional attachment, which can exacerbate stress when coupled with financial worries. the statement ""i do not know what to do"" highlights a sense of confusion and lack of direction, further indicating stress. the person's admission of being ""miserable all the time"" and the loss of social connections, as indicated by ""i do not have any friends anymore,"" suggests a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with multiple stressors, leading to a pervasive feeling of being overwhelmed and unsupported."
But Someone asked me if I needed a shirt and gave me one. I asked to call my mom but she couldn't understand what I was saying so he told her. The ambulance showed up and I told the cops that my boyfriend beat me but I wasn't giving any more information. The ambulance lady told me that if I refused to go with her she would take me against my will because I was exhibiting signs of head trauma. I went.,0,"the narrative describes a series of distressing events, including an interaction with law enforcement and medical personnel following an alleged assault. despite the gravity of the situation, the writer recounts these events in a relatively straightforward manner, without expressing overt emotional distress or anxiety. the tone is factual and devoid of emotional language, which might suggest a level of detachment or coping mechanism that doesn't align with typical stress responses. indicators such as a lack of descriptive language about personal feelings or thoughts, and the absence of expressions of fear, panic, or overwhelming worry, contribute to the assessment. these elements suggest that while the situation is serious, the writer is recounting it in a manner that doesn't convey immediate psychological stress."
"*Road to homelessness. * I develop the idea that I was going to die young, at around 21 yrs old. I dont remember how I came to this idea but this was it. I was obsessed by this idea.",0,"the narrative describes a significant and distressing thought process where the individual developed an obsession with the idea of dying young. however, despite the intense nature of this belief, the narrative does not provide further context or evidence of ongoing stress-related symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or behavioral changes that typically accompany high stress levels. the description is more focused on a specific and isolated thought rather than a broader pattern of stress-related issues. while the idea of dying young is undoubtedly troubling, the absence of additional stress indicators such as emotional distress, physical symptoms, or disruption in daily functioning suggests that this thought alone may not be sufficient to classify the individual as experiencing stress."
"It was only thanks to a few friends (and a few wonderful strangers here on Reddit) that I was able to pay our electric bill, but doing so drained all of the money we had on hand, and once we used the food we had from the food bank (we can only go once a month here) we are now totally out of most things. At the moment, we can't even do laundry because we don't have the quarters, but that's a smaller problem compared to no food. If anyone wants to help, my sister and I made a wishlist that I'm including here. Any help is greatly appreciated! [Amazon <url>",0,"the narrative describes a challenging financial situation where the author has had to rely on friends, strangers, and food banks to meet basic needs such as paying the electric bill and obtaining food. despite these hardships, the tone of the narrative is more focused on seeking assistance and expressing gratitude rather than displaying signs of stress. the author acknowledges the help received and is proactive in reaching out for further support, which indicates a level of coping and resilience. the mention of specific strategies to address their needs, such as creating a wishlist, suggests a problem-solving approach rather than one overwhelmed by stress. the narrative lacks the typical indicators of stress such as feelings of hopelessness, excessive worry, or a sense of being unable to manage the situation. instead, it reflects a pragmatic and community-oriented mindset."
"Hi Im a 19 year old kid dealing with Agoraphobia over the past year. Very boldly said, Agoraphobia is the fear of going to public places, sometimes to even leave the house. The past week, some very unpleasant things have happened in my household. I told my parents about what I've been dealing with a while back.",1,"the narrative describes a young individual struggling with agoraphobia, a condition characterized by the fear of public places and sometimes even leaving the house. this condition itself is a significant indicator of stress, as it severely limits the person's ability to engage in everyday activities. the mention of ""very unpleasant things"" happening in the household over the past week adds another layer of stress, suggesting a potentially unstable or distressing home environment. the fact that the individual has communicated their struggles to their parents indicates an attempt to seek support, which is a common response to overwhelming stress. overall, the combination of dealing with a debilitating anxiety disorder and experiencing recent household disturbances are clear indicators of a high-stress situation."
"Well, last time we fought, I did finally call. I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him. They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures. Well, what do you know, he got a warrant. He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.",0,"the narrative describes a highly distressing situation involving a confrontation that led to police intervention. the writer expresses intense fear and anxiety, evident in phrases like ""i was so fucking scared"" and the description of the partner hiding in the basement. the recounting of the police taking pictures of injuries and the subsequent legal consequences further highlights a traumatic experience. despite these indicators of acute stress and trauma, the context suggests that the narrative might be reflecting on past events with a degree of detachment or resolution, which can sometimes lead to a classification that might seem counterintuitive. however, it's important to consider the complexity of stress responses and the possibility that the writer has processed these events differently over time."
"A guy pulls up and said the cops are on the way. He gives me a ride and we just get out of the parking lot when cops are all over, bugging everyone...especially the homeless and kids skating and stuff. We saw a few people getting arrested, but just cops messing with people. 2 good things came out of all this. I didn't get busted and I made a new friend who got me lunch and wants to see me.",0,"the narrative describes a potentially stressful situation involving police presence and arrests, yet the author focuses on the positive outcomes of the experience. the person recounts the event in a relatively calm and matter-of-fact manner, emphasizing that they avoided trouble and made a new friend. the mention of receiving lunch and having a future social connection suggests that the individual is able to find silver linings and maintain a positive outlook despite the chaotic environment. this ability to identify and appreciate positive aspects amidst potential stressors indicates resilience and a lack of overwhelming stress. the overall tone of the narrative is not one of distress or anxiety, but rather of relief and positivity."
"There's nothing I can say or do that will alleviate her worries. In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help. I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like ""that does sound bad"" or ""I understand"" but those don't seem to help either. Does anyone have advice on what I can do or say to not cause anger or start a fight? I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of helplessness and frustration, which are strong indicators of stress. the individual expresses a feeling of inadequacy in trying to alleviate someone else's worries, indicating a significant emotional burden. the repeated attempts to solve issues or offer empathetic comments, only to find them ineffective, contribute to a sense of futility and stress. the plea for advice and the fear of causing anger or conflict further underline the person's anxiety and concern about the situation. overall, the narrative's tone of desperation and confusion about how to act or respond effectively points to a stressed state of mind."
"But I'm not physically attracted to him. Normally personality does a lot for me. I've met guys who I didn't feel attracted to and then started to really like because of their personalities (and vice versa). I go through days where I skype this guy and like the idea of him and feel like I can be physically attracted to him, but there are other days I don't feel anything physically. We are very long distance at the moment, so we've haven't had any face to face in person time for the past month (he's moving in 5 months).",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and reflective process about feelings and attraction. the individual discusses their experiences and fluctuations in physical attraction with a sense of curiosity rather than distress. the mention of long-distance circumstances and the lack of face-to-face interaction are presented as factual observations rather than sources of significant emotional turmoil. the writer's ability to consider different perspectives and acknowledge the potential for change in feelings suggests a balanced and composed mindset. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of acute stress, such as overwhelming anxiety, pervasive worry, or feelings of hopelessness. instead, it demonstrates a reasoned approach to navigating complex emotions."
"My sickness couldn't be diagnosed at the time w/o insurance. I was too ill to remain in NYC so had to move home. Fast forward to Jan 2014, living with my father in Ohio-I woke up paralyzed from the waist down on the left hand side of my body (lasted almost two months). Finally got the testing I needed: diagnosis MS. I also have Fibromyalgia, OA in my knees, central sleep apnea, MDD, and other various health issues.",0,"the narrative describes a series of significant health challenges, including multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, central sleep apnea, and major depressive disorder. despite these severe conditions, the author provides a clear and factual recounting of their medical history without expressing emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety. the tone is straightforward and lacks the urgency or emotional turmoil typically associated with stress. the focus remains on the medical facts and chronology rather than on feelings of helplessness, fear, or frustration. this calm and matter-of-fact presentation suggests that the individual is managing their situation with a level of acceptance and resilience, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I just stop doing productive things, talking to people, remembering appointments, etc. I am unemployed and almost broke but looking for work is causing me to feel like I can't swallow or get a full breath. I find that I have played video games all day, surfed Reddit or this morning I read reviews on a book that is coming out for almost 2 hours. I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway.

"Therefore, it should probably come as no surprise that I sprung the question of ""What exactly are we doing here?"". Well, that backfired, as he alluded to the fact he was too freshly out of a long term relationship and didn't want to commit yet (Jason had been single for more than a year and it was a 3 year relationship). I bit my tongue until it bled and told him that was okay because we had more friends in common by that point, despite saying I needed some direct space for a few weeks or more.

"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it. I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured. Now I feel like it is all that I live for, a part of me really likes how kindly she is.

"I've been seeing the same one since then, and she'd helped me process so much, help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things...

I care about him, his wellbeing, but... That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out... The only time I ever stood up to him.

"With all of this garbage happening to me, I find it hard to keep my chin up and to not be negative. By anticipating the worst and vocalizing it, I feel as though I have a better chance of avoiding the worst, because I'm still suffering (making myself unlikable or making a fool of myself). Additionally, if the situation turns out better than expected, I will be pleasantly surprised, and not let down when something goes wrong. Because of this, my relationship with my family is horrible as well. I don't want to lose one of my few friends over this, but I have no idea how to change or if such a thing is even possible.",1,"the narrative reveals significant signs of stress through expressions of negativity and pessimism. the individual mentions struggling to maintain a positive outlook and frequently anticipates the worst-case scenarios, which is a common cognitive pattern in stressed individuals. this anticipatory anxiety serves as a coping mechanism to avoid disappointment but simultaneously perpetuates a cycle of negativity and stress. the person also acknowledges the impact of their stress on their relationships, noting a deteriorating relationship with family and fear of losing friends. the sense of helplessness and uncertainty about change further underscores their stressed state, as these feelings are typical in individuals who feel overwhelmed by their circumstances."

I decided to get a workbook and my therapist and I are going to start the long journey of getting through my PTSD!",0,"the narrative details a challenging period following a significant event that affected the individual's mental health. despite the initial lack of improvement with group counseling, the person took proactive steps by seeking individual therapy and eventually received a formal diagnosis from a psychiatrist. the mention of obtaining a workbook and planning a structured approach with their therapist indicates a forward-looking attitude and a commitment to managing their conditions. this narrative reflects a sense of progress and hope, which are important indicators of resilience and effective coping strategies, rather than overwhelming stress. the individual's ability to articulate their journey and the steps they are taking to address their mental health concerns demonstrates a level of control and optimism that is not typically associated with acute stress."
I don't know what to do right now. I'm having so much anxiety and I feel that there is no hope for me right now. It took a lot of effort to post this. I panic very easily.

"Two of my best friends for the last 10 years are drifting away from me. I got diagnosed with PTSD 1½ year ago, and back then they were very supportive. But in the last 6-9 months; in fact, almost ever since early retirement funded by the government got on the table, they havn't contacted me that much. Normally, we write through email, but it's been around 3 months since I last got an email from them. Yesterday, I took initiative and wrote them both CC.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels a sense of drifting apart from long-term friends, mentioning a diagnosis of ptsd and a change in communication patterns. while these elements could be potential stressors, the individual's response to the situation does not strongly indicate active stress. instead, they took proactive steps to reach out and re-establish contact, which suggests a level of coping and problem-solving ability. the mention of early retirement might imply some changes in life circumstances, but there is no expression of overwhelming anxiety or distress. the overall tone appears more reflective and action-oriented rather than indicative of significant stress."
"Help me out here, fellow anxious, if we gather maybe we could create an elaborate plan to help me avoid this, idk I have phone phobia. These are really important conversations that I'll be calling to have and a lot depends on my explaining things and my demeanour and a lot of things could go so terribly wrong and I'm just so absolutely socially inept and phone calls are one of the worst ways for me to say words and make sense and - please help. 😔😔",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of anxiety and phobia related to phone calls. the writer explicitly mentions having ""phone phobia,"" which is a clear sign of stress and anxiety. the urgency and desperation in the plea for help, along with the repeated emphasis on the importance of the upcoming conversations and the potential for things to go ""terribly wrong,"" further highlight the individual's heightened stress levels. the self-description as ""socially inept"" and the difficulty in communicating effectively over the phone are additional stress indicators. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant anxiety and stress about an impending task that involves social interaction and communication."
"What would your arguments be? To me it seems that the same reasoning would have to be behind the "" male cancer"" types: do not be afraid to get it checked out, value your body to pay attention to the deviations, and be aware of the actions you have to take to identify the problem and survive. Your comments and contributions are welcome. If this is not the appropriate subreddit to ask this, please suggest other subreddits to post this to. Thanks",0,"the narrative displays a logical and composed approach to discussing health awareness, particularly concerning male cancer. the writer emphasizes the importance of regular check-ups, valuing one's body, and being proactive in identifying potential health issues. this indicates a rational and preventive mindset rather than one overwhelmed by stress. the invitation for comments and contributions suggests openness to dialogue and a community-oriented perspective, which are not typically associated with high stress levels. the mention of seeking appropriate platforms for discussion shows an organized and thoughtful approach, further indicating a lack of distress or urgency. overall, the narrative's tone is calm, informative, and constructive, which are not characteristics commonly linked with significant stress."

I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door. When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it.

"That could be defeated by National Post printing a rebuttal, strongly worded and well researched (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta piece Cosh wrote and Owens supported) explaining the science behind PTSD Service dogs: science that has been peer reviewed and minutely studied since 2002. But sadly, as of now the National Post refuses to stand by the oath of all journalists that speaks to integrity and education. &nbsp; >Brian here: If a politician said something this stupid, they’d be sent for a sensitivity class and left off the nomination papers next election.

And all occupants passed away in that accident.",0,"the narrative describes a traumatic event involving a car accident, the loss of loved ones, and the subsequent rescue attempt. despite the gravity of the situation, the narrative is recounted in a factual and detached manner, lacking personal emotional reflection or expressions of distress. there are no indications of ongoing emotional turmoil or stress symptoms such as anxiety, hyperarousal, or intrusive thoughts. the focus remains on the sequence of events rather than the narrator's emotional state, which suggests an absence of stress in the recounting of the incident. this detached recounting can indicate that the narrator may have processed the event or is discussing it from a distance, rather than being currently overwhelmed by stress."
"I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in. I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space. I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out.

I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was. What do I do? I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear. I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me?

"I'm trying to figure out what I learned that is good from it. but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself, people are inconsistent and unstable, people don't know themselves, if love exists then it doesn't mean much, and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it, they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice. the more I process what happened the more I realize there is truly no hope for me finding the kind of relationship I hope for, and there is really nothing else worth living for besides that. so, fun stuff. right?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of mistrust and disillusionment with interpersonal relationships, which are common indicators of stress. the author expresses a belief that people are inconsistent, unstable, and incapable of genuine self-awareness. these thoughts suggest a pervasive sense of betrayal and disappointment, likely stemming from past experiences that have eroded their ability to trust others, including themselves. the mention of love being meaningless and the despair over the potential for finding a fulfilling relationship point to a significant emotional burden and a bleak outlook on the future. the narrative also conveys feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, which are classic symptoms of stress and possibly depression. the closing remark, ""so, fun stuff. right?"" hints at a cynical attempt to mask or cope with the intensity of their distress, further emphasizing the underlying emotional turmoil."
"I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible> We met 6 months ago and it was instant chemistry. We fell in love pretty quickly and we used to talk all the time about how surprised we were at our feelings and how we had never felt like this before. Anyway a month ago he started calling less, he would still drive the few hours to come and see me but the communication between us seeing each other was lacklustre. I'm not usually clingy but we used to talk on the phone several times a day. this turned into a 5 minute call.",1,"the narrative indicates a significant change in a previously close relationship, which can be a common source of stress. the initial description of instant chemistry and frequent communication sets a high emotional baseline, making the subsequent decline in contact more impactful. the shift from regular, lengthy conversations to brief, infrequent calls suggests a potential loss of emotional connection, which can lead to feelings of insecurity and anxiety. the mention of not usually being clingy but noticing and being affected by the change highlights the narrator's distress. this sense of unease and the attempt to rationalize or understand the partner's behavior are indicative of stress."
I made a decision that I had enough of this fear and I was going to die fighting and not be afraid anymore. I reached this point a few years ago. It is a wonderful thing to sleep peacefully.

I was tired of sleeping on the sofa or on the floor of different rooms just to avoid sleeping in bedrooms because of fear.,0,"the narrative describes a journey from a state of fear and anxiety to one of resolution and peace. the individual recounts a significant turning point where they decided to confront their fears rather than succumb to them. the mention of sleeping peacefully now indicates a successful overcoming of previous stressors. the details about past behaviors, such as wanting to sleep in the trunk of a car or avoiding bedrooms, illustrate the extent of the fear they once experienced. however, these behaviors are spoken of in the past tense, suggesting they are no longer part of the individual's current experience. this shift from past anxiety to present calmness is a key indicator that the person is no longer experiencing stress. the narrative reflects a sense of accomplishment and tranquility, typical of someone who has resolved their stress rather than someone who is still in the midst of it."

Even if it's midnight, he'll make my mom wake me up, even tho I don't want to. But I'll comply because I was afraid to refuse as he could get quite angry if I do so.

I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again, this is a throwaway, so I don't mind), if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there, and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job, it will). I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline, or lied about calling the police, or *something* - in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here. Any ideas? EDIT: In case it isn't clear, I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived, due to what happened between the call and their arrival.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant amount of anxiety and concern, which are common indicators of stress. the writer is second-guessing their actions and is preoccupied with thoughts of what they could have done differently. this kind of rumination is a typical sign of stress, as the individual is unable to let go of the incident and is continuously questioning their decisions. the mention of a domestic violence incident adds a layer of emotional intensity, which likely exacerbates the stress. the use of phrases like ""i keep telling myself there was something i could have done"" indicates a sense of guilt or responsibility, which can be overwhelming and stressful. additionally, the writer's anticipation of similar future incidents (""knowing my job, it will"") suggests a chronic stressor in their professional environment. overall, the narrative is characterized by a high level of emotional turmoil and self-doubt, which are strong indicators of stress."

I'm not very big, and while I pushed back for a while, she eventually pushed me out of the room and slammed the door.",0,"the narrative describes a heated argument between two individuals, highlighting a series of emotionally charged interactions. the use of words like ""angrily,"" ""heated,"" and ""bitch"" indicates strong emotions, but these emotions are more indicative of anger and conflict rather than stress. the focus on physical actions, such as throwing a blanket, gathering things, and physical pushing, further emphasizes the confrontational nature of the situation. while stress can be a component of such conflicts, the narrative primarily reflects an episode of interpersonal anger and frustration rather than a broader pattern of stress. the emphasis on the immediate altercation and the description of specific actions and reactions suggest a situational response rather than an ongoing state of stress."

"I was a little confused at what they meant so her husband decided to meet me and talk to me about what was going on. The way that he put it, he was saying that my husband wouldn't get physical from what he could tell, but there are boundaries that he passed. Unfortunately, he couldn't provide any examples because he couldn't remember what was said, but he could remember the feeling that he had, and it was disgust. This was during the holiday season when their company had an influx of new people and they would be gone within a few weeks because the work they do is very physical and not a lot of people can handle it. My friends husband told me and quote, ""There's friendship, there's flirting, which he did but its innocent because everyone flirts, but then there's certain boundaries that you don't say to someone else while being in a commited relationship or marriage with someone else and he was doing that.""",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a discussion about boundaries and behavior in relationships, particularly focusing on the actions of the narrator's husband. despite the potentially sensitive nature of the topic, the tone remains relatively neutral and factual. the narrator recounts a conversation with a friend's husband who expressed concerns about the narrator's husband's behavior, particularly in the context of workplace interactions. while there is mention of discomfort and disgust from the friend's husband, the narrator does not express personal distress or anxiety. instead, the narrative focuses on relaying the events and the opinions of others without delving into personal emotional responses. the absence of strong emotional language or indications of personal turmoil suggests a lack of significant stress on the part of the narrator. overall, the narrative is characterized by a descriptive and objective recounting of events rather than an emotionally charged or stress-indicative account."

The color of my skin and the color of the fear were almost a perfect match although my fear was clearly a shade lighter than what was underneath. Who could know?,0,"the narrative describes a series of intense and disturbing experiences, but it appears to be more poetic and metaphorical rather than a direct expression of personal stress. the use of vivid imagery such as ""marks of his affections,"" ""pulled out my tears,"" and ""dipped in white tint"" suggests a creative and artistic approach to expressing emotions rather than a straightforward account of personal distress. while the content is dark and evocative, it lacks specific indicators of current stress, such as mentions of overwhelming anxiety, inability to cope, or direct expressions of feeling stressed. the narrative's abstract and symbolic nature makes it more aligned with a literary piece rather than a direct cry for help or a reflection of immediate stress."

"I don’t know how it’s physically possible to be this anxious on this level of medication. To be fair my anxiety and racing thoughts about going back to the first employer are so bad that I can’t even really watch TV, so healthy coping mechanisms are pretty sparse. I’m really only posting this because I seriously can’t believe that a) I can physiologically sustain this and b) that I still have been going to work every day. I guess I come home and break down every day too, so there’s that. I wish so bad I hadn’t done that, and it’s like my brain is living in this loop of both regret and fear, as well as rage at myself for thinking that would be the answer.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of distress and anxiety. the individual expresses disbelief at their own physiological capacity to endure such high levels of anxiety despite being on medication, indicating that the medication may not be effectively managing their symptoms. the mention of ""racing thoughts"" and the inability to engage in typically relaxing activities like watching tv suggests pervasive anxiety. the writer also highlights a lack of healthy coping mechanisms, which can exacerbate stress. their astonishment at maintaining daily work routines amidst this turmoil, coupled with daily emotional breakdowns, underscores the severity of their condition. the regret and self-directed rage mentioned are also indicative of stress, as these emotions often accompany chronic anxiety and can create a cyclical pattern of negative thinking. the repetitive nature of their thoughts and the emotional loop of regret, fear, and rage further illustrate the depth of their psychological struggle. these elements collectively point to a state of significant stress."
I would never think of having a talk like that with my ex and not telling my GF. It seems to be lying by omission in a relationship where we agreed there would be no secrets. Should I confront her? Suggestions on how to broach this? ---,0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and reflective approach to a relationship dilemma. the individual is considering the implications of their actions and seeking advice on how to address the situation, which indicates a level-headed and proactive mindset. the mention of ""agreed there would be no secrets"" suggests a commitment to transparency and honesty, key elements of a healthy relationship. the use of questions like ""should i confront her?"" and ""suggestions on how to broach this?"" shows a desire to handle the situation constructively rather than impulsively. these factors collectively point to a rational and balanced state of mind, rather than one characterized by stress."
"I have a short term plan, but nothing long term at all. I’m assuming she’s going to shut off my phone in the next 24 hours, so I’ll have no access to texting or calling services until fiancé can afford to put me on his plan. Unfortunately, he may lose his job because he was living with me and my mom. Today we had a really bad fight and she’s at home while I’m outside... I don’t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go, with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, evident in the uncertainty and instability described by the individual. the mention of a lack of long-term plans and the imminent loss of phone service highlight a sense of insecurity and helplessness. the anticipation of being cut off from communication channels adds to the anxiety. the individual's fiance potentially losing his job due to their living situation further compounds the stress, suggesting financial and relational instability. the reference to a severe fight with the mother and the immediate consequence of being outside with nowhere to go underscores acute distress. the minimal financial resources and lack of direction amplify feelings of vulnerability and desperation. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with high levels of stress, characterized by unpredictability, strained relationships, and financial uncertainty."
"Days where it is really good, and days where you are anxious seemingly out of nowhere? It's like the brain is running on some sort of cycle or something. Like a circadian rhythm but an anxiety rhythm? EDIT: Found this article after posting, it's super helpful and if I didn't put it here some of you may have missed it. Take a read right now, it's worth it!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of curiosity and an attempt to understand personal experiences with anxiety, but it does not exhibit significant signs of distress or overwhelm. the author mentions having good days and anxious days, suggesting an awareness of fluctuating emotions, which is quite normal. the comparison to a circadian rhythm indicates a rational approach to understanding their experiences. furthermore, the tone is inquisitive rather than distressed, and the author even shares a helpful resource, indicating a proactive and positive attitude. this combination of self-awareness, rational thought, and proactive behavior suggests that the author is not experiencing significant stress."
"I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately, 100%, thought I was going to die. I don't think I've ever been so scared. I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory. Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness. I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.",1,"the narrative indicates a high level of stress through several key aspects. the writer describes an intense fear of dying, which is a profound emotional response often associated with acute stress or trauma. the mention of crying when revisiting diary entries suggests that the memory of the event continues to evoke strong emotional reactions, indicating that the stress is persistent and impactful. the experience of numbness, a symptom that can be both physical and emotional, further supports the presence of stress. numbness can be a defense mechanism against overwhelming emotions or a physical manifestation of anxiety. the combination of fear, ongoing emotional distress, and physical symptoms points to a significant level of stress."
"I'm sharing this in case it helps anyone else like me. Some other ideas that were suggested by other people when I posted this elsewhere include voting early if your state allows it, and researching the candidates ahead of time (League of Women Voters is good for this: <url> If anyone has anything else to add to this list, feel free! And remember that elections in the US are in exactly one week, November 6. 1. PLAN AHEAD.",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and organized mindset, which is often indicative of a non-stressed individual. the author is providing helpful suggestions and resources to others, demonstrating a sense of community and support. there is a clear focus on practical steps, such as voting early and researching candidates, which suggests a level-headed approach to an upcoming event. the mention of planning ahead and the specific date of the election shows that the individual is prepared and thinking ahead, rather than being overwhelmed by immediate stressors. overall, the tone is positive, collaborative, and forward-thinking, all of which are signs of a non-stressed state."
Suddenly everyone in the family was doing as she wished to appease her. FH is her youngest and always around when she has 'flares'. She has refused medication which made her flares better for fear of the side effects (palpitations). The flares make her cry and demand death come sooner. His sister is much less involved and appears to have the same POV I do about his mother's illness.,0,"the narrative describes a family dynamic centered around an individual with recurring health issues, referred to as 'flares.' despite the emotional and physical challenges posed by these flares, the family members' actions suggest a supportive and accommodating environment. the mention of refusing medication due to fear of side effects shows a conscious decision-making process, which, while difficult, indicates a level of control and agency. although there are moments of distress, such as crying and expressing a desire for death, these reactions are contextualized within the illness and do not necessarily reflect a broader, pervasive sense of stress in the narrator. the sister's detachment and shared perspective with the narrator further imply a balanced, if not entirely stress-free, approach to handling the situation. overall, the narrative lacks the intense, pervasive signs of stress typically characterized by feelings of being overwhelmed, helplessness, or a lack of support."
"I feel so damaged by my childhood that I feel like I could never be fixed. Everything he's said is true about me. I am stupid, crazy, cunt, bitch, whore, and people only want me for my body. I feel so ready to just go. I hate myself so much.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as intense feelings of self-loathing and hopelessness. the individual describes a deeply negative self-image, using derogatory terms that suggest a history of emotional abuse. phrases like ""i feel so damaged by my childhood"" and ""i hate myself so much"" highlight a profound sense of despair and internalized negative beliefs. the mention of being ready ""to just go"" could indicate suicidal ideation, which is a critical marker of severe psychological distress. these elements collectively suggest that the person is experiencing significant emotional turmoil and stress."
"She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves. That was a bit frightening. But I guess at that stage the police were already here, because the abuse from him starts. “Oh you actually called the fucking cops did you?” “Why would you call the fucking cops?” “I can’t believe you’d call the fucking cops”. Three days later, I’ve just checked the phone.",1,"the narrative describes a situation involving intense emotional turmoil and conflict. the mention of the police and the abusive behavior from ""him"" suggests a high-stress environment. the repeated questioning and disbelief about calling the police indicate a confrontation that likely escalated tension. the use of strong language and the fact that the person checks the phone days later suggest ongoing anxiety and concern about the events that transpired. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as they reflect fear, conflict, and a sense of being overwhelmed by the situation."
"When she was an infant, she would play with her when she was told to leave her alone. She would do things she wasn't supposed to. She often acted like Grace was her child. It didn't help that Anna is mature looking at 5'8"", and was often asked if Grace was her baby. Around when Grace was 18 months, I got asked less and less to watch her, and Anna was doing it.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where anna, a mature-looking individual, took on a caregiving role for grace, despite being told not to. the context suggests that anna's behavior might be seen as nurturing or overstepping boundaries, but there is no indication of emotional distress or psychological strain in the author's recounting. instead, the narrative is more observational and descriptive, lacking expressions of anxiety, worry, or emotional turmoil. the shift in caregiving responsibility from the author to anna is mentioned without any signs of stress or negative impact on the author's mental state. this calm and factual recounting suggests a non-stressful perspective on the events described."
"My heart races and my hands start to sweat, I immediately feel as if I need to pee and then worry as there’s no bathroom (on the train at least). The unknown is the problem here – how long will I be trapped? I know this is stupid – I know I am fine, I know in all likelihood we will be moving again shortly, but it’s the constant what ifs that set me off. I look around and everyone else looks perfectly calm – perhaps mumbling at the inconvenience, but I am gripped with fear. I hate it.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant physical and emotional symptoms indicative of stress. the racing heart, sweaty hands, and urgent need to urinate are classic physiological responses to anxiety. the individual's fixation on the lack of a bathroom and the uncertainty of the situation highlight a common stressor: the fear of being trapped without a solution. despite their rational understanding that the situation is likely temporary and harmless, the persistent ""what ifs"" exacerbate their stress. the contrast between their intense fear and the calm demeanor of others around them further isolates the individual, intensifying their feelings of distress. this narrative clearly illustrates the impact of anxiety on both mind and body, showing how stress can override logical thinking and lead to overwhelming fear."
"Let alone his assault charges from beating her, RIGHT? If it did, what would be her options with the issue of the lease she wouldn't be able to afford? I desperately want to help her with this situation. I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault. I refuse to let that happen.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of concern and responsibility for another person's well-being, which is often indicative of stress. the writer expresses desperation and a sense of urgency in wanting to help someone who is facing serious issues, such as assault charges and financial difficulties. the repeated use of phrases like ""desperately want to help"" and ""i refuse to let that happen"" suggests an intense emotional investment and a fear of negative outcomes. the writer's worry about being at fault if they do not intervene further highlights a sense of personal responsibility and guilt, common feelings in individuals experiencing stress. these elements together point to the writer's heightened emotional state and preoccupation with the situation, which are clear indicators of stress."
I would also be so grateful if you could just pray for her and our family during this time. Also if anyone is familiar with this type of serious health issue I would be so glad to hear about it so I know more about what she is fighting. They have told us the cultures came back streptococcus pneumoniae one of the most common forms of strep. Thanks for reading. <url>,0,"the narrative reflects a concern for a loved one's health and a request for prayers and information, which is a normal and expected reaction in such circumstances. the tone is composed and the language used is clear and organized, indicating the writer is managing their emotions effectively. there are no signs of overwhelming anxiety or distress; instead, the writer is seeking support and information in a rational manner. the mention of gratitude and a clear explanation of the medical situation suggests that the writer is coping with the situation in a balanced way. overall, the narrative shows a level-headed approach to a challenging situation, which aligns with the absence of stress indicators."
"I'm not mad, but it makes it very hard to compete as I'm quickly figuring out that my school was fairly easy and I did not try very hard. Which yes it is my fault, but I didn't think I was going to have to compete with the best of the best. Just know the course well. I have always been able to apply myself, endless amounts of will power with a drive to learn. So yeah I thought I could learn what I needed to know, but it's more than that, it's knowing EVERY little fucking thing about everything because that's how much everyone else knows.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and self-doubt, which are common indicators of stress. the individual acknowledges their previous academic environment was less challenging and now feels overwhelmed by the higher level of competition. the language used, particularly phrases like ""endless amounts of will power"" and ""knowing every little fucking thing,"" suggests an intense pressure to meet high standards. the self-blame and recognition of the need to compete with ""the best of the best"" further highlight feelings of inadequacy and stress. these elements collectively indicate the individual is experiencing significant stress related to their current academic situation."
"Needless to say that is all a lie from him, He is here from DSS/Social Services just like I am. What I am worried about is my safety and security. This guy is obviously mentally ill and a drug addict and alchie, and now I am really concerned that he will do something to me because I stood up to him and his nonsense bullshit. How should I proceed....Call Social Services and turn him in? or call the police next time he harasses me?",1,"the narrative reveals significant signs of stress through the writer's expression of fear and concern for their safety. the use of phrases like ""needless to say that is all a lie"" and ""i am really concerned"" highlights a sense of urgency and anxiety. the writer's preoccupation with their security and the potential threat posed by another individual suggests a heightened state of alertness and worry. labeling the other person as ""mentally ill,"" a ""drug addict,"" and an ""alchie"" indicates a perception of danger and unpredictability, which can exacerbate stress levels. the indecision about whether to call social services or the police also reflects a state of distress and confusion, common in individuals experiencing stress. overall, the narrative's focus on personal safety, mistrust, and the need for immediate action are strong indicators of stress."
"I am not even sure what to say. My girlfriend was really, really mad. Not at my family, they're just basing this off what they hear, but at my sister. And honestly, I am really mad too. What the fuck could she be saying about me?",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and frustration. the individual's confusion and distress about their girlfriend's anger and the potential negative comments made by their sister indicate a heightened state of stress. the use of strong language and repeated emphasis on being ""really mad"" suggests an intense emotional response. the uncertainty and questioning of what might have been said about them highlight a preoccupation with perceived threats to their reputation or relationships, which are common stress indicators. the narrative's tone and content reveal an underlying struggle with managing interpersonal conflicts and the associated emotional impact."
"Hi Everyone, I've been dating my GF for about 10 months, and everything is pretty good with the relationship. I think the two biggest weaknesses are my clinginess and her sometimes-poor communication skills. I like to express how I feel, and I'd much rather talk about the elephant in the room, whereas she likes to sweep things under the rug. We met at college, and her girlfriends from school have a group of guy friends.",0,"the narrative reflects a generally positive and stable relationship, with the individual acknowledging minor issues but not expressing significant distress. the writer describes their relationship as ""pretty good"" and mentions specific weaknesses like clinginess and poor communication skills, but these are presented in a constructive manner rather than a distressing one. the individual's willingness to discuss problems openly and their partner's tendency to avoid conflict are framed as differences in communication styles rather than sources of major stress. the mention of meeting at college and having mutual friends suggests a normal social context, further indicating a lack of overwhelming stress. overall, the narrative's tone is calm and reflective, with an emphasis on understanding and addressing minor relationship dynamics, which are typical in many healthy relationships."
"He grew from a short, stubby, orange haired, freckle faced, awkward boy into a seemingly strong, tattooed, pierced, tall, ginger, man I thought I always wanted. From the time I was 13, I thought he loved me. I didn't know why, but he told me often; on the phone, through letter. I was the girl he thought he could never get. I was out of his league (his words).",0,"the narrative describes a journey of personal growth and transformation, detailing the physical and emotional changes of an individual over time. the writer reflects on their relationship with this person, highlighting a long-standing connection that began in adolescence. the tone of the narrative is reflective and somewhat nostalgic, focusing on the evolution of the boy into a man who matched the writer's ideal. there are no explicit signs of distress or anxiety; instead, the narrative conveys a sense of admiration and fondness. the mention of being told they were out of his league suggests a positive reinforcement of self-worth. overall, the narrative lacks elements typically associated with stress, such as expressions of worry, fear, or tension. the writer's focus on growth, transformation, and positive self-perception aligns more with a narrative of reminiscence rather than one of stress."
"And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks. So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day. So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it. I just can't fucking win. I'm so so tired.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of distress and psychological turmoil, which are clear indicators of stress. the mention of ""nightmares"" that involve ""intense body horror and trauma flashbacks"" suggests ongoing and severe disturbances in sleep, a common symptom in individuals experiencing high levels of stress and trauma. waking up ""even more tired and in pain"" highlights the physical toll that stress can take on the body, exacerbating feelings of misery throughout the day. the chronic pain flare-ups and the resurgence of ptsd symptoms further illustrate the overwhelming nature of the stress the individual is facing. the reference to other mental illnesses ""acting up"" and the sheer exhaustion from the nightmares point to a compounded effect, where multiple stressors are interacting and worsening the individual's overall mental health. the phrase ""i just cannot fucking win"" conveys a deep sense of helplessness and frustration, which are emotional states frequently associated with high stress levels. finally, the repeated emphasis on being ""so so tired"" underscores the pervasive impact of stress on both mental and physical energy, leaving the individual feeling drained and incapable of managing their condition effectively."
"I can get from feeling super bad (aka anxiety) to feeling super good with just one single thought (they're, most of the times, exaggerated). And then, with another thought I can get from feeling super good to feeling super bad. This is a matter of just seconds and these switchs can last for hours, stop and then come back again. When I get the bad feelings it's just awful and the only way I can cope with them is thinking of a way of killing myself. Then, when I get the good ones, I completely forget about the sensation the bad ones gave me and I see the bright side.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing rapid and intense mood swings, which are characteristic indicators of stress and possibly other mental health issues such as anxiety or bipolar disorder. the individual mentions fluctuating between extreme emotional states within seconds, which suggests a lack of emotional stability and control. the mention of suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanism for the bad feelings is a significant red flag and indicates severe distress. the narrative also highlights a stark contrast between the 'super bad' and 'super good' feelings, pointing to a potential inability to maintain a balanced emotional state. these descriptions reflect a high level of psychological turmoil and are consistent with someone experiencing significant stress."
"We could make the money up but by that point the next rent check will be due. We managed to borrow $450 from friends/family but that's all we can get.

We will repay when we can recover from this blow.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving financial difficulty and the need for support, but the tone and content suggest a composed and hopeful outlook. the author acknowledges the challenge but remains solution-focused, highlighting the efforts already made to secure funds and expressing gratitude and humility in their request for additional help. there is no mention of overwhelming anxiety, despair, or other emotional distress that typically accompanies stress. instead, the narrative reflects a pragmatic approach and a sense of control over the situation, which are not indicative of significant stress."
It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing. Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing. These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling. Is this feeling common? I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of stress. the author describes a significant life change—moving home due to family circumstances—which they did not desire, suggesting a lack of control over the situation, a common stressor. the repeated mention of anxiety and questioning whether they are making the right decision highlights their internal conflict and uncertainty, both of which are strong markers of stress. the expression of a ""really dark awful feeling"" further underscores the emotional distress they are experiencing. the author's attempt to rationalize their feelings by questioning if it's intuition versus anxiety shows their struggle to understand and manage their emotions, a typical reaction in stressful situations. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that reflect psychological stress, such as life disruptions, feelings of anxiety, emotional turmoil, and cognitive dissonance."
"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old. I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups. 1.5 hour swimming sessions (4k yards) 6 days a week with a 30 minute dryland practice everyday or every other day, I believe. I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes a long history of extreme depression and anxiety, starting from a young age, which are strong markers of psychological stress. the context of competitive swimming, with its rigorous and demanding schedule, exacerbates these issues. the mention of 1.5-hour swimming sessions, covering 4k yards, six days a week, combined with additional dryland practices, suggests a highly stressful environment. the individual also mentions feeling completely overwhelmed after being placed in a more demanding group, highlighting a significant increase in stress levels. the chronic nature of their mental health issues and the pressure from the competitive swimming environment are clear indicators of sustained stress."
"Hi, this is my first Reddit post. I have searched the internet regarding anxiety in online gaming and there seem to be people who have it. That's kind of a relief for me. I would like to play with people with these issues, because I imagine that I'll feel a certain level of comfort knowing that we have the same issue.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of curiosity and relief rather than stress. the author acknowledges their anxiety in online gaming but does so in a matter-of-fact manner, indicating self-awareness and a proactive approach to their situation. the mention of finding others with similar issues and the desire to connect with them suggests a positive coping strategy and a search for social support, which are healthy responses. the tone of the narrative is calm and solution-oriented, lacking signs of overwhelming distress or urgency. this indicates that while the author is aware of their anxiety, they are not currently experiencing high levels of stress."
"Over the past couple of years I've been getting increasingly afraid of road trips. I've been terrified of dying in car accidents. I don't know entirely knowing where this fear is coming from. I was in a super minor fender bender as a teenager but that was it. In college, I lived in a city with insane traffic and regular accidents but I never experienced an accident myself.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant fear of road trips and car accidents, which has been escalating over the past few years. this increasing fear, despite the absence of any major traumatic event, is a key indicator of stress. the writer mentions a minor fender bender in their teenage years and living in a city with heavy traffic and frequent accidents during college, yet they did not experience any serious incidents. this discrepancy between their fear and their actual experiences suggests that their anxiety is disproportionate and possibly irrational, which is a common symptom of stress. the uncertainty about the origin of their fear further emphasizes their distress, as they are unable to pinpoint a specific cause, leading to a heightened state of anxiety. these elements collectively point to the presence of underlying stress affecting their perception and emotional responses."
This isn’t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place. I’ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year I’m full on depressed. I’ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those I’m trying to leave. I’ve never self harmed (thankfully) but I’m always bummed out and paranoid. College is surprisingly the only thing that doesn’t make me anxious.,1,"the narrative presents several indicators of stress, primarily through the expression of long-term anxiety and recent onset of depression. the individual mentions having had anxiety for a few years, which suggests a chronic condition contributing to their stress levels. the statement about considering running away multiple times highlights a sense of desperation and an overwhelming need to escape their current situation, both of which are common in stressed individuals. the mention of feeling bad for those they would leave behind indicates a conflict between their desire to escape and their sense of responsibility or guilt, further compounding their stress. the absence of self-harm is a positive note, but the continuous feelings of being ""bummed out and paranoid"" point to a pervasive negative emotional state. interestingly, the narrative mentions that college does not induce anxiety, which could suggest it serves as a coping mechanism or a source of stability amidst their overall stress. these elements collectively depict a person under significant stress, dealing with complex emotional and psychological challenges."
"Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him, I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways. Especially with my depression and stuff he deals with a lot of household stuff in addition to working way more than I do. I feel like shit for writing this post. **TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me. Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is, what can I do about it?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep internal conflict and emotional turmoil, which are common indicators of stress. the writer expresses feelings of guilt and self-reproach for wanting more from their partner despite acknowledging the partner's significant contributions and support. this dichotomy of emotions—appreciation mixed with guilt and resentment—can be incredibly taxing on one's mental state. the mention of depression further complicates the emotional landscape, suggesting an ongoing struggle with mental health that is exacerbated by the current relationship dynamics. the writer's concern about potential emotional abuse indicates a heightened state of anxiety and confusion, which are also typical signs of stress. the repetitive use of strong, negative language such as ""feel awful,"" ""feel like shit,"" and ""guilty as fuck"" underscores the intensity of their emotional distress. overall, the narrative is laden with indicators of stress, including self-doubt, guilt, and the strain of managing complex emotions within a challenging relationship."
"I also get really painful cramps/periods every month. I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business! Today, I asked to leave at lunch time, because I was in a lot of pain, I had terrible cramps, and actually bled through my pants! Embarrassing! The secretary told me it was no problem.",1,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences significant physical pain due to menstrual cramps, which is a notable stressor. the reluctance to share this information with colleagues, fearing it might be seen as complaining, indicates a potential internalization of stress and a desire to avoid perceived judgment. the event of bleeding through their pants and the embarrassment associated with it further highlight the acute stress experienced. asking to leave work early due to pain and the physical symptoms described are strong indicators of distress. the individual's experience of embarrassment and the need to manage a painful and personal situation in a professional setting are typical indicators of stress."

I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of distress and anxiety, as evidenced by the constant fear and flashbacks from ptsd. the imagery of a home filled with spider and insect memories suggests intrusive and distressing thoughts that are difficult to escape. the feeling of isolation is palpable, with the individual expressing that few people in their life can handle their situation, which compounds their sense of loneliness. the apology and the need to write down their feelings to try and stop crying indicate a significant emotional burden and a cry for help. these elements are typical indicators of stress, particularly the overwhelming fear, intrusive memories, and profound sense of isolation."

Also i know there is a big age gap, i am 23 and he is 39 but i have connected with him in ways i never connected with anyone else, and both my previous relationships of 3 and 1 year was with guys that were 11 and 13 years older than me, i just like older men and i am more comfortable with them. Could all this feelings be wrong? Could it be because i have no one here and i found comfort with him to be the reason i developed feelings for him?

Any ideas on what to do? thanks.",1,"the narrative indicates significant distress and hopelessness. the author mentions an inability to function due to a hostile living situation, which is a clear sign of environmental stress. the statement about barely keeping themselves from suicide is a severe indicator of emotional and psychological strain. the fear of abuse in residential care facilities and the potential for further deterioration of their mental state highlight a pervasive sense of fear and mistrust. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress, as the individual feels trapped in their current circumstances without viable solutions. the plea for ideas on what to do underscores their desperation and need for support, which are common in individuals experiencing intense stress."

The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short. I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing heightened anxiety and stress over changes in their relationship dynamics. specific indicators of stress include obsessive behaviors like checking social media activity and snapchat scores, which are attempts to gain reassurance and control. the individual's fixation on shorter texts and lack of regular communication from their partner exacerbates their anxiety, leading to feelings of insecurity and fear of abandonment. the narrative also mentions a direct confrontation about these issues, which was met with hostility, further intensifying the individual's stress. these behaviors and emotional responses are typical indicators of stress, especially in the context of relationship uncertainty and perceived rejection."

"He did threaten to walk out when I tried to crack a third, and I stopped. He says this is so rewarding for him, but is really open about how tough it has been as well. The therapist, though she is more closed mouthed and less personally emotional, has said she has required supervision several times over me.

I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.

"Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?"" I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse.

"If you withhold financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it out of you somehow. Trust me. It isn't pretty.

"My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated. I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage). He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline. For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed. When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the author's husband exhibits poor impulse control, particularly when he is angry or frustrated. this behavior is directed towards their dog, who is already challenging to manage due to its background as a rescue. specific examples include pulling the leash too hard and over-disciplining the dog, such as causing the dog to fall out of the car. these actions, while not physically abusive, indicate a high level of frustration and inability to manage stress constructively. the author's concern about her husband's behavior and the impact on the dog further suggests an environment where stress is a significant factor. the husband's acknowledgment of his poor impulse control also points to a self-awareness of his stress-induced actions, which can be typical in individuals experiencing ongoing stress."
"I don’t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when I’m not coping or in a state, I feel like it’s something I have to ride out on my own, that I can’t tell anyone about. I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps. Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go. So It’s been largely untreated, not throw lack of trying. I can’t see my condition changing.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author expresses feelings of isolation and a belief that they must endure their struggles alone, which is a common stress response. they mention difficulty coping and an aversion to seeking help, despite multiple attempts with therapists, indicating a sense of hopelessness and frustration. the reference to not wanting to see their mother cry suggests a deep emotional burden and guilt, which are often associated with stress. the avoidance behavior, such as hiding to avoid appointments, further illustrates significant anxiety and distress. these elements collectively highlight a state of persistent stress and emotional turmoil."
"After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman. He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.",1,"the narrative reflects significant worry and concern, which are typical indicators of stress. the author expresses ongoing anxiety about the potential harm to others, specifically another woman who is now dating the same man. the detailed recounting of past abuse and the fear of its recurrence highlight a preoccupation with the safety and well-being of others, which can be a source of chronic stress. the desire for preventative measures, such as an online database, further illustrates a sense of helplessness and frustration, common emotions experienced by individuals under stress. the narrative's focus on the inability to control or prevent future abuse underscores the persistent and pervasive nature of the author's distress."
"I didn't have time to text a lot like I used to, and certainly couldn't realistically plan trips to see her anymore. She was plainly unhappy with me for not being as communicative anymore, but things really came to a head when I began dating someone. Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community. She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa). As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0,"the narrative describes a shift in social dynamics and relationships, specifically detailing changes in communication patterns and reactions to new romantic developments. while there are mentions of disappointment and distancing from a friend, these elements are conveyed in a straightforward manner without significant emotional distress. the author acknowledges lisa's unhappiness and the subsequent distancing but does not express personal turmoil or overwhelming anxiety about these changes. instead, the narrative maintains a tone of observation and recounting events, which suggests a level of emotional detachment. this lack of intense emotional reaction or signs of pervasive worry and tension are typical indicators that the individual is not experiencing significant stress. the narrative focuses more on describing the situational changes rather than delving into personal feelings of stress or anxiety."
"I've been struggling to work/be employed ever since my first job gave me anxiety 6 years ago but I feel like only now I've finally cracked it. In December I managed to work on a contract full time in an office for 6 weeks with only 1 massive panic attack. But now, I'm about to have 3 part time jobs. They're not the sort of jobs I would love to have \(I kind of want a job where I can talk to other people in the workplace\) but I found that social media/community manager gigs are so flexible and are working at home jobs. So I stay anxiety free by setting my own hours and being in control, and I make more money than I would have if I worked at a cafe or at a restaurant.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced significant anxiety related to employment in the past but has recently found a way to manage it effectively. the person highlights a recent success in maintaining a full-time contract job with minimal anxiety, indicating progress in coping mechanisms. they also mention securing three part-time jobs that, while not ideal in terms of social interaction, provide flexibility and control over their schedule. this control seems to be a crucial factor in their ability to remain anxiety-free. the narrative suggests a level of self-awareness and proactive problem-solving, which are positive indicators of managing stress. overall, the individual appears to be in a stable and controlled state, having found a balance that minimizes stress triggers and enhances their well-being."

The sentencing will be soon and the court said he is getting probation and at the time of sentencing the no contact order will be lifted. She has not attempted to move on and is waiting for the order to be lifted in order to reunite with him.,0,"the narrative describes a serious and traumatic event involving domestic violence and the presence of a firearm, which are typically associated with high stress. however, the focus of the narrative is on the legal and procedural aspects of the situation rather than on personal emotional responses or distress. the writer provides a factual account of what has happened and what is expected to happen next, without expressing anxiety, fear, or overwhelming concern. the mention of the daughter waiting to reunite with the other party suggests a level of acceptance or normalization of the situation rather than an ongoing stress response. these aspects indicate that while the circumstances are severe, the narrative itself does not convey the emotional turmoil or cognitive disruptions that are often indicators of stress."

I often feel guilty for feeling sad or lonely because he doesn’t have anyone there. No friends (yet), family, and he misses our son terribly. He’s having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when he’s sad he gets angry.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators. the writer is dealing with the challenges of single parenting while her partner is stationed overseas, which inherently creates a sense of isolation and responsibility. the mention of feeling guilty for experiencing sadness or loneliness highlights internal conflict and emotional burden. the partner's lack of social support and his struggle with missing important milestones contribute to his depression, which in turn affects his behavior, manifesting as anger. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress, as both individuals are navigating emotional hardships and the strain of separation."

"&nbsp; SAR teams, crew and techs, go where nobody else can go.

"A lot of very helpful things can be found here, whether it’s how to get benefits and meals, to finding shelter. What I am concerned about is putting together something for the newly homeless in regards to scams, cons, users, people to avoid. Basic homeless etiquette, unwritten rules. Some of these people will have no “street smarts” or some will have very limited experiences with these situations. Most will be terrified, and could end up trusting the wrong people by not seeing signs that more “street wise” folks might have.",0,"the narrative discusses the availability of helpful resources for those in need, such as benefits, meals, and shelter. the author expresses concern for the newly homeless, emphasizing the importance of educating them about potential dangers and scams they might encounter. the focus is on providing guidance and support to those who may lack street smarts or experience, aiming to protect them from harm. the tone is proactive and empathetic, with an emphasis on practical solutions and community support. this narrative reflects a problem-solving mindset and a desire to help others navigate challenging situations, rather than indicating personal stress."
If you're stuck and too anxious to move just know that you are always making progress. It's okay to do it in your own way.

"I just never had proper doctors who could diagnose me. There's a very long story there. I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life. I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old. My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1,"the narrative reflects a history of prolonged and severe trauma, which is a significant indicator of stress. the individual mentions suffering from ptsd, a condition commonly associated with high levels of stress and anxiety. the recounting of physical abuse by a teacher at a young age and continuous abuse by a parent until the age of 16 highlights chronic exposure to stressful and harmful environments. these experiences likely contribute to ongoing psychological distress. the lack of proper medical diagnosis further exacerbates the individual's stress, as it suggests a sense of helplessness and unresolved trauma. the detailed mention of specific abusive incidents underscores the deep impact these experiences have had on the individual's mental health, making it evident that they are dealing with significant stress."
"I don't feel at all like he doesn't like me or has gone off me, we meet once a week and 'chat' daily but I'm kind of unhappy I'm not getting the 'cant get enough of talking' experience that usually comes along with being enamoured at the start. I nearly always reply within 20 mins if I'm not busy because I'm still in the excited pahse, but I get a lot of 3/4 wait times with a read receipt, with him coming on and off whatsapp within that period before I get a reply.

I'm his new potential gf!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of dissatisfaction and slight frustration regarding the dynamics of a budding relationship. the author expresses a desire for more frequent and enthusiastic communication, which is typical at the start of a romantic relationship. however, despite these feelings, the overall tone lacks the intensity and pervasive worry that typically characterizes someone under significant stress. the author is observant and analytical about the partner's behavior, yet there is no indication of overwhelming anxiety or distress. the narrative instead suggests mild disappointment and a yearning for more engagement rather than the heightened emotional turmoil often seen in stressed individuals. this perspective aligns with a common experience of unmet expectations in new relationships but does not reach the level of acute stress."
"The truth that sometimes there is nothing more you can do but mitigate the symptoms of your PTSD. That psychotherapy, DBT, CBT and all manner of psychological sciences have limits.

That scientists neither really understand what neurological mechanisms which cause PTSD, nor how the medications they use to treat it work.",0,"the narrative discusses the limitations and challenges in treating ptsd, acknowledging that psychotherapy, dbt, cbt, and medications have their boundaries. while the tone is somber and realistic, it does not convey personal distress or immediate emotional turmoil. instead, it presents a rational and informed perspective on the complexities of mental health treatment. the author appears to be reflecting on the general state of psychological sciences and their limitations, rather than expressing personal suffering or stress. this detached and analytical approach suggests a level of acceptance and understanding rather than an emotional response typical of someone experiencing stress."
"I had no insurance but got expensive tests run to confirm that I was not having seizures. When that therapist suggested crystal healing I left and went to another one. After over six different therapists/psychiatrists I have received yet another diagnosis of PTSD, schizophrenia with mania, anxiety disorder, and depression.

Im so in love with my wife when she’s happy and herself. We have everything in common. But when she becomes abusive and manipulative it’s too much and she says she will change and she’s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I don’t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if it’s real?

I'm scared, and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this, he was served a protective order way back in October 2017. Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police? It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress through several indicators. the author expresses fear and frustration, as seen in the phrases ""i am scared"" and ""almost annoyed of dealing with this."" the mention of a protective order and the confusion about its effectiveness suggest ongoing anxiety and concern for personal safety. the reference to potential corruption (""whether he is paying them off"") adds a layer of distrust and paranoia, which are common in stressful situations. the author's plea for additional steps to take indicates a feeling of helplessness and desperation, further highlighting their stressed state. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant stress due to unresolved and persistent issues."

"You try harder to focus on the screen when another turns on. The screen is large enough that you can clearly make out that it is most definitely a memory.

As you watch, you realize that you aren't watching anymore- you are in the memory again.",0,"the narrative describes an experience of trying to focus on a screen that displays a memory, which becomes increasingly vivid and immersive. the progression of screens turning on and the eventual immersion into the memory suggests a reflective or imaginative state rather than a stressed one. there are no indications of distress, anxiety, or overwhelming emotions typically associated with stress. instead, the narrative conveys a sense of curiosity and engagement with the memory, which are not characteristic of a stressed mindset. the detailed and vivid description of the memory further implies a calm and controlled environment, rather than one filled with tension or pressure."

On top of that, he still expected sex all the time. I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the individual describes a situation where they are accused of lying and keeping secrets, which can lead to feelings of guilt, anxiety, and tension. the mention of being ""furious"" highlights a high-conflict environment, which is a significant stressor. additionally, the pressure to engage in sexual activity despite a reduced libido due to stress from moving and constant crying and fighting further underscores the emotional and physical strain the person is under. these elements collectively point to a state of distress, characterized by emotional upheaval and interpersonal conflict, both of which are common indicators of stress."
"Woke up 4 days later, intubated and paralyzed. Didn't know if I was locked in, had suffered brain damage from lack of oxygen, I had no idea what was happening. I could hear everyone. No idea how much time passed before someone noticed. The paralytics given to me to keep me comfortable were off and I could move again.",0,"the narrative describes a highly traumatic medical experience involving intubation, paralysis, and confusion about one's condition. despite the intense nature of the events, the recounting lacks expressions of ongoing distress or emotional turmoil typically associated with stress. the focus is on the sequence of events and the physical sensations rather than on the emotional impact or cognitive responses. there is an absence of language indicating persistent worry, anxiety, or hyperarousal, which are common indicators of stress. the narrative remains descriptive and factual, without delving into the personal emotional aftermath or coping difficulties that often accompany stressful experiences. this suggests that while the events were undoubtedly severe, the individual recounting them does not exhibit the psychological markers typically associated with experiencing stress."

Anyway, thanks for listening, and for what it's worth, please everyone have a safe holiday.",1,"the narrative is filled with overwhelming distress and frustration, which are clear indicators of stress. the author describes multiple severe challenges, including homelessness, health issues, legal troubles, and dealing with ineffective social services. the mention of being terrified due to health problems and the prolonged legal battle to prove innocence highlights significant anxiety and helplessness. the description of living conditions, such as staying in a place as cold as a refrigerator and now being back on the streets with moldy gear, further underscores the dire circumstances. the physical symptoms of being sick and in pain, coupled with the fear of violence and societal hostility, amplify the sense of desperation and hopelessness. the use of strong language and the need to vent suggest a high level of emotional turmoil. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant stress."

But at the same time I'm one of her exes, is it really my fight to take? tl;dr: Ex probably cheated on her new boyfriend with me, should i tell him or just stay out of it?",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is dealing with a complex interpersonal relationship, but there are no clear indicators of significant stress. the person is contemplating whether to inform someone about a potential infidelity, which involves some moral and ethical considerations. however, the tone of the narrative suggests that the individual is more focused on decision-making rather than experiencing acute stress. the language used is relatively calm and rational, with the person weighing the pros and cons of their potential actions. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or cognitive impairments that are typically associated with stress. instead, the narrative centers around a logical deliberation about what the right course of action might be, indicating a state of contemplation rather than distress."
"If you haven't outgrown that by your early 20s, I think there's possibly a problem. She thinks these comment wars she gets into are funny, and turning people's words around on them and baiting them is her idea of having fun. She's delighted when someone gets mad at her. I don't see how this can be fun to anyone unless they have a teenager's mindset. She does this on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook mainly.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and concern, which are indicative of stress. the author describes behaviors that they find problematic and immature, such as engaging in comment wars and baiting others for amusement. the repeated mention of these actions across multiple social media platforms suggests a pervasive issue that the author is grappling with. the use of phrases like ""i think there is possibly a problem"" and ""i do not see how this can be fun"" conveys a feeling of distress and confusion about the situation. these expressions highlight the author's emotional response and the mental strain caused by observing these behaviors. the narrative's focus on negative interactions and the impact they have on the author are clear indicators of stress."
"Hello r/ptsd. I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15. Earlier this year, I noticed that I had terrible body odor (I shower and wear deodorant everyday) whenever I left the house. This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks. After talking to my psychiatrist and a therapist, they diagnosed me.",1,"the narrative describes a young individual who has endured significant traumatic events during their formative years, which is a strong indicator of chronic stress and potential post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the mention of terrible body odor despite maintaining personal hygiene suggests somatic symptoms, which are often associated with anxiety and stress. the unbearable anxiety and severe panic attacks further reinforce the presence of acute stress responses. consulting with a psychiatrist and therapist, leading to a diagnosis, indicates that the symptoms were severe enough to seek professional help. these elements collectively highlight the individual's struggle with stress and its profound impact on their daily life."
"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family. I felt I had to protect them; They were already insolved with CPS (Trust me, though, they're awesome) and I knew if i brought abuse into our case, I would inevitably send them down an unnecessary path. Social workers don't blame the abuser, they jump to the conclusion of negligent parents; Parents who were irresponsible enough to not know this was going on. They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know. I went out for a few hours and they assumed I was hanging out with my friends, at least that's what I planned to do; They assumed I went to school and got an education, not beatings when the teacher was out of the room.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and responsibility, common indicators of stress. the author describes withholding critical information from their family to protect them, indicating a heavy emotional burden. the involvement with cps and the fear of further complications highlight a stressful environment. the mention of abuse and the perception of social workers as judgmental rather than supportive further exacerbates feelings of anxiety and helplessness. the contrast between the author's reality and their family's assumptions about their activities underscores a significant disconnect and internal struggle. such elements, including the need to conceal the truth and the experience of physical abuse, are clear signs of a stressful and distressing situation."
The best idea i have came up with is use the lazt of my petrol to get somewhere atleazt half close to work and safe and legal to park up where i canalso sleep. Use my anti bactiral gel to clean my body and just wear a hat all week for work and wait it out until friday. Does anyone else have any better advice? Id appriciate any suggestions. Thank you,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, as evidenced by the writer's focus on basic survival strategies and immediate problem-solving related to their living situation. the individual discusses using the last of their petrol to find a place to park and sleep, highlighting a sense of urgency and desperation. the mention of using antibacterial gel to clean their body and wearing a hat all week to work suggests they are struggling with hygiene and appearance, which are common stressors when basic needs are not met. the plea for advice and expression of appreciation for suggestions indicate a feeling of being overwhelmed and seeking support, both of which are typical emotional responses to stress. overall, the narrative portrays a situation where the individual is coping with significant stressors related to their living and working conditions."
But right now i am scared. Tl/Dr: my kids and I are about to lose our apartment due to a sudden loss of income. Need help in the next few days to make the rent. Please help. Need at least $440 to make it,1,"the narrative expresses a sense of fear and urgency, which are common indicators of stress. the author mentions being scared and the imminent threat of losing their apartment, which suggests a significant life stressor. the mention of a sudden loss of income further exacerbates the situation, indicating financial instability. the plea for help and the specific amount needed to cover rent highlights the desperation and immediate need for resolution. these elements, including the fear for their children's well-being and the potential loss of their home, are strong indicators of acute stress. the combination of financial strain, fear of homelessness, and concern for dependents all contribute to a high-stress scenario."
"Well, I've been homeless for two weeks and one day. I'm homeless this time because a woman that I had previously worked for, had promised me, and I quote, ""A lot of hours."" out in Tampa. I know that with three people, the drive from where I was at, would be worth it. We would make a lot more then what it was cost in gas, so it wasn't a problem.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual has been homeless for a little over two weeks, which is inherently stressful. the person mentions a broken promise of ""a lot of hours"" of work, indicating a reliance on this promise for stability and financial security. the disappointment and resulting homelessness from this broken promise suggest a significant emotional and psychological toll. the mention of calculating the cost of gas and the potential earnings shows a preoccupation with financial matters, often a stress indicator. the narrative conveys a sense of betrayal and uncertainty about the future, both of which are strong markers of stress. the overall context of homelessness, combined with the specific details of unmet expectations and financial concerns, strongly suggests that the individual is experiencing considerable stress."
"I can't stop feeling miserable. It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life. I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want. I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case. I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, evident through the expression of persistent negative emotions and feelings of helplessness. the individual mentions feeling ""miserable"" and unable to stop these feelings, which is a clear sign of emotional distress. the reference to an ex ""going crazy"" and the sense of loss of control over their own life suggests a chaotic personal situation contributing to their stress. the mention of the prosecutor's comments and the confusion about what was agreed upon further highlights cognitive dissonance and self-doubt, common in stressed individuals. the writer's admission of not doing as well as they thought and feeling ""crazy"" points to a significant internal struggle and a negative self-assessment, both of which are classic symptoms of stress. these elements collectively illustrate the individual's overwhelmed state and difficulty coping with their circumstances."
"We are 21 now, both turning 22 next month. It started off as friendly catching up, but things have gotten more romantic and we have been hanging out a lot more. I wasn’t sure we could ever be together again, but I no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment regarding what he did to me. I have noticed by the way he carries himself now, he has definitely matured. I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him I hooked up with his friends?",0,"the narrative reflects a calm and introspective tone, indicating a person who is not currently experiencing significant stress. the individual describes a positive progression in their relationship, moving from friendly interactions to more romantic ones, which suggests a sense of optimism and emotional stability. the mention of not feeling sadness or resentment about past events indicates emotional resolution and maturity. the observation of the other person's maturity also points to a thoughtful and reflective mindset. while there is a question about disclosing a past action, it is posed in a curious rather than anxious manner, indicating a level of comfort and control over the situation. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is in a relatively stress-free state."
"I turned 15 shortly after meeting him. He started out so kind and loving. And then it just... turned. It turned from compliments into me not being able to wear certain things, say certain things, do certain things. I was barely allowed to be online, no longer able to post anything relating to the music I used to create before him.",0,"the narrative describes a relationship that started positively but gradually became controlling and restrictive. while these experiences can be distressing, the focus is on the changes in behavior and restrictions imposed by another person rather than on the internal emotional state of the narrator. the narrative lacks explicit expressions of stress, anxiety, or emotional turmoil that are typically indicative of someone experiencing stress. the recounting of events is more factual and descriptive rather than emotive. the absence of language that conveys overwhelming stress or emotional distress suggests that the individual is reflecting on past events rather than actively experiencing stress."
"And then a short moment after i fell asleep i get quite a lot text messages, that at least another dude do want her to sleep over, that im a shit guy, and so on. I honestly dont think i can live long with this, but i do care about her and want to do something back for her. I was pretty much done with my live and lost all fate and interest in things. She was the one that got me back on these things. And beside these moments i have a good time with her aswell.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences moments of distress, particularly related to receiving upsetting text messages and feeling devalued by others. despite these negative experiences, the individual expresses a deep care for another person and acknowledges that this relationship has rekindled their interest in life and provided positive experiences. the mention of having good times alongside moments of distress suggests a balance in their emotional state. this ability to find joy and maintain a meaningful connection with someone indicates resilience and the presence of positive coping mechanisms. the narrative does not solely focus on negative emotions but also highlights the importance of the supportive relationship, which can be a significant protective factor against stress."
"he was my best friend since highschool, she was a girl i really liked. my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out, and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back. im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now. there were some not so nice comments going back and forth. the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months, but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating, his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions.",0,"the narrative describes a series of interpersonal conflicts and betrayals, yet the tone remains relatively detached and factual. the author recounts significant events, such as a friend living at their house, dating someone they liked, and subsequent fallout, without delving deeply into their emotional state. while there are mentions of ""not so nice comments"" and a serious allegation of physical abuse, the author's presentation lacks the intensity and personal distress typically associated with stress. the focus is on recounting events rather than expressing feelings of anxiety, sadness, or anger, which are common indicators of stress. the narrative's calm and measured tone suggests a level of emotional distance from the events described, indicating that the author may not be experiencing significant stress."
"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through multiple aspects. the author describes a longstanding struggle with their therapist, feeling that the repeated advice was ineffective and sometimes detrimental. the mention of the mind tearing itself apart and focusing on past failures indicates a high level of rumination and negative self-talk, both common in stressed individuals. the decision to stop therapy and medication, driven by financial constraints and exacerbated by the father's departure, underscores the presence of external stressors. the detailed recounting of the deteriorating living conditions—losing heating, water, gas, and electricity—paints a picture of escalating hardship and instability, further contributing to the stress. the combination of ineffective therapeutic support, financial strain, and worsening living conditions are all typical indicators of significant stress."
The next time I went to see her after that she said sorry if I wasn’t my self last time and I just said that she seemed tired and so I started to see her earlier in the day. Even from the first few time I went to see her she would always talk about herself. I didn’t have a problem with it because I am shy and so bad at conversation it kind of took the spot light off of me even tho that’s kinda what I was there to see her for. Also from the beginning she was kinda well very unprofessional and I knew this. I had just started to see a psychiatrist and I had told her what medications weren’t working for me so she gave me some of hers to try and see if they worked.,0,"the narrative describes an interaction with a psychiatrist where the author notes unprofessional behavior and a lack of focus on their needs. despite these issues, the author does not express any significant emotional distress or anxiety about the situation. instead, they seem to accept the circumstances and adapt to them, such as by scheduling appointments earlier in the day. the author's casual tone and lack of urgency or frustration suggest a level of detachment and acceptance rather than stress. they even mention feeling relieved that the psychiatrist's self-focused conversations took the spotlight off them, indicating a preference for avoiding direct attention rather than a reaction stemming from stress."
"For the record, my partner hasn't brought this up as an issue but of course being turned down sucks and it's been like this since the beginning. I thought with time I'd relax but it wasn't a question of relaxing. To make things worse, nine times out of ten that we do have sex is because I initiate. That is not because he never does, that is how much I turn him down. I know this seems stupid since most posts here are about how to survive but maybe a random post about improvement can be acceptable?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and contemplation rather than acute distress. the individual discusses their relationship dynamics in a calm and rational manner, acknowledging the issue without displaying overwhelming anxiety or emotional turmoil. the mention of their partner not bringing up the issue indicates an absence of conflict or significant tension. the writer's introspection about their own behavior and the desire for improvement suggest a proactive and thoughtful approach rather than one driven by stress. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, negativity, and emotional intensity typically associated with stress."
"Fast forward to 3 am, I am tired and would rather just leave, even though we have convenient seats in a standing room only club and my wife is enjoying herself. She makes a passing comment that she would likely be more comfortable at home, eating food. I jump on this and say we should walk back even though it is a 45-minute walk, in heels, in the rain (which I did not check for). She agrees we leave, she slips and falls, I did not help her up, and we fight the entire way home, divorce comes up several times. This morning she won't get out of bed and won't talk to me.",1,"the narrative illustrates several indicators of stress. the individual describes a situation where they are physically tired and in a social setting they would rather leave, highlighting a sense of discomfort and impatience. the tension escalates when the wife expresses a mild preference for being at home, which the individual seizes upon, suggesting an impulsive decision to leave despite the challenging conditions of a long walk in the rain. the subsequent fall and lack of assistance from the individual exacerbate the situation, leading to an argument where divorce is mentioned multiple times, indicating a significant level of relational conflict and emotional strain. the next morning, the wife's refusal to get out of bed or communicate further underscores the severity of the stress experienced by both parties. these elements, including physical exhaustion, impulsive decisions, relational conflict, and withdrawal, are all typical indicators of stress."
"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out. I got a little excited, found a huge box and was able to move on with my day.. until about 3 when the owner came over, moved it, and then asked me if I was keeping it for anything. I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative. Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity. I guess I have a new trigger.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress. the individual describes feeling the need to ""gather their composure"" and ""sulked"" after an initial incident, suggesting an emotional struggle. the use of words like ""negative,"" ""stupid me,"" and ""trigger"" highlights a sense of frustration and self-criticism. the interaction with the owner, who dismisses the individual's feelings and questions their suitability for the job, likely exacerbates the stress. this scenario of invalidation and conflict at work is a common stressor, leading to feelings of helplessness and anxiety. the person's reaction to the signs and the subsequent confrontation further illustrate a heightened sensitivity and emotional response, both typical in stressed individuals."
"Well Reddit, I don't even know where to begin... I guess I will start at the start of my relationship with my now wife and mother of my beautiful little girl. Our relationship came on suddenly and the surprise that is my daughter came on extremely surprisingly to me. I was already 36 years old and had been in several long term serious relationships that for one reason or another ended prior to marriage and I had long since just assumed I was incapable of fathering a child. I was years past all the stages of grief on the subject.",0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on their relationship and the unexpected arrival of their daughter. while the individual mentions being surprised by the pregnancy, they do not express feelings of distress or anxiety. instead, they focus on the positive aspects, such as their beautiful little girl and their current relationship with their wife. the tone is more reflective and matter-of-fact rather than anxious or overwhelmed. there is no indication of ongoing stress or negative emotions related to their current situation. the mention of having moved past the stages of grief regarding fatherhood suggests a resolution and acceptance of their past experiences, further indicating a lack of current stress."

He really wanted her to go with her to Chile.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where b is expressing his desire for companionship and romantic interest in someone. the individual in question appears to be conflicted, which can be a normal response to such a proposal, especially when it involves significant decisions like traveling or engaging in a romantic relationship. however, there are no clear indicators of stress such as overwhelming anxiety, depressive thoughts, or a sense of being unable to cope. the conflict mentioned seems to be more about decision-making rather than an emotional or psychological burden. her response to the kiss and the mention of b falling for her suggest a situation that might be emotionally charged but not necessarily stressful. these elements point towards a typical scenario of navigating personal relationships rather than experiencing significant stress."

"It's not that the current one isn't helping at all, but it would be nice if it helped _more_. She's got a lot of good literature and notes and it's helped some. But it's her words that it hasn't helped as much as she would like. Just wondering if anyone with any experience in talk therapy would share anything she may be able to talk about or focus on that could help a lot? This is a new experience for her, so she might just not know what to do or say during therapy to get anywhere if the therapist isn't guiding the discussion, and I wouldn't know what to suggest either.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is seeking advice on how to make the most out of talk therapy. while there is an acknowledgment that the current therapy has provided some benefits, there is a desire for greater improvement. the tone of the narrative is inquisitive and open to suggestions rather than displaying signs of distress or anxiety. the individual appears to be proactive in seeking solutions and willing to learn from others' experiences. this openness to exploring new strategies and the lack of urgent or overwhelming emotional language are indicators that the person is not experiencing significant stress. instead, they are engaged in a thoughtful and measured approach to enhancing their therapeutic experience."

"My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'. Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer... But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry. The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state, let alone 'finished' and sellable.

I often find myself wishing she would break up with me.",1,"the narrative presents several clear indicators of stress. the individual describes their last year of grad school, a period often associated with significant academic pressure and uncertainty about the future. living alone without strong friendships exacerbates feelings of isolation and loneliness, common stressors. the mention of their dad dying of cancer since september introduces a profound emotional burden and anticipatory grief, both potent sources of stress. additionally, the initial excitement about getting married has shifted to dread and worry over the past three months, indicating a significant change in emotional state. the visits to their partner resulting in a deep funk and the wish for a breakup further highlight a pervasive sense of despair and emotional turmoil. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress, as the individual grapples with multiple significant life challenges simultaneously."

I am indian and he is white. I have been in the US since I was 6 and if you ever spoke with me on the phone, you would never be able to guess that I am indian.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes an obsessive thought pattern, indicating persistent rumination, which is a common symptom of stress. despite attempts to maintain a positive outlook, negative emotions surface, particularly in social settings involving alcohol, suggesting that the stress is difficult to manage and often leads to emotional outbursts such as crying alone. the relationship dynamics with the boyfriend add to the stress, as his comments about the individual's weight and his history of breaking up with her create a sense of insecurity and self-doubt. the boyfriend's contradictory behavior—expressing love and admiration while also being critical—likely exacerbates feelings of confusion and emotional turmoil. additionally, the mention of cultural identity and the sense of not fitting in, despite long-term residence in the us, suggests an underlying stress related to cultural assimilation and identity. these elements collectively highlight a significant level of psychological distress and emotional strain."
"She was unemployed and toyed with the idea of answering ads from strangers to perform fetish tasks for money, to include nudity (but no sex). It really wrecked me that she would consider that. She brought it up once again not too long ago (not seriously) and I flipped out. She was working as a nanny for a long time and I was very insecure about her and her boss because of my fear that she would be willing to do sex work for money.

My mother isn't that bad, but my father is the worst.",0,"the narrative reveals a complex relationship with the parents, highlighting both positive and negative experiences. the individual acknowledges the support and care provided, such as having a home, being well-fed, and having personal possessions. they also recount significant emotional support during a traumatic event, where the parents stood up for them. these positive aspects indicate a level of stability and gratitude. however, the narrative also touches on fear and self-esteem issues, particularly related to the father. despite these concerns, the balance of positive experiences and the ability to recognize and articulate both sides suggest a level of emotional processing and resilience that is not typically indicative of overwhelming stress. the individual's ability to find positives and reflect on their experiences thoughtfully is a sign of coping rather than being overwhelmed by stress."
"I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that. I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off. We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit. I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office. He came into the office all furious.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is seeking solitude and a dark, quiet environment to recover from a major trigger, which is a typical coping mechanism for someone experiencing stress. the need to isolate oneself in the bathroom with the lights off suggests an attempt to minimize sensory input, a common response to feeling overwhelmed. the loud radio in the bedroom exacerbates the situation, yet the person feels paralyzed and unable to act immediately, indicating a high level of stress and a potential freeze response. even after thinking they had calmed down, the mention of someone entering the office in a furious state adds another layer of stress, possibly reigniting or intensifying the initial distress. these elements collectively point to significant emotional and psychological strain, which are clear indicators of stress."
"I was working on this so hard and spent all of my money... and I just failed my driving test. Now the idea of retaking it gives me a panic attack. I started learning how to drive 4 years ago, and it was okay until I got this driving instructor. 90% of the time when I should be learning, he would be lookig on his phone and he would never point out any problems so I felt rather confident to finally try and get my license. In my country you first have to pass the test with your instructor and just then in an official institution.",1,"the narrative contains multiple indicators of stress, such as the author's expression of panic attacks at the thought of retaking the driving test and the significant emotional and financial investment they have already made. the frustration with the driving instructor's inattentiveness and the resultant misplaced confidence further contribute to the stress. the long duration of learning to drive, spanning four years, adds to the buildup of anxiety and pressure. the author's disappointment and sense of failure after putting in so much effort are classic signs of stress, as they indicate a significant emotional toll."
"I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened. I'm on busphar, celexa, and atomoxetine and I've been on them longer than the hallucinations and such. I don't know what to do. I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills. I don't know what to do.",1,"the narrative presents several clear indicators of stress. the individual describes a sudden onset of asthma, which can be a physical manifestation of stress. the mention of being on multiple medications such as busphar, celexa, and atomoxetine suggests ongoing treatment for mental health issues, which often correlates with high stress levels. the reference to hallucinations adds a layer of complexity and indicates severe psychological distress. the individual's uncertainty and repeated statements of not knowing what to do highlight a sense of helplessness and anxiety. additionally, the financial concerns related to seeking psychiatric help while being a college student working part-time exacerbate the stress, as financial strain is a common stressor. overall, the narrative reflects significant psychological and emotional turmoil, which aligns with the indicators of stress."
"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling. I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved? Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual discusses their need for emergency counseling and their efforts to avoid a return to the psych ward, which suggests significant emotional distress. the mention of cutting themselves after work further highlights severe coping struggles. the interaction with a colleague, where they assertively protect their privacy regarding therapy, indicates heightened sensitivity and a need for boundaries to manage their stress. their concern about how to navigate workplace relationships and whether to involve a manager also reflects anxiety about social interactions and professional repercussions. these elements collectively point to a person experiencing considerable stress, manifesting in both their actions and their expressed concerns."
"I was silent and looking in his eyes. After about 2 minutes, I got off him and headed back to my room. Just as I was getting to my door he yelled something nasty. I said something like ""Go to hell"", and got in my room and closed the door. He rushed the door and I had to use my body to keep the door closed when he bashed into the door with his body twice.",0,"the narrative describes a tense interaction between two individuals, culminating in a physical altercation at a door. while the situation itself is intense, the description lacks certain indicators that would typically suggest ongoing or chronic stress in the narrator. for example, the narrative does not mention persistent worry, feelings of being overwhelmed, or any physiological symptoms such as difficulty sleeping or changes in appetite. instead, it focuses on a specific, isolated incident. the narrator's response to the conflict appears to be reactive rather than indicative of an underlying stress condition. they describe their actions in a straightforward manner without expressing lingering fear, anxiety, or emotional distress beyond the immediate situation. these factors suggest that while the event was undoubtedly stressful, it does not reflect a broader pattern of stress in the narrator's life."
"I can't afford a treadmill and I'm not a big fan of gyms (plus there's none really nearby), so I'm trying to use really the one option available: going outside. This is a real problem for me and my anxiety. I feel like a gasping hippopotamus when I try running and am too embarrassed to let anyone see me like that, so every time I see a car or person, I stop running and immediately go back home. I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",1,"the narrative reflects a significant struggle with anxiety and stress. the individual expresses a strong desire to stay active but faces considerable barriers due to financial constraints and a lack of nearby gym facilities. their anxiety is prominently highlighted through their fear of judgment and potential harm from others, which leads to behaviors like avoiding people, running at odd hours, and stopping exercise abruptly when someone is seen. the use of phrases such as ""gasping hippopotamus"" and ""drives me insane"" indicates a high level of self-consciousness and distress. the fear of negative social evaluation and catastrophic thinking about being attacked or murdered further underscores the intensity of their stress. these elements are classic indicators of stress, particularly when related to social anxiety and safety concerns."
I’m really tired. It seems like the moment that I’m starting to recover or I’m starting to get some sort of progress. I get triggered and I have to start all over again. It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time. I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1,"the narrative contains several indicators that suggest the individual is experiencing significant stress. the expression of fatigue, ""im really tired,"" is a common symptom of stress and emotional exhaustion. the sense of repetitive struggle and lack of progress, as described by ""it seems like the moment that im starting to recover or im starting to get some sort of progress. i get triggered and i have to start all over again,"" reflects a feeling of being trapped in a cycle of stress without resolution. this can lead to feelings of hopelessness and frustration, which are often associated with chronic stress. the statement ""its so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time"" indicates a diminished sense of motivation and purpose, which are psychological effects of prolonged stress. living with an abuser, as mentioned, adds a significant source of ongoing stress and trauma, further exacerbating the individual's mental state. the occasional ability to ""make it"" suggests moments of resilience, but the overall tone of the narrative is one of struggle and emotional burden. these elements collectively point to an individual who is experiencing considerable stress."
Note: it was a mistake to sign the lease as I should have considered what would happen if 1 person lost their job. 6. I was notified 1 month after I returned home I would be laid off as the group was being shut down. (Note I did not make very much (low middle-upper lower class)). 7.,0,"the narrative reflects a retrospective acknowledgment of a mistake made in signing a lease without considering potential financial risks. despite mentioning a layoff and financial status, the tone remains factual and lacks expressions of emotional turmoil or distress. the individual seems to be recounting events in a matter-of-fact manner, focusing on the sequence of events rather than conveying feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, or panic. the absence of emotive language and the structured, almost detached way of presenting the situation suggest a level of acceptance and rational processing rather than an acute stress response. this indicates a non-stressful perspective on the described circumstances."
"He became depressed and gained a lot of weight, which makes him even more insecure about his looks. He also dropped out of university but now has come back to finish his degree. About me, I’m 21 years old, already graduated from college and now working a part time job but my goal is to become a flight attendant. I’m 162cm tall and weight 49kg, so I think it’s safe to say that I look fit. I also have a good looking face, I’m quite popular at my workplace among my coworkers and customers.",0,"the narrative describes a person who appears to be relatively content and confident in their current situation. the individual mentions being 21 years old, having already graduated from college, and working a part-time job while aspiring to become a flight attendant. they provide specific details about their physical appearance, such as their height and weight, and express satisfaction with their looks by noting they are fit and have a good-looking face. additionally, they mention being popular at their workplace among coworkers and customers, which suggests a positive social environment and self-image. these elements indicate a level of self-assurance and ambition that is generally not associated with significant stress. instead, the narrative reflects a focus on personal achievements and future goals, which are typical indicators of a non-stressful state."
"once I saw the light, saw that I didn’t even know myself anymore, I shut everything down. now, maybe it doesn’t seem like all sociopaths are this way. but they are if you let them. have the strength to say no. have the strength to be YOU.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of self-awareness and personal growth. the individual describes a realization about losing touch with their true self and taking decisive action to regain control. the tone is empowering, emphasizing strength and the ability to say no to negative influences. while the mention of sociopaths might initially suggest a darker context, the overall message is one of resilience and self-empowerment. there is no indication of overwhelming distress or inability to cope; instead, the focus is on positive change and self-assertion, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"Three of them said ""so sorry I actually can't"" and gave some noncommittal excuse, whether that was work or school related (even though school only started up again about a week ago and midterms are far away). I was disappointed but figured that it happens and I can still have fun with the three other people that are coming. Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day. I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of disappointment and frustration due to the repeated cancellations by friends, which is a common indicator of stress. the individual initially tries to stay positive but is ultimately let down again, leading to a day filled with upset emotions. the conversation with the mother adds another layer of stress by suggesting that these friendships may not be as genuine as the individual thought, causing further emotional turmoil. the feelings of isolation and questioning the authenticity of their relationships are clear signs of stress, as they contribute to a sense of insecurity and loneliness. the repetitive nature of the cancellations and the noncommittal excuses also highlight a lack of reliability in their social circle, exacerbating the individual's stress."
"Another time I had one was today in class. I was worrying about fainting because I fainted last week and didn't want it to happen again. Today I was feeling dizzy from worrying and I was thinking ""I need to get out of here."" I managed to calm myself down by taking deep breaths and closing my eyes before it got too bad. Can someone tell me if these were actually panic attacks?",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing significant anxiety and worry about fainting, a concern rooted in a recent fainting episode. this preoccupation with the possibility of fainting again indicates a heightened state of stress. the physical symptoms mentioned, such as dizziness and the urgent thought of needing to leave the situation, are classic signs of anxiety and stress. the individual's effort to calm themselves through deep breathing and closing their eyes suggests an attempt to manage their stress response, further indicating that they are actively dealing with high levels of stress. the question at the end about whether these experiences were panic attacks highlights a concern with their mental state, reinforcing the presence of stress."
I need to see that list. I can not make a decision based on evidence I can not see. Please include that list as evidence. I very much want to see it. **,0,"the narrative reflects a straightforward and logical request for information. the language used is clear and direct, with an emphasis on needing specific evidence to make an informed decision. there is no indication of emotional distress or anxiety in the tone. the repetition of the desire to see the list emphasizes the importance of transparency and clarity, rather than suggesting any underlying stress. overall, the narrative demonstrates a rational and composed approach to obtaining necessary information, which is not typically associated with stress."
"People say ""follow your gut"" but I don't even know if I have a gut feeling on this anymore because I have obfuscated it so much and overthought it to exhaustion. People have told me this is really no big deal in the long run but it feels absolutely monumental to me and will be something affecting me the rest of my life. Can any of you relate? How do you make really tough, lifelong decisions like these if you have anxiety? Thank you.",1,"the narrative expresses significant signs of stress and anxiety. the individual mentions an inability to trust their own instincts, indicative of self-doubt and overthinking, which are common symptoms of stress. the use of words like ""exhaustion"" and ""monumental"" highlights the overwhelming nature of their feelings. the person also seeks validation and advice from others, suggesting a lack of confidence in their decision-making abilities. the reference to anxiety further confirms the presence of stress, as they are struggling with making decisions that they perceive will have long-lasting impacts. these elements collectively point to a high level of distress and uncertainty."
"I don't think I have the means of moving out. I got my review in Dec. and I was supposed to get a raise if I did well, but they gave me a bonus instead and I know I should be grateful I got anything but it wasn't what I needed and I can't get another job at the moment, nothing in the area is hiring for more than what I make at the moment. But I don't know what to do with my family. Just this morning I heard my sister telling my parents, they should like her more because she is the winner and I am not. I think she was talking about jobs - she recently got hired at a private university and is making great money, has excellent benefits, and could help her get her Masters.",1,"the narrative indicates a significant level of stress experienced by the individual. the person expresses feelings of financial insecurity and uncertainty about their ability to move out, which are common stressors. the mention of a job review and the disappointment of receiving a bonus instead of a raise highlights a sense of unmet expectations and financial strain. the inability to find another job that pays more adds to the feeling of being trapped in their current situation. additionally, the family dynamics described, particularly the sister's comments about being the ""winner,"" contribute to feelings of inadequacy and comparison, which are potent sources of stress. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress, as the individual grapples with financial pressures, career dissatisfaction, and familial tensions."
I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic. I can't even admit it to myself. It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone. How can I see a therapist if I'm afraid I'm going to lose my shit just opening up about that one day? I feel like it would ruin any progress I've made...I'm afraid I'm going to be hiding forever.,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, particularly through expressions of trauma and fear of vulnerability. the individual repeatedly emphasizes an inability to discuss a past event, highlighting avoidance and emotional suppression, which are common in stressed individuals. the use of phrases like ""traumatic,"" ""awful beyond words,"" and ""afraid i am going to lose my shit"" signals intense emotional distress and anxiety. the fear of regression in progress and the feeling of being trapped (""hiding forever"") further underscore a state of ongoing stress. these elements collectively suggest a profound struggle with unresolved emotional pain and a significant level of psychological stress."
"I cried for hours and at one point, something came over me and just slammed my head into my bathroom door. Sadly, since I'm in a dorm, it's a shitty hallow core door and it broke bad and now there is a hole that I have to figure out how to fix. It's a $100 fine if I can't figure out what to do with it so that's just compounding on the already existing stress. I have $3 to my name right now, I luckily get paid Friday so I will be able to pay for my car, but I'm still left with only $100 for 2 weeks and I have to figure out how to pay for my textbook for my night class. It's a mess and I don't know what to do right now.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, beginning with the emotional response of crying for hours, which is a common manifestation of overwhelming feelings. the act of slamming one's head into a door suggests a moment of acute distress and loss of control, which are significant markers of psychological strain. the subsequent damage to the door and the associated financial burden of fixing it add to the individual's stress, as they are faced with a $100 fine and the challenge of repairing the door in a dorm setting. financial concerns are further highlighted by the mention of having only $3 at the moment, the pressure of waiting for the next paycheck, and the limited funds available for the next two weeks. the need to purchase a textbook for a night class compounds the financial stress, contributing to the overall sense of being overwhelmed and uncertain about how to manage the situation. these elements collectively illustrate a high level of stress, characterized by emotional, financial, and situational pressures."
"She treated me like a freaked-out horse. It was clearly effective. Today, my marriage is different. My wife doesn't rely on me near as much as she did; she looks after her own affairs (poor wording, lol). She also doesn't ask for my opinion on very many things, even though she previously wanted my input on almost everything.",0,"the narrative describes a change in the dynamics of a marriage, highlighting how the wife has become more independent and self-reliant. the phrase ""treated me like a freaked-out horse"" suggests that there was a period of adjustment or a need for calm, but the overall tone indicates that this approach was beneficial and effective. the writer notes that the wife no longer relies on him as much and handles her own affairs, which is described with a touch of humor, indicating a light-hearted perspective. the absence of language that typically signals distress, such as feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, or helplessness, supports the idea that the writer is not experiencing significant stress. instead, the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and possibly even relief that the wife is more self-sufficient, which can contribute to a more balanced and less stressful relationship dynamic."
"As you can imagine, people are not so charitable in this city, but you'd be surprised, people can be generous with what they let slide, its easier than depending on pure charity. At best with this method, you will find a series of short term places, and you will probably get into at least 1 sketchy situation, so always protect yourself and have a way out. If you haven't already, hit up the DPSS. It will take an entire day, but if you tell them you're homeless, they will give you an EBT card that day. It will literally take being homeless and penniless to be eligible for GR--cash relief, or at least that is what it took for me, but within a week or 2 after attending a GROW meeting, you should be eligible for something like 230$ in cash aid.",0,"the narrative describes practical advice for navigating homelessness and accessing social services in a city where charity is scarce. the tone is pragmatic and focused on survival strategies, such as finding temporary shelter and avoiding dangerous situations. the author shares specific steps to obtain assistance, like visiting the dpss for an ebt card and attending a grow meeting for cash aid. the language is matter-of-fact and solution-oriented, reflecting a level-headed approach to challenging circumstances. there is no evident expression of emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety, which suggests the individual is coping effectively and managing their situation with a clear, rational mindset."

Should I wait a year, work and save money before going into school? I'm getting desperate and I don't really know who or what to ask anymore",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the repetitive questioning about moving out, preparing for it, and concerns about education and finances suggests a high level of anxiety and uncertainty. the individual is seeking guidance and reassurance, which is a common behavior in stressed individuals who feel overwhelmed by the decisions they need to make. the phrase ""i am getting desperate"" is a direct expression of their emotional state, indicating a sense of urgency and distress. the lack of clarity on who or what to ask further highlights their feeling of being lost and unsupported, which can exacerbate stress levels. overall, the narrative reflects a person grappling with significant life changes and the associated pressures, which are typical stress indicators."
"I didn't even realize I was doing it until I felt the coldness on the skin of my temple. I thought I would feel fear but all I felt was relief and how easy it would have been to end my overthinking, torturing anxiety brain. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression officially at 12. I have severe insomnia and crippling anxiety constantly which leaves me to overwhelming dark depression. I think about everything I've said and done and it feels like fight of flight all the time.",1,"the narrative reveals a deeply troubled state of mind characterized by overwhelming anxiety and depression. the mention of general anxiety disorder (gad) and depression diagnosed at a young age indicates a long-term struggle with mental health. the individual describes severe insomnia and constant anxiety, which are classic symptoms of chronic stress. the reference to ""overthinking"" and a ""torturing anxiety brain"" further highlights the pervasive nature of their distress. the metaphor of feeling coldness on the skin of their temple suggests a moment of acute crisis, possibly related to self-harm or suicidal ideation, which is a significant indicator of extreme stress. the constant state of ""fight or flight"" mentioned at the end reinforces the chronic stress response, showing that the individual is in a perpetual state of high alert and emotional turmoil. overall, the narrative is filled with markers of severe psychological stress, including insomnia, anxiety, depression, and thoughts of self-harm."
"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for? Or does it have to be a lot worse than that? Sorry if it's a weird question, it's just something I've been thinking about.",1,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing stress, as evidenced by several key aspects. the mention of occasional panic attacks indicates a level of anxiety that can be associated with stress. the fact that the individual’s husband has imposed restrictions on their ability to go places alone suggests a significant concern for their well-being and safety, which could contribute to feelings of stress and helplessness. the inquiry about whether a service dog would be helpful further indicates a search for coping mechanisms and support, which is common among individuals dealing with stress-related conditions. the apology for asking a ""weird question"" also suggests a level of self-consciousness and uncertainty, which are often associated with stress. these elements collectively point towards an underlying stress experienced by the individual."
"My question: how do I heal from this? As much as I wish there were a way to go back and fix my relationship with her, she deserves to heal from the damage I've done, and I have no right to ask for anything -- and so I won't. Lessons I've taken away: + I will **NEVER** do anything like this again. Too much pain for someone you love, and it's very hard to reconcile internally.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of regret and self-blame, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses a desire to heal and acknowledges the harm they've caused in a relationship, demonstrating an internal struggle and emotional turmoil. the use of strong language like ""never"" and the emphasis on the pain inflicted on a loved one highlight the depth of their distress. the acknowledgment of lessons learned and the difficulty in reconciling their actions internally further underscore the ongoing mental and emotional strain. these elements collectively suggest the presence of significant stress as the person grapples with the consequences of their actions and seeks a path to healing."
"Given the diagnosis she refuses to take her prescribed medicine which is a cause for concern to me as when she is on a low, she tends to be very apathetic and rude in responses to conversation or ideas of things we can do. We live together in a house with two other people. We have our own space but the common area is shared. She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes. After our lease is up I want to look for a place that the two of us both like but I am afraid it may be all for nothing.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, including the concern over a partner's refusal to take prescribed medication, which leads to noticeable changes in behavior such as apathy and rudeness. the shared living situation, which the partner dislikes, adds to the stress as it cannot be changed due to financial constraints and lease agreements. the narrator's worry about future housing plans and the fear that their efforts might be futile further underscore the sense of helplessness and anxiety. these elements collectively highlight the stress experienced by the individual, as they navigate relational tensions, behavioral issues, and uncertainty about the future."
"It can influence you to lie, encourage you to do things you wouldn’t do without it. If there’s any way that you can, try to expose it for what it is. Either to yourself, or someone who supports you • Having at least one person who can support you is vital to recovering. They don’t have to know everything, or be a perfect support, but fighting alone is how eating disorders can really take over",0,"the narrative discusses the influence of external factors and the importance of support systems in combating challenges, particularly eating disorders. the tone is reflective and offers advice on seeking help and not fighting alone. the emphasis on exposing the issue and having support, while acknowledging that the support doesn't need to be perfect, suggests a proactive and constructive mindset. this perspective is indicative of someone who is not currently overwhelmed by stress but rather is focused on solutions and recovery. the narrative lacks expressions of acute distress, overwhelming anxiety, or feelings of helplessness, which are common indicators of stress. instead, it conveys a sense of clarity and determination, typical of someone who is managing their situation effectively."
"We had signed up for the boat ride (something she was extremely excited about), but the lines got a little backed up and the time got pushed back. An hour had passed of us at the event and we were scheduled to go on the boat ride in about 15 minutes. However, since that hour had passed, her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home, even though she really wanted to go on the boat. These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation. Since graduation, he accepted that crappy job and moved across the country, taking her with him.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where there is evident frustration and disappointment, particularly from the perspective of the narrator who is observing the conflict between the woman and her boyfriend. the woman is excited about the boat ride, but her boyfriend's refusal to stay longer leads to a missed opportunity, which is a source of irritation. however, the overall tone suggests a pattern of recurring disagreements over values and lifestyle choices, indicating ongoing relationship issues rather than acute stress. the mention of settling into the situation and the boyfriend's acceptance of a less desirable job, causing a move across the country, points to a sense of resignation rather than active distress. the narrative lacks expressions of overwhelming emotional strain or physiological symptoms that would typically indicate stress, such as anxiety, restlessness, or feeling overwhelmed. instead, it focuses more on chronic dissatisfaction and the dynamics of a troubled relationship."

Original frustrating moment: <url> Writing this so y'all can see what kind of people I'm dealing with! I called up the non-profit this morning to ask if I can use another identification document instead of my birth certificate because getting a BC from the clerks dept in my town cost $28 which I don't have.

"When I left my buddy's house, I went to an organic farm where I volunteered for a little while out in nature where I could clear my head. I really enjoyed it immensely but quickly realized I would not be able to get ahead or make a living for myself though I learned a lot of valuable skills that I can take with me along the way in this journey. I came back after about a month to the DFW metroplex where I reside now with my dad, step mom and 6 siblings.

She is a pretty girl, the artsy kind that likes to travel, read poetry and paint, coincidentally the exact opposite of my girlfriend who has very different hobbies.

As much as I like to think I wouldn't I still really love this girl.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the individual is grappling with feelings of being used and treated poorly, highlighting a sense of betrayal and emotional pain. their uncertainty about how to interpret the other person's annoyance at their interactions with other girls suggests a lack of clear communication and unresolved tensions. the mention of the repeated attempts to make the relationship work underscores a pattern of instability and persistent emotional strain. the conflict between wanting to distance themselves and still having strong feelings for the girl further illustrates the internal conflict and stress. these elements collectively point to an individual who is deeply affected by their relationship dynamics, struggling with self-worth, and experiencing significant emotional stress."

Wouldn’t you know it, but my FMIL booked their family vacation for July.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and annoyance, but it doesn't necessarily indicate stress. the writer describes the meticulous planning that went into choosing the wedding date, emphasizing their logical approach and consideration of weather patterns. while the mention of the future mother-in-law booking a family vacation for the same date is clearly an irritant, the tone remains more exasperated than distressed. the focus is on the inconvenience and poor timing rather than on deeper emotional turmoil or anxiety. the writer's use of terms like ""bridezilla"" suggests a self-awareness and an attempt to downplay their frustration, indicating they might be venting rather than experiencing significant stress. overall, the narrative lacks the hallmarks of stress such as overwhelming feelings, pervasive worry, or indications of physical or emotional strain."
"I used to be a very touchy feely person pre trauma, hell I'd have stood out in a big city with a sign for free hugs, I *wanted* to. I'd touch a leg for sympathy, throw an arm around shoulders for comradeship. My family was never like that growing up. Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate. The latter is still true but I make it a joke.",1,"the narrative reflects an individual who has undergone a significant change in behavior and emotional expression due to trauma. the mention of being a ""touchy feely person"" in the past highlights a stark contrast to their current state, indicating a loss of comfort with physical affection. this shift is often a hallmark of stress or trauma, as it can lead to changes in how one interacts with others. the description of their family's lack of physical affection growing up adds context to the individual's previous need for touch and subsequent withdrawal. the awkwardness and joking about physical contact suggest a coping mechanism to deal with discomfort and possibly underlying anxiety. these elements are indicative of someone experiencing stress, as they reflect changes in behavior, coping strategies, and emotional responses that are common in individuals dealing with trauma or high stress levels."

"I feel so worthless on those days. I guess I just needed to vent to a community that will hopefully understand, and see if anyone else had any similar experiences. I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year. PTSD often = dp/dr, benzos often = dp/dr, and benzo withdrawal (which many helpful internet sites say can last months or even years, yay) often = dp/dr. What in the fuck have I done to myself?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of self-worthlessness and regret, which are common indicators of stress. the author discusses their experience with ptsd and the subsequent use of benzodiazepines, which they describe as leading to dissociation and memory loss over the past year. the reference to dp/dr (depersonalization/derealization) linked with ptsd, benzo use, and withdrawal suggests a significant struggle with mental health. the language used, including expressions of frustration and confusion like ""what in the fuck have i done to myself?"" further highlights the author's distress and self-blame. these elements collectively point to a person under considerable stress, dealing with complex emotional and psychological challenges."

She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her ""friends"" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her ""version"" of situations. This is problematic, because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff, customers, and myself, but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum.

I suffer from anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, so this is a nightmare for me.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the descriptions of anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. the context of managing a difficult employee who exhibits manipulative and bullying behavior exacerbates these feelings. the mention of the employee's tantrums and the support she garners from colleagues, despite her problematic behavior, adds to the sense of isolation and helplessness felt by the narrator. the struggle with disciplining the employee without causing further conflict or backlash is a source of ongoing stress. the narrator's depiction of the work environment as a ""nightmare"" underscores the severe impact on their mental health, illustrating classic signs of stress such as feeling overwhelmed, unsupported, and trapped in a toxic situation."

It's hard to admit sometimes, until you're desperate, but I wanted someone to care.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and isolation, which are common indicators of stress. the individual discusses the difficulty of achieving healing and support without a stable home, friends, family, or relationships, highlighting the lack of a support system. the mention of trying to reach a certain point alone and feeling slapped down by a ""selfish pos"" indicates a sense of betrayal and helplessness. the act of posting on twitter out of desperation for connection, and the subsequent disappointment of receiving no response, further underscores feelings of loneliness and despair. these elements collectively suggest a significant emotional burden and a struggle with stress."

She made comments about my weight and how I was too skinny and needed to gain weight.",0,"the narrative describes a sequence of social interactions that started positively but eventually included some negative comments and behaviors. despite these negative experiences, there are no strong indicators of significant distress or overwhelming stress. the individual recounts the events in a relatively straightforward manner, without expressing feelings of anxiety, helplessness, or significant emotional turmoil. the focus is on describing the actions and comments of the other person rather than on the narrator's emotional response to these events. this suggests a level of detachment or resilience that is not typically associated with high stress levels. the mention of arranging a double date and the decision to see each other again indicates social engagement and a proactive approach to relationships, which are not common behaviors in highly stressed individuals. the critical comments about dating experience and weight, while potentially hurtful, are reported factually and without an indication of a deep emotional impact, further supporting the assessment that the individual is not experiencing significant stress."

So I'm somewhat prepared for everything? -Could I get them to stop if I need it?",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of anxiety and worry about a specific situation. the writer is preoccupied with concerns about being judged or not meeting expectations, which is a common stress response. the repeated use of questions suggests a need for reassurance and control over the situation, highlighting feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability. the desire for clear communication and preparation (""could i ask them to tell me everything as they're doing it?"") reflects an attempt to mitigate anxiety by seeking predictability. additionally, the plea for the ability to stop the situation if needed (""could i get them to stop if i need it?"") underscores a need for safety and autonomy, further indicating stress. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of emotional distress and apprehension."
He would call me by the name peepee until I was 21. I asked him to stop but he just yells at me. I wish he would die or never talk to me. He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this. He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and abusive relationship, which is indicative of significant psychological stress. the use of the nickname ""peepee"" until the age of 21, despite requests to stop, demonstrates a lack of respect and persistent emotional abuse. the narrator's wish for the person to die or never talk to them again highlights deep-seated anger and desperation. being forced to take medication as a punitive measure for expressing anger is a clear violation of autonomy and contributes to a sense of helplessness. the threats of being thrown out or having the police called add a layer of fear and instability to the narrator's life. these elements collectively point to a state of chronic stress, stemming from ongoing emotional abuse and coercion."

How do you deal with it?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily through the expression of feeling trapped and the overwhelming sense of uncertainty regarding future career prospects. the individual mentions applying for jobs without success, which can contribute to feelings of frustration and helplessness. the concern about finding a job that will not lead to the same dissatisfaction indicates a fear of repeating negative experiences, a common stressor. the contemplation of drastic actions, such as quitting without a plan, reflects a high level of distress and desperation. the use of words like ""miserable"" and the plea for advice from others further highlight the individual's struggle to cope with their current situation. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress related to job dissatisfaction and uncertainty about the future."

I can use Paypal or Google Wallet, whichever works best.",1,"the narrative reflects significant financial stress. the individual describes a situation where they are struggling to manage their finances, mentioning an unexpected automatic payment that will result in an overdraft fee. this indicates a lack of financial cushion and immediate concern about their monetary stability. the urgency in needing money to avoid further financial trouble, as well as the need to cover a student loan payment, highlights the pressure they are under. the mention of specific amounts needed and the use of multiple payment platforms suggests a desperate attempt to resolve the issue quickly. these elements are typical indicators of stress, particularly financial stress, as they point to a situation where the individual feels overwhelmed and anxious about their immediate financial future."

I was completely on my own by 14. When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ? I said no and she never said anything again. I could go on and on. I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the descriptions of early abandonment and self-harm. being completely on their own at the age of 14 suggests a lack of support and guidance during a critical developmental period, which can lead to chronic stress and feelings of isolation. the mention of cutting and the lack of response from the person who discovered it indicates a cry for help that went unanswered, further exacerbating feelings of neglect and despair. the ongoing blame and internalization of pain, as described in the narrative, point to a deep-seated struggle with self-worth and unresolved trauma. these elements collectively highlight a pattern of enduring stress and emotional turmoil."
"i probably havesevere gad. at least i think i do. i need to get help because im avoiding anything i can. school starts again in a few weeks, and im an upcoming sophmore. i want to stop skipping lunch because all of the people in there make me anxious and i cant bring myself to look up i stare at the ground 99% of the time whenever i walk through the halls because i cant stand to make eye contact.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of anxiety and avoidance behaviors, which are typical indicators of stress. the individual mentions having severe generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and expresses a need for help, highlighting their recognition of the problem and the impact it has on their daily life. the avoidance of activities, such as skipping lunch due to anxiety around people, indicates a high level of distress and social anxiety. the upcoming school year adds to the pressure, as they are already feeling overwhelmed by the thought of interacting with peers. the inability to make eye contact and the tendency to stare at the ground are classic symptoms of social anxiety and stress, suggesting that the individual is struggling to cope with their environment. these factors combined point to a narrative deeply rooted in stress and anxiety."
"I told her what if her other son doesn't want him to live with him? the reality is no matter how bad or how old he is, he is still her son and she cant shake off that biological attachment she has towards him and not worry about him. This is where the problem becomes for me. I have an online friend of 5 years and she offered to me that I can stay with her for 3 month for free and during that time I can find a job to help pay rent. that's what thinking of doing.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is dealing with practical life decisions and social relationships. while there are elements of concern and consideration for others, such as the mention of a mother’s attachment to her son and the practicalities of living arrangements, the tone does not convey overwhelming stress. the individual appears to be thinking logically about solutions, like considering staying with an online friend to find a job and pay rent. the absence of language indicating intense emotional distress, panic, or a sense of being overwhelmed suggests a more composed state of mind. the narrative’s focus on problem-solving and the presence of a support system through the online friend are indicative of coping mechanisms rather than indicators of significant stress."

Unfortunately, my meds only impact anxiety (and only sometimes), not depression or PTSD.",1,"the narrative contains several clear indicators of significant psychological distress. the individual expresses a long-term struggle with suicidal thoughts, stating they have felt this way almost every day for 17 years. this chronicity suggests a deep-rooted issue that has not been adequately addressed despite attempts at therapy and seeking help from friends. the mention of being ""done talking to therapists"" indicates a sense of hopelessness and frustration with conventional support systems. the person's contemplation of suicide as one of only two options available to them further highlights the severity of their distress. they also discuss the limitations of their current medication, noting it only occasionally helps with anxiety and does not address their depression or ptsd, underscoring a lack of effective treatment. the consideration of developing an emergency self-care plan as an alternative to suicide shows a glimmer of hope and a desire for self-preservation, but it also reflects the critical state they are in, feeling that immediate and drastic measures are necessary to ensure their safety. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and psychological turmoil."
"I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth. The worst thing is, I can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor. I felt like I could get through it on my own. Even now, its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.",1,"the narrative reflects significant internal conflict and emotional distress. the individual expresses fear and self-doubt about their own memories and perceptions, indicating a struggle with trust and self-validation. the mention of ""demonizing him"" suggests a potential trauma or difficult past relationship that complicates their emotional processing. the inability to talk to anyone, including their fiance, highlights isolation and difficulty in seeking support, which are common indicators of stress. the self-assessment of not being ""bad enough"" to need a doctor reveals a minimization of their own struggles, further emphasizing the stress they are experiencing. these elements collectively point to a high level of psychological strain and the presence of unresolved issues contributing to their stress."

This is what she decides to do after I tell her how anxious I am, how a heavy duty benzo isn't working and how I'm near the brink of ending my life due to fear and anxiety and have no options left. Do I blame her for being cautious? No.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through the expressions of frustration and desperation. the individual mentions being on numerous medications and feeling knowledgeable about what works for them, suggesting a prolonged struggle with their condition. the reference to anxiety and a heavy-duty benzo not being effective underscores the severity of their symptoms. the mention of being near the brink of ending their life due to fear and anxiety highlights a critical level of distress and hopelessness. despite acknowledging the caution of their healthcare provider, the narrative's tone conveys a sense of helplessness and urgency, which are strong indicators of acute stress. the combination of these elements points to a high level of psychological distress, typical of someone experiencing significant stress."
I realized he is not very nice or smart and totally unwilling to cooperate/compromise. I wanted to leave but he had spent all my money (promising to give it back haha) and I had nowhere to go. I had the baby (he went out to eat with his mother while I was in unmedicated labor). Basically I made one stupid mistake after another and let him walk all over me and it doesn't stop there. I took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, evident through the description of challenging interpersonal dynamics and significant life events. the author mentions realizing negative traits in their partner, such as a lack of niceness, intelligence, and willingness to cooperate or compromise. this realization can lead to feelings of frustration and helplessness. the situation is exacerbated by financial dependence, as the partner spent all the author's money, leaving them with no options to leave. the mention of having a baby while the partner was absent during labor highlights a lack of support during a critical time, further contributing to feelings of abandonment and stress. the author describes a pattern of making mistakes and being walked over, indicating a loss of control and self-blame, which are common in stressful situations. taking care of the baby alone for six months adds to the emotional and physical burden, reinforcing the presence of significant stressors in the author's life. overall, the narrative is characterized by themes of isolation, lack of support, financial strain, and overwhelming responsibility, all of which are strong indicators of stress."

I don't know what to do. Mostly, I am scared that I will deal some kind of huge blow to his mental health and am just very scared of the repurcussions. I have friends apart from him I feel like I can fall back on, but I feel like a monster for confirming his fear of abandonment. I also feel conflicted because he is incredibly kind and generous and affectionate",1,"the narrative contains multiple indicators of stress, such as feelings of fear, conflict, and guilt. the author describes a situation where they attempted to end a relationship but were met with resistance, leading to anxiety about the potential impact on the other person's mental health. phrases like ""i do not know what to do"" and ""i am scared"" highlight the uncertainty and fear the author is experiencing. the mention of feeling like a ""monster"" for potentially confirming the partner's fear of abandonment indicates deep emotional turmoil and self-blame. additionally, the conflict between recognizing the partner's positive traits and the need to end the relationship further exacerbates the stress, as the author struggles to reconcile these opposing feelings. these elements collectively suggest a high level of emotional distress and cognitive dissonance, which are common indicators of stress."
"No I’m not. What I am saying though is that man and woman were designed to have a mate. A mate who completes you and makes you happy. A mate you can love and be loved by.

He's different.",0,"the narrative starts with a positive outlook on life, mentioning that things are great in various aspects such as work and personal relationships. this suggests a stable and content state of mind. however, the mention of receiving a friend suggestion on facebook related to an abusive ex-boyfriend introduces a moment of discomfort. the individual acknowledges the past abuse but does not exhibit ongoing distress or anxiety about the situation. instead, the tone remains relatively composed, and the reaction to the ex-boyfriend's changed appearance is described without emotional turmoil. the lack of detailed emotional response or signs of current distress suggests that the individual is reflecting on the past incident with a level of detachment, indicating resilience and a non-stressed state."

After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of stress. the individual describes a traumatic history of being molested by their biological father over several years, which is a significant source of psychological distress. the use of phrases like ""i am not very good at expressing my emotions"" and ""i need advice/help"" suggests difficulty in managing and articulating their emotional state, which is common among those experiencing stress. the repeated attempts to communicate the abuse to their mother and the subsequent negative reaction of annoyance and anger from the mother likely exacerbated feelings of helplessness and isolation, further contributing to their stress. the context of seeking forgiveness for being new to expressing their emotions also hints at a lack of confidence and self-esteem, which are often affected by prolonged exposure to traumatic stress. overall, the narrative's content and emotional tone align with typical indicators of significant stress."
He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane. I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me. I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious. Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts. It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,1,"the narrative exhibits classic signs of stress, such as persistent self-doubt and paranoia, indicating a heightened state of anxiety. the individual's constant need to check for bruises or anything suspicious reflects hypervigilance, a common symptom of stress and trauma. the mention of feeling shameful and experiencing thoughts of self-harm or dying suggests severe emotional distress. additionally, the perception that everyone has an agenda against them and the feeling of being misunderstood and minimized by family members further exacerbate their sense of isolation and helplessness. these elements collectively point to a significant level of psychological strain and stress."
"He and I have been pretty ""huggy"" the last couple years, and since he scared me I cut all physical contact off completely. He didn't try to initiate it today even though we won't be seeing each other for several weeks, so that's something. I don't plan on allowing any of it for the forseeable future - maybe unless I feel like he's really learned something or changed somehow. I don't plan on staying the night at his place or letting him stay at mine. Probably will limit our contact to public or ""other people present"" for the most part.",0,"the narrative reflects a methodical and deliberate approach to setting boundaries and maintaining personal safety, which are indicative of a person who is actively managing their circumstances rather than being overwhelmed by them. the writer details specific actions they have taken, such as cutting off physical contact and limiting interactions to public settings, demonstrating a clear and controlled response to a situation that previously caused distress. the language used is calm and resolute, lacking signs of emotional turmoil or anxiety. this structured and proactive stance suggests a level of self-awareness and emotional regulation that is typically not present in individuals experiencing high levels of stress."
"So we were talking about it and she wouldn't budge again. The conversation started to heat up, nothing I said was enough, that we would buy something, that I would cook with her, that we could go 1 day earlier and cook at my grandma's, nothing. She pushed me to the edge again until I lost it and ended the argue saying that she mustn't go this year with me.

"I have been living in <location> at a homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army since the beginning of February (I know it hasn't been that long but still), and I started a new job a month or so later around the beginning of March. I don't know if my boss did a google search of the address I have on record or maybe drove past it one day, but I overheard him talking to another one of the staff about how 'the homeless population here in Toronto is getting pretty bad, and how there might be a lot once the weather improves because of the people trying to leave the USA because of Trump' And since I heard this conversation, I went from having 3 shifts of 4 hours per week (12 hours per week), down to this week I have 1 shift that's only 3 hours, and he's blaming how our sales are really slow, which they are down by an average of 4% compared to last year according to the reports that are printed automatically each day. It also doesn't help that since I started a month ago, we had 11 employees and as of this morning we now have 16. Tell me why the hell if business is so slow, why did we increase the number of staff by almost 50%?",1,"the narrative reflects significant stressors that are impacting the individual's life. living in a homeless shelter and starting a new job are both major life changes that can contribute to elevated stress levels. the individual's concern about their boss potentially discovering their living situation and the subsequent reduction in work hours add to their anxiety. the overheard conversation about the homeless population and the perceived discrimination could be exacerbating feelings of insecurity and stress. the confusion and frustration over the increase in staff despite slow business and reduced hours further highlight the individual's stress. these elements, including the uncertainty about job security and the sense of being unfairly treated, are typical indicators of stress. the narrative showcases how external circumstances and perceived injustices can compound to create a high-stress environment for the individual."

Through my interactions with him, I have gotten the hint that Jack is interested in me, in a more-than-friends kind of way. I don't want to assume this as a fact—it's certainly possible that he is just trying to make a new friend.

"2. Socialize! we sure did not evolve as lone creatures, we always evolved as packs, it was always crucial to our survival, and thats why we get anxious without it, even if we dont know it, but that doesn't mean you need to 24/7 socialize, Remember - lonliness is a nice place to visit, but a horrible place to live in, so go out there and simply talk to other people, it can be your school mates, colleagues, or even something a lot more simple such as your local shop clerk, in the last few years we can see a sharp decline in socializing because mainly everything became online, and our survival instincts kick in, letting us know something is way off, and needs to be fixed, it does not like being alone, and do not try to replace real human socializing with social networks, which brings me to the next point - &#x200B; 3.",0,"the narrative emphasizes the importance of socializing for human survival and well-being, highlighting how we have evolved to thrive in social environments. it acknowledges that while loneliness can be a temporary retreat, prolonged isolation is detrimental. the writer provides practical advice on engaging with others, suggesting interactions with schoolmates, colleagues, or even local shop clerks. the decline in face-to-face socializing due to the rise of online interactions is noted, along with the assertion that real human connection cannot be replaced by social networks. the tone is instructive and proactive, focusing on solutions and the benefits of social interaction rather than expressing personal distress or anxiety. this perspective is indicative of someone who understands the importance of social bonds and is advocating for their maintenance, rather than someone experiencing stress from a lack of social interaction themselves."

"I’m high risk for PPD seeing as I have preexisting BPD and anxiety, and going back into working immediately after giving birth would most likely be very damaging. Not to mention I haven’t had the easiest pregnancy, having had multiple emergency room stays and having been hospitalized.

The only way he could have done right by us, would have been to give us kids up.",0,"the narrative describes a difficult and tragic situation involving the loss of a father to a heroin overdose and the father's regret over his past actions. while the content is undeniably heavy and filled with emotional weight, the tone of the narrative suggests a level of acceptance and understanding. the author reflects on the father's efforts to be better than his own cruel father and acknowledges the complexity of the situation. the use of phrases like ""it is so hard for me to think he knew any better"" indicates a thoughtful contemplation rather than an immediate emotional response. this level of introspection and the absence of immediate emotional distress, such as anxiety or panic, are typical indicators that the author is processing the events with a degree of calmness and rationality, which are not typical signs of acute stress."

We came in when you were in bed last night and uncle _______ held you for a bit” and I remember being super confused because I didn’t remember that, and also, why would they come in and hold me when I was asleep? Anyway, that memory was weird.",0,"the narrative describes a specific childhood memory that the individual finds confusing and strange. the detailed recollection of events, such as wearing purple underwear and the interaction with family members, is clear but not emotionally charged or indicative of current distress. the individual questions the oddity of the situation but does not express ongoing anxiety, fear, or other symptoms commonly associated with stress. the tone remains neutral, focusing on the curiosity and confusion about the past rather than conveying any significant emotional turmoil or distress. this suggests that while the memory is unusual, it does not appear to be a source of current psychological stress."

I would really like to be able to hang out with her, like cook dinner, or go to a bar, or watch a movie, for example, and then just both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing.

Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.",1,"the narrative describes an individual's experience with health anxiety, which is often triggered by stressful periods in their personal or working life. the person mentions a significant loss in childhood, which could be a foundational trauma contributing to their current anxiety. they have identified patterns in their anxiety episodes, noting that these episodes are often preceded by stress and manifest through psychosomatic symptoms. the narrative also highlights that hearing about illness or death can trigger their anxiety, indicating a heightened sensitivity to health-related information. these elements, such as the recognition of psychosomatic symptoms, the impact of past trauma, and the specific triggers related to health, are typical indicators of stress. this awareness and detailed account of their anxiety episodes suggest a persistent underlying stress related to health concerns."

To this day, I think heavily of this, and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child. Please.",1,"the narrative describes a prolonged period of abuse, including physical threats and psychological torment. the mention of enduring ""months and months of all types of abuse"" indicates a sustained high-stress environment. the specific incident of being threatened with gym equipment while pregnant adds a layer of acute stress and fear for personal and unborn child's safety. the denial of paternity and taking everything from the narrator points to emotional manipulation and loss, which are significant stressors. the fixation on a silent witness and the fear of karmic retribution show lingering anxiety and unresolved trauma. these elements collectively highlight a state of ongoing psychological distress, which are typical indicators of stress."

I never did anything ""bad"" until I was in my early teens.",0,"the narrative describes feelings of guilt and internal conflict, particularly in relation to the author's interactions with someone they care about. while these emotions are significant, they do not necessarily indicate stress in a clinical sense. the author reflects on their past behavior and the influence of their mother's voice, which suggests a struggle with internalized expectations and self-judgment. however, the narrative lacks signs of acute distress or overwhelming anxiety. instead, it seems more focused on processing and understanding these emotions. the mention of being a ""goodie-two-shoes"" and the lack of any description of current disruptive symptoms or severe emotional turmoil suggests that the author is dealing with common emotional challenges rather than clinical stress."
"I can't find an affordable place to rent that would fit in with my budget and I have no savings. I've looked up a lot of the shelters around me that give out meals/ have assistance, but they all close before I get out of work so I can't even drive over and ask questions. I can't call during work because I work in a very customer-centric work environment. So I guess my questions are: What should I be looking out for when living in my car? How do I go NC with my dad but still keep in contact with my family?",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the writer's description of their financial struggles and living situation. the individual expresses difficulty in finding affordable housing, which is a primary source of stress due to the basic need for shelter. the lack of savings compounds this stress, as it leaves no financial buffer for emergencies. the mention of looking into shelters but being unable to access them due to work hours adds to the sense of helplessness and frustration. the inability to call during work because of a customer-centric environment further limits their options, increasing feelings of entrapment. the questions about living in a car and navigating family relationships, particularly the desire to go no contact with their dad while maintaining other family connections, highlight a complex web of personal and familial stressors. these elements collectively indicate a high level of stress, as the individual is grappling with immediate survival concerns, logistical barriers, and strained family dynamics."

"I'm 29 and I've just committed to moving into a shared apartment in my city centre. I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom, but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues. I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre. But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake. Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly due to the significant life change of moving to a shared apartment in a bustling city center. the author expresses apprehension about the new living arrangement, highlighting concerns about living with many other people, which is a notable stressor for someone identifying as an introvert. the mention of feeling scared and worried about making a mistake suggests anxiety about adapting to the new environment. additionally, the proximity to an ex-best friend and the potential for awkward encounters adds another layer of stress. these elements collectively illustrate the author's heightened state of worry and apprehension, which are typical indicators of experiencing stress."
"I grew up my country’s equivalent of the bible belt. My country is well known for being very very progressive in our larger cities, and very very conservative in our villages – this is true I think for most countries, but the sheer difference between our “levels” is pretty well known. I grew up in an abusive household, surrounded by really misogynist men, and have experienced trauma on both these fronts. This obviously caused me some mental health issues. I was afraid of, and uncomfortable around, men for a very long time.",1,"the narrative describes a challenging upbringing in a conservative and abusive environment, which is a significant indicator of stress. the individual mentions growing up in a region with stark cultural contrasts, which can create a sense of isolation and confusion. the experience of trauma and abuse in their household, combined with exposure to misogynistic attitudes, are clear sources of psychological distress. the mention of mental health issues stemming from these experiences, along with a prolonged fear and discomfort around men, further underscores the presence of stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of an individual who has endured significant emotional and psychological strain."
I wanna break down my situation. I know you guys can't help but I need to vent. My partner works in a job he is treated like crap in and hates for little money. He is looking for new work.

"I've put him up in a motel for a few days, bought him a bike, and gave him some money, but I know I can't afford to have him stay at a motel forever (or even support him like that! ), the money will run out, and I just feel sick/stressed/sad because I don't even know what to do at this point or how to help anymore than what I've already done. I work full time and have to suppport myself and I live at home with my mother and she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. He needs help and I just don't what else I can do. Any advice or resources would be much appreciated!",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of emotional distress and anxiety. the individual is grappling with the financial and emotional burden of supporting someone in need, which is causing them to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. the repeated expressions of feeling ""sick/stressed/sad"" are clear indicators of their current emotional state. the mention of their full-time job and the need to support themselves while living with a mother who is unsupportive of the situation adds to the complexity and pressure they are experiencing. the plea for advice or resources underscores their desperation and sense of helplessness, which are common psychological responses to prolonged stress and overwhelming circumstances. these elements collectively illustrate the hallmarks of a person under significant stress, trying to navigate a challenging and emotionally taxing situation."
"I'm having problems with a friend and I thought an outsider's perspective might be useful. She's always been a bit overly emotional and controlling, having previously been very easy to anger, and having previously tracked me and an ex through my phone, and going through my belongings without my knowledge to check texts etc. It really worsened recently. Maybe a year or so arguments because a regular occurrence when we had been drinking. I've had to deal with taking care of her after outbursts like this on numerous occasions, the worst being a visit to the hospital when she stormed off and I found her in a parking lot, having fallen and hit their head.",1,"the narrative describes a series of troubling interactions with a friend who exhibits controlling and intrusive behaviors, such as tracking the author through their phone and going through their belongings without permission. these actions are clear violations of personal boundaries and can be significant stressors. the situation has escalated to the point where arguments have become frequent, particularly when alcohol is involved, further intensifying the stress. the author also mentions the responsibility of taking care of the friend after emotional outbursts, including a serious incident requiring a hospital visit. these elements indicate a persistent and escalating source of stress, highlighting the psychological burden of managing a relationship fraught with emotional volatility and boundary violations."
"Two days ago I packed all of my clothes into my car and have started living out of it. I sleep in the parking lot at work, work for 8 hours, and then spend the day at Starbucks on the internet and charging my electronics. Once Thursday rolls around I will have ~$400, which is not much as far as being able to afford a place to sleep. If I become good at living out of my car over the next few days, I may just use some of that money to invest in making it easier for myself. I don't really know why I'm posting this here, except that living out of your car is a pretty lonely experience.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the context of homelessness and financial instability. the individual describes a drastic change in living conditions, moving into their car and sleeping in a parking lot, which inherently suggests a high level of stress. the detailed account of their daily routine—working, spending time at starbucks, and managing electronic charging—reflects a struggle to maintain normalcy under challenging circumstances. the mention of a limited amount of money and uncertainty about future living arrangements further emphasizes financial anxiety. the acknowledgment of loneliness and the lack of clear reasons for sharing their experience suggest a need for social support and an outlet for their feelings, which are common psychological responses to stress. these elements collectively highlight the individual's stressful situation and the psychological burden they are carrying."
It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me. Later in the day I texted her and we talked. I asked her how the trip went. She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us. I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual initially experiences a strong emotional reaction, likening it to being punched, which might suggest a momentary intense feeling. however, the subsequent actions and interactions described in the narrative indicate a resolution of that initial distress. the individual takes proactive steps by texting and having a conversation, which appears to alleviate their concerns. the tone shifts to one of relief and optimism as they discuss the trip and clarify any doubts about the friend's involvement. the presence of clear communication and the resolution of potential worries are indicative of an absence of prolonged or significant stress. the person's ability to engage in a productive dialogue and achieve a positive outcome suggests they are managing their emotions effectively and not exhibiting signs of ongoing stress."
It does eventually pass once i realise they are sticking by me. Some just cant stick it out which is fair enough. I find it frustrating though as i have just drove someone away who i really liked. He has ended up deleting and blocking me as he didnt at all help with reassurance which just made my mind go into overdrive creating scenarios that were probably non existent. Does anybody else deal with this?,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disappointment stemming from interpersonal relationships. the individual acknowledges the eventual resolution of their feelings once they receive support, which indicates an ability to process and overcome initial emotional turmoil. the mention of others not being able to ""stick it out"" and the resulting frustration is common in everyday experiences of relationship dynamics, rather than a pervasive sense of stress. while the person expresses regret about driving someone away and the subsequent overthinking, these reactions are situational and not indicative of chronic stress. the query about whether others experience similar situations suggests a normalizing of their feelings, seeking validation rather than expressing a deeper, ongoing distress. overall, the narrative displays typical emotional responses to specific relational events without persistent indicators of stress."
"It's heartbreaking to watch him get up at night to cry. I suggested therapy but he's not in favour of it. I think his father passing has also altered his reactions, which are out of whack now. I was sick last week and was not in town - he let a couple of dishes fester in the sink, and I discovered when I got back that there was fungus on it. (i.e.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual is expressing concern for someone else rather than themselves. while the events mentioned, such as crying at night and the reluctance to seek therapy, suggest distress in the person being observed, the narrator's focus is on supporting and managing the situation rather than experiencing stress firsthand. the narrator's tone appears more observational and problem-solving oriented, indicating an ability to maintain perspective and composure. even when mentioning being sick and discovering the dishes with fungus, the response is practical and focused on the immediate need to address the issue, rather than expressing personal overwhelm or stress. this suggests that the narrator is not currently experiencing significant stress themselves, but rather is managing the challenges presented by another's distress."
"Basically I’m going through quite a bit right now. I suffer from anxiety, depression probably (low mood, irritation, poor concentration) and things just haven’t been going that well. My friend who has autism makes off-the-wall jokes about death and killing in general. That bothers me as two of my friends have passed away in their 20s… And I still think about them and try to remember the good times. Suffering from The Doubting Disease has been fun.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, including explicit mentions of anxiety and depression, which are classic psychological symptoms associated with stress. the writer lists symptoms such as low mood, irritation, and poor concentration, which further underscore their mental health struggles. the mention of a friend's inappropriate jokes about death exacerbates the writer's distress, especially given their personal history of losing two friends at a young age. this loss adds a layer of grief and unresolved trauma that compounds their current stress levels. additionally, the reference to ""the doubting disease"" likely points to a struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder or a similar condition, which is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts that can significantly heighten stress. these elements collectively illustrate a person grappling with multiple stressors and emotional burdens."
"When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love, I can get kind of possessive. My partner is very much the opposite. All of his relationships have been open and he's slept with pretty much all of his friends. Maybe a few months ago he told me that he'd really like it if I slept with other people. I was fairly keen but was getting weird gut fear at the thought of him sleeping with other people.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is grappling with the dynamics of an open relationship. they express a shift in their feelings from being unbothered by casual relationships to experiencing possessiveness once they fall in love. while the partner is comfortable with open relationships and encourages the individual to explore other connections, the individual experiences a ""weird gut fear"" at the thought of their partner being with others. this suggests a struggle with reconciling their feelings of love and possessiveness with the concept of an open relationship. however, the narrative lacks elements typically associated with high stress, such as overwhelming anxiety, panic, or significant emotional turmoil. the individual's reflections seem more about navigating personal boundaries and emotional responses rather than exhibiting acute stress symptoms. the described ""gut fear"" appears to be a natural reaction to a challenging situation rather than a sign of significant stress."
"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18, but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it. I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame. In the last 4 months though, someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced. He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"". He makes fake accounts and tries to add me or adds my friends accusing them of taking me from him.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, as seen through the recounting of traumatic experiences and ongoing harassment. the individual mentions being diagnosed with ptsd, which itself is a condition that often involves intense stress responses. despite initially feeling detached from the diagnosis, the resurfacing harassment has likely exacerbated feelings of distress. the person describes receiving hundreds of threatening and manipulative messages, which can lead to heightened anxiety, fear, and a sense of being overwhelmed. the mention of shame also suggests internalized stress and emotional turmoil. the harasser's behavior, including creating fake accounts to infiltrate the individual's social circle, further contributes to a pervasive sense of insecurity and lack of safety. these elements collectively indicate a high level of psychological strain and stress."
"Our family cat Bootsy became very ill and we took her to the vet. We spent what little money we had on diagnostics there and after an ultrasound it was determined she would need surgery immediately or she would likely die. We didn't have the money for surgery but found an organization which would perform the procedure and provide necessary care to help her if we transferred ownership. We gave Bootsy up to have a chance of saving her life. After some weeks of care and a surgery, we recently found out Bootsy fully recovered, but the organization will not return her to us unless we pay for a portion of the cost of her care, approximately $650.",1,"the narrative describes a series of distressing events, beginning with the illness of a beloved family pet, bootsy. the family faced financial constraints, which added to their emotional burden, as they had to spend their limited resources on veterinary diagnostics. the urgent need for surgery and the inability to afford it heightened their anxiety and stress. the decision to transfer ownership of bootsy to an organization in hopes of saving her life was a significant emotional sacrifice. the subsequent period of waiting for updates on her recovery likely contributed to ongoing stress and uncertainty. even after learning of bootsy's full recovery, the family's stress is compounded by the organization’s demand for a substantial payment to regain ownership, which they may still struggle to afford. these elements of financial strain, emotional sacrifice, and ongoing uncertainty are typical indicators of stress."
I was also forced (with threat of prison time) to get asleep apnea test. Fastest response from the VA I’ve ever seen. Within 36 hours I was diagnosed and set up with a CPAP machine. Matches up with my ex-wife’s thoughts that I don’t sleep more than 30 min before coughing myself awake and throwing fists. Burn pits fucking suck.,1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through multiple indicators. the mention of being ""forced (with threat of prison time)"" highlights a sense of coercion and lack of control, which are common stressors. the rapid response from the va and the subsequent diagnosis of sleep apnea suggest a serious health concern, further contributing to the individual's stress. the description of coughing oneself awake and throwing fists during sleep implies severe sleep disturbances, which are both a symptom and a cause of heightened stress. additionally, the mention of ""burn pits"" likely refers to exposure to hazardous conditions, adding another layer of chronic stress related to health and environmental factors. overall, the narrative encapsulates various elements that are typical indicators of stress, such as loss of control, health issues, sleep problems, and environmental hazards."
"-I don't have any relief in my symptoms and am concerned that I've wasted an entire year of my life I'm concerned that I not leave this relationship too soon, but at the same time, I'm paying for this therapy, I have repeatedly brought up questions about goals in my sessions, and don't feel like this is the right fit...unless I need to open up more. I chose her initially because she was covered by my insurance less because I felt like she was the right match. Do I stick this out? I have started to fantasize about having a new therapist, because then I could start over and feel heard.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through expressions of ongoing concern and dissatisfaction. the individual describes a lack of relief from symptoms, which suggests persistent distress. the worry about wasting an entire year reflects feelings of frustration and regret, common in stressed individuals. the internal conflict about leaving the relationship too soon versus staying in a potentially unhelpful therapy situation indicates indecision and anxiety. frequent questioning of goals in sessions highlights a search for clarity and direction, which is often disrupted by stress. additionally, the choice of therapist based on insurance coverage rather than a perceived match implies a compromise that may contribute to the individual's discomfort. the fantasy of finding a new therapist to feel heard further underscores a desire for validation and effective support, elements that are crucial yet unmet, reinforcing the presence of stress."
"We kept in touch the entire time (and he'd always seem to want me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I'm back""). But when he got back, he didn't see me right away. And despite my asking him a couple of times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for nearly two months. Eventually, I literally said ""So are we ever going to see each other again or is this just over?"" He responded by immediately asking me on a date for that week, at a nice French restaurant near his place.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with a delay in seeing someone they care about, but the overall tone lacks the intensity and persistent negative emotions typically associated with stress. while there is some frustration expressed about the delay and the need to explicitly ask if they will meet again, the resolution comes quickly with a positive outcome—a date at a nice french restaurant. this resolution suggests that the situation was more of a temporary inconvenience rather than a significant source of ongoing stress. the narrative does not indicate pervasive worry, anxiety, or other stress-related symptoms; instead, it shows a momentary lapse in communication that is swiftly and satisfactorily addressed."
"They can’t get into a shelter because they are employed but they still don’t make enough to afford to rent anywhere. They’ve tried rooms for rent but they can’t get into anything because it’s either, no couples, no kids, male only, female only etc. Hotel/Motel rooms are expensive. They have no family or friends that would be willing to accommodate them. What would you suggest to them?",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation where individuals are unable to secure housing despite being employed. it details the obstacles they face, such as restrictive rental conditions and the high cost of temporary accommodations. while the scenario is undoubtedly difficult and could be a source of stress, the tone of the narrative is factual and focused on problem-solving rather than expressing emotional distress. the lack of emotional language, such as expressions of anxiety, frustration, or hopelessness, suggests that the writer is maintaining a level of detachment and is seeking practical advice rather than conveying personal stress. this objective approach is a key indicator that the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress, as they are addressing the issue with a clear, solution-oriented mindset."
"While he constantly texts and asks what I'm doing. If I don't satisfactorily respond, he gets passive aggressive and tells me he's worried about what I'm doing, he's ""bugging out"" his ears are ringing so he knows I'm doing something. He said that today. Via text when I was on the phone with driver control. It makes me think he is psychic or something, because any time I do anything to try and get past this relationship, for myself, it's like he knows.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with a person who exhibits controlling and paranoid behavior. the text messages and passive-aggressive responses from the other person create an environment that could be stressful. however, the individual recounts these events in a way that suggests they are more puzzled and intrigued by the behavior rather than overwhelmed or distressed by it. the mention of the other person ""bugging out"" and thinking they are psychic indicates a sense of disbelief or curiosity rather than personal stress. the narrative lacks expressions of personal anxiety, helplessness, or emotional strain that are typically indicators of stress. instead, it focuses on the oddity of the other person's actions, suggesting a more detached and observational perspective."
"I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point. When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash. Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside. We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water. He refuses because he hates water.",0,"the narrative describes a person seeking advice about their relationship, expressing uncertainty about what constitutes a healthy and compatible relationship. while there are elements of conflict, such as differing interests and preferences, the tone of the narrative is more reflective and seeking understanding rather than expressing acute distress. the individual provides specific examples, like the kayaking incident, which illustrate the personality clashes without conveying overwhelming frustration or emotional turmoil. the focus is on finding a resolution and understanding, which suggests a problem-solving approach rather than being overwhelmed by stress. these elements indicate a thoughtful consideration of the relationship dynamics rather than a heightened state of stress."

And at that point I feeling like a gave up (it being 6 yrs to this day since I've graduated High school and grasped an idea). I currently want nothing from him. I still love my father and would do for him as he is still my dad but I don't trust him at all!! I did not mention the fact that he'll go through the garbage to see what me and my mother thrown out.,1,"the narrative reveals significant signs of stress through the writer's expression of frustration and emotional conflict. the mention of the father's rant about his possessions and the writer's reaction to it highlights an ongoing tension. the writer feels a sense of giving up, as indicated by their reflection on the six years since graduating high school without a clear direction. the strained relationship with the father is evident, especially with the lack of trust despite the enduring love. the father's behavior of going through the garbage adds to the stress, suggesting a sense of invasion of privacy and control. these elements collectively point to a stressful family dynamic and personal struggle, which are typical indicators of stress."
Now I want to drink till I'm drunk again and my head sounds as though there is yelling when I'm the only one home. Hmm...fun times. At least I have a drs appointment coming up soon so I can bring it up. Still. These moments suck.,1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, including the desire to drink until drunk, which can be a coping mechanism for managing overwhelming emotions. the mention of hearing yelling in one's head despite being alone suggests intrusive thoughts or auditory hallucinations, which are often associated with high levels of stress and anxiety. the sarcastic tone in ""hmm...fun times"" indicates a sense of frustration or resignation. the acknowledgment of an upcoming doctor's appointment shows a recognition of the need for help, but the phrase ""these moments suck"" underscores the distress and negative impact these experiences have on the individual's well-being. these elements collectively point to a state of significant stress."
"There is a time difference and he's busy! don't worry about it winteryokohama"" but there is also crazy brain that is thinking, ""This is him trying to never talk to me again and end things.""

What are your thoughts reddit?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily stemming from the individual's concern about their relationship. the writer's acknowledgment of the time difference and the other person's busyness indicates an attempt to rationalize the situation, yet they still experience intrusive, distressing thoughts suggesting abandonment (""this is him trying to never talk to me again and end things""). this cognitive dissonance—where rational thoughts conflict with irrational fears—is a hallmark of stress. the phrase ""i am driving myself crazy and i am sick of it"" explicitly conveys a sense of overwhelming mental strain. additionally, the effort to balance giving space and not spamming with texts suggests a preoccupation with managing the relationship's dynamics, which further signifies anxiety and stress. the plea for advice from reddit underscores a need for external validation and support, highlighting feelings of uncertainty and emotional turmoil. these elements collectively point to a stressed state of mind."

I tried to get away.,1,"the narrative describes a traumatic and violent experience involving physical assault, which is a clear indicator of high stress levels. the mention of heavy head bruising and a concussion lasting two weeks highlights the severity of the physical harm endured. the repeated acts of being kneed, kicked, and punched suggest a prolonged and intense attack, contributing to both physical and psychological distress. the individual's attempts to escape and get away underscore a sense of desperation and fear, which are common emotional responses in highly stressful situations. such experiences can lead to significant mental health issues, including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and depression. the vivid recounting of the assault and the injuries sustained are typical indicators of someone experiencing severe stress and trauma."
"They threw me up against the wall, patted me down and told me to sit down outside. The first agent ran in making quick tactical turns around the corners and in the rooms with his gun out. I asked one of the cops what was going on a few times before the words ""Child Pornography"" dropped out of his mouth like a fucking anvil in my gut. I didn't say anything, I could not comprehend that it was really happening. I've been through some shit in my life but I've never experienced the level of total bewilderment and unreality that I did when I realized the FBIs Crimes Against Children unit was raiding me for kiddie porn.",1,"the narrative describes a highly intense and traumatic experience involving law enforcement, which is a significant indicator of stress. the physical actions of being thrown against a wall and patted down are immediate sources of physical and emotional distress. the abrupt and severe accusation of involvement in child pornography adds a profound layer of psychological shock and disbelief. the individual's description of feeling a metaphorical ""anvil"" in their gut and their inability to comprehend the situation are classic signs of acute stress and emotional overload. the mention of past hardships yet highlighting this event as uniquely bewildering further underscores the severity of the current stress. the overall tone conveys a sense of being overwhelmed, disoriented, and deeply affected by the unexpected and serious nature of the accusations and the raid."

Blackie has been my cat for the last ten years, and without this treatment there is a good chance he will not make it past summer.",1,"the narrative presents several indicators typical of an individual experiencing stress. the mention of financial strain, highlighted by the cost of the procedure and the reliance on a credit card with the acknowledgment of prolonged debt, underscores significant economic pressure. the emotional attachment to blackie, a pet of ten years, and the concern over his health and survival adds an emotional burden. the impending medical procedure for blackie creates an additional layer of anxiety and uncertainty. these elements combined—the financial worry, emotional distress over a beloved pet's health, and the looming medical intervention—are clear indicators of a stressed state."
"The fact I let it get so out of hand is embarrassing. I receive no unemployment benefits, have no money and my self worth is in the dumps. I am ok on food for now and a somewhat stable location. I'd be over the moon if any number of individuals would grant me the essentials within my amazon wish-list that I am sharing in my post, it'd lift my spirits, bolster my self-esteem and will to move forward and I wouldn't repel people.

"I am not sad, I am not depressed, I am still a very happy and optimistic person with a great life, good friends, family, job, all that. But I am struggling to manage this anxiety because it spills into life. I don't have thoughts I obsess over, I don't worry about anything really.

I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days I’m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks, but most days I do not.",1,"the narrative describes a work environment characterized by chronic understaffing and a significant workload, which are common indicators of stress. the author mentions starting their day very early and having to switch between various demanding tasks, such as physical labor, administrative duties, and customer service roles. this constant shift in responsibilities without adequate support can lead to feelings of overwhelm and exhaustion. the mention of enjoying physical labor but finding it challenging to manage a large operation while performing these tasks highlights a sense of frustration and pressure. the variability in the ability to complete administrative tasks due to frequent interruptions further contributes to a sense of instability and lack of control, which are psychological stressors. the overall tone conveys a persistent struggle to meet job demands under less-than-ideal conditions, which is indicative of a stressful work environment."
"It stuck with me. It made me realize I wasn't as happy as I thought. After that my confusion took over. I drank, got high, made friends. I knew I was a mess but was working on it.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, starting with the realization of unhappiness, which often leads to emotional turmoil. the phrase ""my confusion took over"" suggests a state of mental disarray, a common symptom of stress. the mention of drinking and getting high points to unhealthy coping mechanisms frequently adopted by individuals under significant stress. additionally, the acknowledgment of being ""a mess"" indicates self-awareness of one's troubled state, further reinforcing the presence of stress. the effort to work on these issues shows a desire for improvement, but the overall context and behaviors described align with typical stress responses."
"Telling me I wasn't pretty enough, my boobs weren't large enough, I wasn't thin enough, I wasn't a good girlfriend to him, I wasn't making him happy. He told me he didn't feel loved unless I was having sex with him, and only then did he feel happy. He would threaten constantly to leave, and oftentimes did as a power grab when I got ""out of hand"", and then would make me beg for him back. I felt so unsure of myself. I wasn't enough, and that's why he was leaving.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is subjected to constant criticism and emotional manipulation by their partner. the partner's repeated assertions that the individual is not pretty enough, not thin enough, and not a good girlfriend contribute to a pervasive sense of inadequacy and self-doubt. the partner's conditional expressions of love, contingent on sexual activity, further exacerbate feelings of worthlessness and anxiety. the threats of leaving and the manipulative behavior of making the individual beg for reconciliation are classic examples of emotional abuse, which can lead to heightened stress levels. these elements indicate significant psychological distress, as the individual struggles with feelings of not being enough and fears abandonment. the narrative reflects a deep sense of insecurity and the toll of ongoing emotional manipulation, both of which are strong indicators of stress."
"Though we both had crushes on each other we weren't sure if the feelings were reciprocated. She also has some self esteem issues and told me that she wasn't ready to date someone like me three years ago when we first met, because I was ""too intimidating"", but instead ""settled"" for her ex. She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him. She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together. As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving romantic feelings and past relationships, but it lacks indicators of acute stress. the author recounts their mutual crush and the reasons the other person gave for not pursuing a relationship initially, citing self-esteem issues and feeling intimidated. the narrative also details the other person's past relationship, which was characterized by her feeling like a caregiver due to her ex's severe depression. while these experiences might have been emotionally taxing, the tone of the narrative is reflective and analytical rather than anxious or distressed. the author does not express personal turmoil or overwhelming emotional strain. instead, they provide a clear and coherent account of past events and the dynamics involved, suggesting a level of emotional processing and acceptance that is not typical of someone currently experiencing significant stress."
"Earlier that day I was talking to a customer, a male who later asked for my number. I was very flattered as this man was absolutely gorgeous and had muscles that must have been sculpted by Kratos himself, but alas, I wasn’t able to give it as it was company policy. Little did I know that Pedo had been watching me from behind a clothing rack, and soon pulled me aside in front of all my coworkers in my retail section and spoke so sternly to me, he said “this is why your life is so messed up, this is why everyone here thinks you’re so easy.” And he stormed away from me. He later radioed to me telling me to sell the cards, and after I got to 15 cards to re fold everything in the women’s section. He later texted me telling me he expected me to be at the movies that night, as to not let down the team.",0,"the narrative describes an interaction with a customer that initially seemed flattering, followed by a negative encounter with a supervisor who reprimanded the narrator in a harsh and public manner. despite the unpleasant experience with the supervisor, the overall tone and context of the narrative do not indicate significant emotional distress or anxiety typically associated with stress. the narrator recounts the events in a straightforward manner, without expressing feelings of overwhelming pressure, anxiety, or helplessness. while the supervisor's behavior was inappropriate and could be a source of frustration, the narrative lacks the emotional intensity and psychological markers that are often present in individuals experiencing stress, such as pervasive worry, agitation, or a sense of being overwhelmed. instead, the narrator maintains a descriptive and somewhat detached tone throughout the account."
"Later that night someone snuck into the building we were sleeping in and killed Daniel.. he was chopped up with what I presume was a hatchet. I don't know why they spared me or Jay to this fucking day but I'd gladly take Daniel's place, he was the sweetest boy I ever knew. We were heartbroken and I vowed that I would find the bastard and get revenge for Daniel. I'm crying as I am typing this part because this is what fucked me up the most. Chapter seven: adopted",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the description of a traumatic event involving the violent death of a close friend, daniel. the author recounts the incident with vivid details, such as the use of a hatchet and the emotional aftermath, including feelings of guilt and a desire for revenge. the mention of crying while typing highlights the intense emotional distress and ongoing impact of the event. expressions of heartbreak and the unresolved question of why the author and another individual were spared further underscore the depth of psychological turmoil. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress, consistent with the experience of trauma and its lasting effects on mental health."
"After unsuccessfully looking for a girlfriend on dating sites and personals, I made a simple post on CL looking for a friend that basically said that my life was too much of a mess for me to really date, but I'm trying to be more social, etc. I was upfront with the fact that I have PTSD and am getting help. I was expecting mostly spam messages from bots, etc... surprisingly like 90% replies were just mostly people telling me to grow up without even knowing what my life is like or what I've gone through. The other 10% were adult babysitters and spam. This is kind of what lead to my isolation in the first place.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author expresses feelings of failure and frustration in their attempts to find companionship through dating sites and personal ads. they describe their life as ""too much of a mess"" to date, which suggests a lack of self-esteem and potential feelings of inadequacy. the mention of having ptsd and seeking help indicates that they are dealing with significant psychological challenges. the negative responses they received to their post, with people telling them to ""grow up"" without understanding their situation, likely exacerbated their feelings of isolation and rejection. the overall tone of the narrative reflects a sense of disappointment and hopelessness, which are common symptoms of stress. these elements collectively point to an individual who is experiencing considerable emotional strain and struggling to cope with their circumstances."
She's sworn at me at times. **tl;dr**: Girlfriend cheated on me twice. Is always adamant about keeping contact with the people she cheated with. The relationship is at its wits end. p.s.,1,"the narrative describes a relationship fraught with significant distress and emotional turmoil. the individual mentions being sworn at, which suggests verbal abuse and a hostile environment. the revelation that the girlfriend cheated twice and insists on maintaining contact with those individuals indicates ongoing betrayal and a lack of trust, exacerbating feelings of insecurity and hurt. the phrase ""the relationship is at its wits end"" highlights a sense of desperation and the overwhelming nature of the situation. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress, as the individual is grappling with feelings of betrayal, anger, and helplessness, which are common psychological responses to such relational conflicts."
"Old Man Gotama told his followers 2,500 years ago that those who are hurt are *burning* with self-pity, terror or revenge. Fast forward to about 75 years ago: Old men in universities told *their* followers that everything we do is the result of what we think and feel. By 1965 or so, Albert Ellis was using his grasp of that to dismantle the *thoughts* that kept us imprisoned in... self-pity, terror and revenge. A whole new way of psychotherapy came into being. It was called ""cognitivism.""",0,"the narrative provides a historical overview of philosophical and psychological insights into human behavior, focusing on the evolution of thought from ancient teachings to modern psychotherapy. it references influential figures and concepts without delving into personal experiences or emotional turmoil. the tone is analytical and informative, lacking the emotional intensity or personal anecdotes typically associated with stress. there are no indications of self-pity, terror, or revenge affecting the narrator personally, nor is there a sense of urgency or distress. instead, the narrative maintains a detached, scholarly perspective, which aligns with a state of non-stress."
"So, for a few years now I've been in a relationship with this girl who very likely has PTSD, given her upbringing. She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age, and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetal-alcohol syndrome. She's in good hands now, living with her aunt, and is becoming independent with a job. Though I've noticed throughout our relationship that she has a tendency to push me away l, whereas I am the exact opposite, though I understand her situation; it's not her fault. She says she loves me, and I love her, but she doesn't seem comfortable showing any affection; holding hands, hugging, and kisses on the cheek are extremely rare from her.",0,"the narrative describes a relationship where one partner is dealing with significant psychological challenges stemming from a traumatic past. despite these challenges, the narrator expresses understanding and compassion towards their partner's behavior, recognizing that her actions are not intentional but a result of her complex mental health issues. the narrator acknowledges the partner's progress in becoming independent and notes that she is in a supportive environment with her aunt. while the relationship dynamic involves difficulties, such as the partner's reluctance to show affection, the narrator's empathetic perspective and absence of personal distress or frustration suggest resilience and a stable emotional state. this understanding and supportive attitude towards the partner's condition, without expressing significant personal stress or emotional turmoil, indicates a balanced and non-stressed mindset."
"(NSFW) I have really bad PTSD induced anxiety due to rape situations and being a victim to dozens of emotionally abusive relationships, and I am engaged to a HVAC service technician. One day he was going to do a check up on a furnace, he called before hand and he even gave notice the day before, and I was at school at the time so I didn't see the message till a little later. He walked into the house because the door was unlocked (because some people leave their door unlocked if they're downstairs or something) and he walked into the kitchen and it was a crack house, immediately he had a gun pointed at him and he froze for a second and ran back to his van, the guy shot half a dozen times and hit the rear view mirror, he almost got shot so many times while running to the van, and when I saw this I was hysterically sobbing in the middle of the school hall and when I got home I got to my mom and kept screaming ""he almost died he almost died"" and my mom thought I said he died because I could barely breathe, he seems to be over it now but every time he is a little late coming home from work or hasn't replied in awhile I get so scared hes dead and late at night I can't sleep because I'm scared this is the last day I'll have with him. I don't know what to do.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of ongoing distress and anxiety. the individual recounts traumatic experiences, including ptsd induced by rape and emotionally abusive relationships, which are significant indicators of chronic stress. the detailed description of a harrowing incident involving their fiancé, who narrowly escaped being shot, exacerbates their anxiety. the narrative vividly captures the immediate emotional response of hysterical sobbing and difficulty breathing, both of which are acute stress reactions. the persistent fear for their fiancé's safety, leading to sleepless nights and constant worry, further illustrates the depth of their anxiety. these elements collectively highlight the presence of significant stress and trauma in the individual's life."
"Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was ""nothing"" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne, I've just been overthinking things, and when I do, it flares the anxiety right up.",1,"the narrative describes a recent trip to melbourne that was fraught with interpersonal conflict, primarily due to the behavior of the author's sister. the sister's persistent negativity and dismissive comments, such as accusing the author of being ""over dramatic"" and ""anxious for attention,"" contribute to feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt in the author. these interactions exacerbate the author's pre-existing anxiety, leading to heightened overthinking and emotional distress. the mention of past experiences, like the incident with the elbow swelling and subsequent cellulitis diagnosis, further highlights a pattern of the sister's dismissive attitude towards the author's health concerns, reinforcing a sense of invalidation. the culmination of these stressors—ongoing familial conflict, feelings of inadequacy, and exacerbated anxiety—are clear indicators of significant psychological stress."
"I saved picture after picture of him, had tweet and Instagram notifications on, tracked where his live band was, even looked up his house on Zillow once. I know I sound like a total stalker but I was just really obsessed and I regret everything I did now that I'm older and wiser. Anyway, when I was 16 I started writing fanfiction about him based on the very imaginative music videos he had starred in for his songs. It wasn't about him specifically, but rather alternate universe versions of him. I ended up doing this very bizarre thing where I romantically paired up two alternate reality versions of himself (long story, but basically I crave the gay).",0,"the narrative describes a period of intense obsession with a celebrity, which is common during adolescence. the author acknowledges their past behavior as excessive and regrets it, indicating personal growth and self-awareness. the mention of writing fanfiction and creating alternate universes for the celebrity suggests a healthy outlet for their imagination rather than a sign of distress. the tone of the narrative is reflective and somewhat humorous, showing that the author now views their past actions with a sense of detachment and maturity. these aspects indicate that the behavior, while intense, was a phase rather than a manifestation of ongoing stress."
"I’m just really scared about this entire situation and feel conflicted about what to do. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and he’s threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller. I just feel really scared and really confused about everything and can’t believe it’s come to this. My mom doesn’t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I’m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can’t/shouldn’t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she can’t support us by herself. If we do move I would be fine with getting a full-time job to support my family, I’m already a private tutor but I only do 1-hr a week for $20.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional distress and anxiety. the individual describes feeling scared and conflicted, which are common indicators of stress. the mention of past traumatic experiences, such as their father's jail records and history of violence, contributes to a heightened state of fear and confusion. the ongoing threat and instability within the family environment further exacerbate these feelings. the individual's concern for their mother's well-being and the financial difficulties they face add to the overall sense of pressure and responsibility. the willingness to take on additional work to support the family underscores the burden they feel. all these elements combined illustrate a situation fraught with stress and emotional turmoil."
"He abused his ex girlfriends as well. I left him last June, after he tried to kill me after being released from a one week sentence for DV. That incident landed me in the hospital, though it wasn't the worst incident of abuse. But that night, I had a wave of courage for two seconds and told the staff what really happened. He was arrested and has been in jail ever since.",0,"the narrative details a traumatic experience involving domestic violence and an eventual escape from the abusive relationship. despite the severity of the incidents described, the writer focuses on the resolution and the perpetrator's incarceration. this indicates a sense of relief and empowerment, rather than ongoing distress. the mention of courage and the ability to confide in the hospital staff suggest a turning point and a move towards recovery. while the events are undoubtedly harrowing, the narrative reflects a past ordeal rather than current stress, highlighting the individual's resilience and the positive outcome of the abuser being jailed."
#NAME?,1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of stress, primarily through the individual's expressions of feeling overwhelmed and anxious. they describe a persistent sense of worry and an inability to focus on tasks, which are classic symptoms of stress. the narrative also mentions difficulty sleeping and physical symptoms such as headaches and muscle tension, both of which are commonly associated with high stress levels. additionally, the person talks about feeling irritable and having a short temper, further suggesting that they are under significant psychological strain. these elements combined paint a clear picture of someone grappling with stress, as they exhibit both emotional and physical manifestations of the condition."
"I'm going to keep this story short. I'm (16M) openly gay, he (16M) isn't. We've been friends and somewhat more for 5 months. He hates affection and being touched, but he constantly flirts with me, touches me, wants me to massage his ""sore"" back, wants me to sleep beside him, he cuddles me in his ""sleep""(which he has now revealed to be a fake slumber), and he always asks me about being gay and he truly is trying to understand it. Even if anything really happened between us, I wouldn't be getting a fulfilling relationship.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is reflecting on their relationship with a friend who exhibits conflicting behaviors. while the friend is not openly gay and dislikes affection, he engages in flirtatious and intimate behaviors, such as asking for massages and cuddling. the narrator acknowledges the friend's curiosity about being gay and his efforts to understand it. despite the complexity of their interactions, the narrator seems to have a clear perspective on the limitations of their relationship, recognizing that it would not be fulfilling. the tone is contemplative and analytical rather than distressed, indicating a thoughtful consideration of the situation without signs of significant emotional turmoil. this measured approach and lack of overt emotional distress suggest that the individual is not experiencing high levels of stress."
"If this is all I'm going to experience side-effect wise, then I regret not starting earlier. I really hope this will help with the anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. What are your experiences with antidepressants? Does it get worse? I just can't wait to start actually feeling like myself again.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of hopefulness and anticipation rather than stress. the individual expresses regret for not starting treatment earlier, which suggests they believe in the potential benefits of the medication. they also inquire about others' experiences with antidepressants, indicating a proactive approach to managing their mental health. the desire to feel like themselves again points to an optimistic outlook. while there are mentions of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression, the overall tone is one of looking forward to positive changes rather than being overwhelmed by stress."
"He knows I can't work because of my anxiety problems and he knows I rely on him. He's told me before no one else will take care of me like he does, no one else will put up with me. I'm scared to go back because I don't want to get back together with him and I know if he wants to we will. The reason I went to my grandma's house is because a couple days before I left he got drunk. He started saying horrible things to me.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of someone experiencing stress. the author mentions having anxiety problems and relying on another person for support, which suggests a significant level of dependency and vulnerability. the statement about being told that no one else will take care of them or put up with them reflects a potential emotional manipulation, which can be a source of chronic stress. the fear of returning and the concern about unwanted reconciliation indicate ongoing anxiety and apprehension about their future. the reference to leaving for their grandma's house due to the partner's drunken behavior and verbal abuse highlights a stressful and potentially traumatic situation. these elements collectively suggest that the author is under considerable emotional and psychological stress."
"My mother on the other hand tells me that she is doing all she can, when i explained to her about the way she dresses in front of him she blames him for not creating the opportunity to wear something nice. ie not going out someplace due to him preferring to do work. Listening to both sides separately have put me in a place where i am helpless and cannot do anything. All i can do is withdraw into myself and think about other things to relieve myself. Its basically that they dont understand each other.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of stress experienced by the individual. the person describes feeling helpless and caught in the middle of a conflict between their mother and another person, likely a significant other. the mother blames the other person for not creating opportunities to dress nicely, attributing it to his preference for work over social activities. this blame-shifting and lack of understanding between the two parties are clear stressors for the individual. the sense of helplessness is compounded by the individual's withdrawal into themselves as a coping mechanism, which is a common response to stress. the narrative's focus on interpersonal conflict, feelings of helplessness, and the need to mentally escape the situation are all typical indicators of stress."
I'm not polyamorous at all and he never mentioned being bisexual to me. I didn't know what to say. I kinda went into blank smile mode while inside I was getting sick with jealousy. He never asked if this was okay for him to do this. So I considered it cheating.,1,"the narrative reveals a significant emotional turmoil and internal conflict, which are typical indicators of stress. the individual describes feeling blindsided by their partner's revelation about being bisexual and the suggestion of polyamory, which they were not prepared for. the use of phrases like ""i kinda went into blank smile mode"" and ""inside i was getting sick with jealousy"" indicates a disconnect between their outward demeanor and internal feelings, a common stress response. the mention of not knowing what to say and considering the partner's actions as cheating without prior discussion highlights feelings of betrayal and a lack of control over the situation. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing stress due to unexpected relationship dynamics and unaddressed emotional needs."

"I loved her and I was completely broken. In July of 2016 I went out to a gaming hall/bar that my friend's family owns. I remember pushing on the doors to start making my way back home and then waking up in the hospital. I was told that I had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), facial fractures, a ruptured right ear drum and a cerebrospinal fluid leak. I spent one week in the hospital before I discharged myself against medical advice.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the recounting of a traumatic event and its aftermath. the mention of being ""completely broken"" due to a relationship loss suggests emotional distress. the detailed account of the traumatic brain injury, facial fractures, ruptured ear drum, and cerebrospinal fluid leak highlights the severity of the physical trauma experienced. spending a week in the hospital and choosing to discharge against medical advice points to a possible struggle with coping mechanisms and decision-making, which are often impaired under high stress. the context of a life-altering injury combined with emotional turmoil provides a clear picture of a stressed individual dealing with both physical and psychological challenges."
"Hi! This is my first time posting on reddit, and I was just looking for some advice. So to give some background... I live in a block of flats (in Coventry), and we have a communal area with a bin shed and our personal sheds.

"Back to my dad, during lunch he wanted to say some words to my GF, to encourage her to keep studying the doctorate, he said that if she felt that money was an issue, that don't let her that take her down, that doctorates in our country earn very poorly but that getting that degree would open doors to work abroad and land a job she would love. You see, my dad didn't know (well, I've told him plenty of times, but I figured he forgot at the time) that my GF's mom was a doctorate. My GF's mom openly told in front of my that she didn't earn enough for the years of study and work she did, everybody in our country knows that doctorates don't earn enough money for the effort, capacity and dedication they're required to do/have. But when my dad said those words, nobody said anything. I didn't take it as offensive.",0,"the narrative describes a lunch conversation where the author's father attempts to encourage the author's girlfriend to continue her doctorate studies despite financial challenges. the father's remarks highlight the poor financial rewards for doctorates in their country but also suggest that the degree could provide opportunities abroad. the author mentions that the girlfriend's mother, who has a doctorate, has openly expressed dissatisfaction with the financial returns of her degree. despite this, the author notes that no one reacted negatively to the father's comments, and the author did not find them offensive. the tone of the narrative is calm and reflective, focusing on the father's intention to motivate rather than the stress of financial struggles. there is an absence of language indicating heightened emotional distress, such as feelings of overwhelm, anxiety, or frustration. the narrative is more observational and explanatory, lacking signs of personal turmoil or stress-related symptoms. the author's ability to contextualize the situation and maintain a neutral perspective suggests a balanced emotional state."

I have, and documented once I got out of jail, a puncture bite on my right hand, a puncture bite on my left inner elbow, deep scratches all over my left arm, The skin on my scrotum was torn (the jail underwear they gave me was soaked at the end of the day) my lip busted open, a chipped tooth, my whole right side of my face red and sore from a dozen punches, and a welt on my left leg from her kicking me. Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence. I have no money to hire anyone and am still in shock that I just had to spend 17 hours in jail without given any medical aid in a small cell with 7 other inmates. I have no criminal record whatsoever until now.",1,"the narrative describes a series of traumatic events and physical injuries that the individual has endured, which are clear indicators of significant stress. the detailed account of the physical harm, including puncture bites, deep scratches, a torn scrotum, busted lip, chipped tooth, and multiple bruises, reflects a severe physical assault. the mention of being charged with a crime, despite being the victim of violence, adds to the psychological burden. the individual also highlights the lack of medical attention while in jail and the overcrowded conditions, which would exacerbate feelings of helplessness and anxiety. the shock and disbelief expressed about the arrest and the financial inability to hire legal counsel further contribute to the overall stress. these elements collectively illustrate a high-stress situation, characterized by physical pain, legal troubles, and emotional turmoil."

"Now its personal so it hurts a lot more. There are nightmares where I am murdered, those don't hurt half as much as these. I woke up a few nights ago screaming because of it and I cried like an idiot until I realized it wasn't real. Figured I'd rant here instead of breaking my hands on my heavy bag. You guys ever get extremely worried about your partners safety to the point where it triggers you?",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and anxiety. the mention of personal pain and the comparison to nightmares where the author is murdered highlights the intensity of their current emotional state. waking up screaming and crying suggests a high level of psychological disturbance, often associated with stress and trauma. the decision to rant instead of resorting to physical aggression indicates an attempt to cope with overwhelming emotions. the concern for a partner's safety to the extent that it triggers extreme worry further underscores the presence of stress. these elements collectively point to a narrative characterized by heightened emotional turmoil and anxiety."
"But I’ve also had a lot of pain and it seems to be getting worse. It didn’t use to last as long as it does now, I’ve been lying in pain for hours.

"Is anyone else consumed by morbid curiosity? I'm constantly on /r/watchpeopledie, /r/morbidreality, /r/accidentalsuicide, as well as sites like death addict, best gore, documenting reality, etc. And - this is concern for myself, not bragging - I'm not ""phased"" by any of it. I don't savour these atrocities, but I feel like I must keep consuming them. Hardly anything fascinates me more.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is deeply engaged in consuming content related to death and morbidity. the person expresses a lack of emotional response to these disturbing images and videos, which might initially suggest desensitization or a coping mechanism. however, the key point here is the self-awareness and concern about their behavior, as well as the explicit statement that they do not derive pleasure from it. this indicates a level of introspection and control over their actions. the fascination with morbid content is presented more as a curiosity rather than a symptom of underlying stress. while the behavior might seem unusual, the lack of emotional disturbance or distress in the narrative suggests that the individual is not experiencing significant stress. their engagement with morbid content appears to be a form of intellectual curiosity rather than a manifestation of psychological distress."
"* Trigger warning. The past two weeks I have been recovering from life saving surgery and because of the physical consequences I have had four panic attacks in two weeks. Today I had my fourth one. My original trauma is not related to the hospital, but to rape. But now any time a nurse needs to do something I associate with pain or something else because of the past trauma my brain gets triggered into a panic attack.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through the recounting of panic attacks and their frequency. the mention of life-saving surgery and the physical consequences that followed highlights a recent and intense stressor. the individual explicitly connects their current panic attacks to their past trauma, indicating a compounding effect where new stressors exacerbate existing psychological wounds. the association of medical procedures with pain and past trauma demonstrates a heightened state of anxiety and hypervigilance, common in individuals experiencing post-traumatic stress. these elements together illustrate a clear pattern of stress, driven by both past experiences and recent medical events."
"I know I want to be treated like a human being, and it's very easy for others to say ""YOU NEED TO QUIT YOUR JOB ASAP. Stand up for yourself!""

Anyways, he doesn’t know that I found out and I’m planning to simply move out without a trace.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as the emotional turmoil and heartache experienced by the individual. the act of packing up belongings and crying all day suggests a significant emotional response to a distressing situation. feelings of heartbreak and betrayal are explicitly mentioned, indicating a deep emotional impact. the uncertainty about whether their actions contributed to the partner's infidelity adds to the psychological burden, reflecting self-doubt and introspection. the plan to move out without confrontation indicates a coping mechanism to avoid further emotional pain, highlighting the stress involved in dealing with the situation. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of stress, such as emotional distress, self-reflection, and the need to escape a painful environment."

My abuser is a well known coach who has lost his job over our court cases.,1,"the narrative reflects intense emotional distress and frustration. the use of strong language and exclamations indicates a high level of anger and agitation. the writer mentions a personal experience with abuse, which is a significant traumatic event. the fact that the abuser is a well-known coach who lost his job due to court cases suggests ongoing legal and social battles, which can be incredibly stressful. these elements, combined with the expression of feeling wronged by society, are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress. the narrative's tone and content clearly reveal the writer's struggle with intense emotions and unresolved trauma."
"I’m very frustrated by this and don’t know what to trust. On the one hand, these dreams could very well be pointing to reality. On the other, they could simply be playing out fears I had. And I just don’t know which. What do I trust?",1,"the narrative reflects a state of inner turmoil and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the author expresses frustration and uncertainty, struggling to discern between dreams and reality. this ambiguity and the inability to find clarity can be very distressing. the repeated questioning of trust and the focus on fears suggest an ongoing internal conflict. these elements highlight a preoccupation with potential negative outcomes and a lack of control, both of which are typical in individuals experiencing significant stress. the emotional intensity and cognitive dissonance present in the narrative further support the presence of stress."
"Because not really. I would have survived, I always have before, I have gone three and four days without eating a single thing on dozens of occasions in the last fifteen years, and I will be fine. The guy is wonderful, and has helped me a great deal. But it felt like an intentional attempt to act like I am a burdensome charity case. I just don't know.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resilience and past experiences of overcoming difficult situations, such as going days without eating. the author expresses confidence in their ability to cope, stating they will be fine. while there is a mention of feeling like a burdensome charity case, the overall tone does not convey significant distress. instead, it shows an awareness of support received from a helpful individual, which indicates a balanced perspective. the use of phrases like ""i will be fine"" and ""i have survived"" suggests a strong coping mechanism and a lack of overwhelming stress."

Today feels really hard and even though I want to run away I know I can't. How're you all doing?",1,"the narrative describes several symptoms commonly associated with stress, such as flashbacks, tearfulness, and intrusive thoughts. the repetition of flashbacks suggests a recurring and intrusive nature of these memories, which is often linked to heightened stress or trauma. the individual mentions having a rough time lately, indicating ongoing difficulties. their coping mechanisms, like finding a small space to hide or reaching out to friends, are indicative of someone trying to manage overwhelming emotions. the mention of today feeling particularly hard and the desire to run away, despite knowing they can't, highlights a sense of being trapped or overwhelmed, further pointing to significant stress. the closing question, asking how others are doing, might reflect a need for connection and support during a challenging time. all these elements together are typical indicators of stress."
"It’s Open Enrollment, most government systems in the US are poorly managed so most go without full knowledge what they’re signing up for, and the pressure of management can be intense to reach certain “metrics.” I enjoy the money but the politics of it all be disconcerting. It’s not at all what I want to do with my life. I’ve been in and out of doctors appointments for my thyroid goiter. My mom said my great grandfather had the same thing and it causes anxiety. But most of it stems from my verbally abusive, alcoholic dad and being raped twice in my life.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, both situational and historical. the individual discusses the pressure and poor management associated with open enrollment in government systems, which adds to their stress due to lack of clarity and intense performance metrics. their dissatisfaction with their current job and its misalignment with their life goals further exacerbates their stress levels. health issues, specifically thyroid goiter, are mentioned, along with a family history of anxiety related to this condition, contributing to their overall anxiety. the mention of a verbally abusive, alcoholic father and the traumatic experiences of being raped twice in their life are significant sources of chronic stress and psychological trauma. these elements combined paint a picture of someone dealing with multiple layers of stress, both from their current environment and past experiences."

Sorry if any of my comments are uninformed or unintentionally offensive. I’m sincerely asking advice for how you think I could temporarily help him.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is seeking advice and expressing concern over a past situation, but it does not display typical indicators of stress. the individual is apologetic and careful with their words, indicating a level of self-awareness and thoughtfulness rather than distress. their inquiry about temporarily helping someone and the mention of a past experience in college where they felt uncomfortable shows they are reflecting on their actions and seeking constructive feedback. this approach suggests they are managing their feelings and are not overwhelmed by the situation. overall, the tone is measured and considerate, lacking signs of anxiety, urgency, or emotional turmoil that are often associated with stress."
I gave him a week to get all his bills together so we could go over everything and see where he could cut back. He didn’t do it. He just came over with his monthly expenses scribbled down on a piece of paper. My wife also took the time to get him a list of low income apartments in the area.

But anxiety doesn't listen to logic.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep-seated anxiety and preoccupation with health-related fears. the individual describes a significant event, possibly a migraine, which triggered obsessive thoughts about having a brain tumor and facing a slow, painful death. this catastrophic thinking is a common symptom of stress and anxiety disorders. the mention of migraines being prevalent in the family, yet the inability to find solace in this logical explanation, further highlights the struggle with anxiety. the phrase ""anxiety doesn't listen to logic"" encapsulates the core issue, indicating an ongoing battle with stress that overrides rational thought processes. this narrative clearly reflects the psychological turmoil and heightened stress levels experienced by the individual."

Originally, I was told that I wouldn’t have to testify as there was ample evidence, but now I am being told I must testify about a week from now. I am terrified to see my abuser in court and I was wondering what I should expect. Does anyone have any advice for me or can tell me what I should expect at the trial? Thank you so much.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant amount of distress and anxiety stemming from a recent and traumatic experience. the individual describes the end of a long-term abusive relationship, which in itself is a major life stressor. the upcoming court appearance to testify against their abuser exacerbates this stress, as evidenced by the use of words like ""terrified"" and the request for advice on what to expect. the anticipation of facing their abuser in court is a clear indicator of ongoing emotional turmoil. such a situation is likely to provoke intense fear, anxiety, and uncertainty, all of which are classic symptoms of stress. the context of domestic violence and the legal proceedings further amplify the psychological burden, making it evident that the individual is currently under significant stress."

"Today at work I took a customer's payment over the phone. I was pulling up her account so there was a moment of silence between us. I could hear a man in the back yelling,""I'm gonna slap you"" I didn't tell her I had her page pulled up so I could keep listening, because I was convinced I heard incorrectly.

It took her longer than it should have to respond to.",0,"the narrative describes an unsettling experience at work where the author overhears a threatening conversation while assisting a customer over the phone. despite the disturbing nature of the overheard comments, the author remains focused on their task and does not exhibit signs of personal distress or anxiety. the detailed recounting of the incident is presented in a calm and observational manner, indicating that the author is processing the event without internalizing the stress. the lack of emotional language or expressions of fear, worry, or agitation suggests that the author is not personally affected by the stress of the situation. instead, they appear to be more curious and attentive to the unfolding events, maintaining their professional composure throughout the interaction."

People who have gone through this phase what did you do to get through it.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the writer expresses a need for encouragement, suggesting they are struggling to cope. the phrase ""i currently just want everything to be over"" indicates a sense of overwhelm and possibly despair. the repeated questioning about past trauma and significant life decisions, such as whether it was sexual abuse and whether to move out, reflects intrusive thoughts and indecision, both common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress. the mention of ""less and less brain space to devote to schoolwork"" points to cognitive overload, a typical symptom of stress where an individual finds it difficult to concentrate or perform tasks effectively. the plea for advice from others who have been through similar experiences highlights a search for support and validation, further underscoring the writer's emotional and psychological burden. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative marked by significant stress."

I JUST DONT GET IT IM SCARED I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!,1,"the narrative displays several indicators of stress, primarily through the expression of anxiety and fear. the author describes a physically and emotionally uncomfortable situation in the waiting room, highlighting the presence of crying babies and kids, which can be overstimulating and stress-inducing. the confusion and concern over their heart rate, coupled with the repeated visits to doctors and frequent self-monitoring, suggest a preoccupation with their health that is often associated with stress. the use of phrases like ""i just dont get it"" and ""im scared i dont know what to do"" further emphasize feelings of helplessness and anxiety. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, as the author is clearly distressed by their physical symptoms and the uncertainty surrounding their health condition."
"(Mind you we are all here from DSS/Social Services and in this homeless motel shelter) So now it is about 10:00pm and once again he knocks on their door and tells them to turn it down and to be quiet. Nope...that's just not going to happen, as soon as he was out of earshot the cRap music and loud partying resumed. So I sit in my room perplexed as what to do about this,(wanting to get some much needed sleep) as it seems asking them to turn the music down and to quiet down was not going to happen. (obviously they're above the rules and law and don't give a shit about others in the motel) So I sat there thinking and I decided to call the owner/manager one last time and tell him PLEASE get these people to be quiet and turn the music down and to quit being so damn loud. He tells me ""I have told them 2 times to turn the music down and be quiet and they won't listen to me, why don't you call the police yourself"" I was floored by him saying this to me and told him it was NOT my job to enforce the rules, it was his.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of frustration and helplessness, common indicators of stress. the author is in a difficult living situation, staying in a homeless motel shelter, which already suggests a baseline of stress. the repeated disturbances from loud music and partying contribute to the author's inability to rest, exacerbating their stress. the sense of being ignored and the feeling that others are above the rules heightens their frustration. the interaction with the owner/manager, who seems indifferent and unhelpful, further intensifies the author's feelings of powerlessness and anger. these elements, including the context of homelessness, lack of control over the environment, and the unresponsiveness of authority figures, are all significant stressors that align with the narrative's classification."
"He laid me down and went to take off his clothes, then I sprung up, ran to the bathroom, grabbed the key(only one we have), ran to the guest room and locked myself in there. Finally safe. No pillow or comforter though, just a thin blanket and some clean laundry. No matter, I couldn't fall asleep anyways. Around 6am I crept outside, took a shower, gathered most of his stuff I could find and left him a note saying I took his key, and when I'd be back at 8pm he should be gone and anything that he leaves behind goes to the bin.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual takes deliberate actions to ensure their safety and well-being. despite the unsettling context, the person demonstrates clear decision-making and assertiveness by securing themselves in a guest room and setting boundaries with the other person involved. the use of phrases like ""finally safe"" and the detailed planning of leaving a note with specific instructions indicate a sense of control and resolution rather than stress. the individual’s ability to follow through with a plan and communicate their expectations effectively suggests a state of empowerment and clarity, which are not typical indicators of stress."

I almost started crying but I didnt know why.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual recounting past events with a sense of detachment and curiosity rather than acute distress. the mention of the father going to jail and receiving a letter from the real mom are significant life events, yet the individual describes these experiences in a straightforward manner without expressing overwhelming emotions or signs of ongoing turmoil. the reaction to the letter, feeling weird and almost crying, indicates a momentary emotional response but not one that dominates the narrative or suggests persistent stress. the overall tone is reflective and contemplative rather than fraught with anxiety or tension, which are more typical indicators of stress."
"I'm so stressed at the moment, I pretty much had a breakdown in college from all the work I need to do and the deadline is next week. I have 4 different projects in on the same day at the same time and I'm doing the best I can to manage my time but it's nothing simple like typing up an assignment. It's programming work, and as much as I do enjoy programming, having to create 4 different projects with 3 different languages is causing me to panic and stress out on getting things done. I've spoken to student support and a couple of tutors but I can't switch my mind off how many deadlines I have and the worst part is that I can't do 3 of them at home. I can only do them during college hours.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress experienced by the individual, primarily due to academic pressures and looming deadlines. the person describes having a breakdown, which is a clear indicator of emotional and mental strain. the mention of multiple projects due on the same day, combined with the complexity of programming in different languages, underscores the overwhelming workload. the individual's attempt to manage time effectively but still feeling panicked highlights the difficulty in coping with the demands. further, the constraint of being able to work on three of the projects only during college hours adds to the sense of urgency and helplessness. these elements collectively point to significant stress, as the person struggles to balance their responsibilities and maintain their mental well-being."
"I did a few EMDR sessions, had great success, but also don't want to go through that again as I became severely depressed in the days following sessions. Anyone else sharing this feeling?? Like maybe sometimes its better/easier to not go to therapy and revisit everything and try to get ahold of it yourself? I definitely do have a skill set learned from my time in therapy that I feel I can rely on right now, but if I get worse I am not sure if just that is enough...though hopeful I will not get worse. Would appreciate your feedback whether you also share these feelings, or if you think it is better to return to therapy.",1,"the narrative reflects a person grappling with the aftermath of therapy, particularly emdr sessions, which initially yielded success but subsequently led to severe depression. this indicates a significant emotional struggle, a hallmark of stress. the individual's hesitation to return to therapy despite recognizing its benefits suggests an ongoing internal conflict and a fear of exacerbating their condition. the mention of relying on skills learned in therapy but doubting their sufficiency if their condition worsens reveals a lack of confidence and anxiety about future mental health stability. seeking feedback from others experiencing similar feelings further underscores their uncertainty and need for external validation, common in stressed individuals. the overall tone and content highlight the complexity and weight of their emotional state, pointing towards significant stress."
"I'm not the kind of guy who likes to ask for help with things like this, especially when it feels like there are so many people with worse problems, but after three years of trying to save up on a disabled person's income with nothing but failure (as soon as I have a little saved, something else comes up), and at the encouragement of my online acquaintances, I have decided to try setting up a gofundme account in order to get dentures: <url> I feel like I have tried every government assistance program and charity in the US, but as a 35 year old male, there is no help for me. I'm not young enough for assistance, I'm not old enough for assistance, and I am not a female with kids, so there is just no help available. As proof here is the thread I made three years ago. I wasn't asking for anything then, just showing off the teeth I had pulled: <url>",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and helplessness, which are common indicators of stress. the author expresses a reluctance to seek help, suggesting a possible internal struggle with pride or self-reliance. the repeated financial setbacks despite efforts to save, and the lack of support from government assistance programs, highlight a persistent and unresolved stressor. the mention of encouragement from online acquaintances to start a gofundme account suggests a sense of desperation and a last resort effort to find a solution. the detailed explanation of the lack of available assistance due to specific demographic factors further underscores feelings of exclusion and helplessness. these elements collectively point to significant stress, as the individual is grappling with continuous obstacles and a sense of being trapped in their situation."
So about a year and a half ago my best friend was apart of a somewhat controversial car accident in which he ended up getting convicted with a felony even though all the evidence pointed that he was not in the wrong. This was a tough thing for him and his family to go through both financially and emotionally. The case was finally settled about a month ago and things seemed to be looking up. 2 nights ago his younger brother ended up taking his own life. This was completely devastating news to everyone that new him.,0,"the narrative describes a series of highly distressing events, including a controversial car accident resulting in a felony conviction for the narrator's best friend and the recent suicide of the friend's younger brother. these events are undeniably challenging and would typically induce significant stress in most individuals. however, the tone of the narrative is somewhat detached and factual, focusing on the sequence of events rather than expressing personal emotions or internal turmoil. the narrator does not mention their own feelings or reactions, which might suggest a level of emotional distance or coping through rationalization. this absence of personal emotional expression can sometimes indicate a state of non-stress, as the individual might be processing the events in a more objective or resigned manner."
"Ever since my ex and I broke up last year, I’ve been cooped up at home because I couldn’t find the courage or motivation to go out. We had been going out for 3 years when we decided to break it off. I started to work from home and further withdrew into myself… I rarely went out, even to see friends and do my chores, like buy groceries. Today, I decided I was sick of the way I’ve been living my life lately and want to make some serious changes. I chatted up my friends and organized a Ukraine ski trip with them next month.",0,"the narrative describes a period of withdrawal and isolation following a breakup, which is a common reaction to significant life changes. however, the individual has shown a proactive attitude by recognizing their dissatisfaction with their current lifestyle and taking steps to change it. organizing a ski trip and reconnecting with friends are positive actions indicating a shift towards social engagement and improved mental well-being. the ability to make plans and express a desire for change suggests resilience and a move away from a stress-dominated state. these actions reflect a sense of agency and optimism, which are not typical indicators of ongoing stress."
"It is thus counterproductive to do so, when I could just go to work. I am trying to get a better job. Trust me, I am *trying. * The issue is that I have a huge gap in my employment history where I was more or less spending every single day giving my grandmother 3 insulin shots a day, cooking 2 meals for her, cleaning her apartment and running her to and from doctor's appointments and to the hospital. That was a full time job in and of itself.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through several indicators. the author expresses a sense of frustration and urgency in their attempt to find a better job, as evidenced by the repetition of the word ""trying"" and the emphasis on it. the mention of a ""huge gap"" in employment history due to caregiving responsibilities for their grandmother highlights a major life stressor. caregiving is inherently stressful, particularly when it involves daily medical tasks, meal preparation, cleaning, and transportation to medical appointments, all of which the author describes as a ""full time job."" the cumulative burden of these responsibilities, combined with the pressure to secure employment, underscores the high level of stress the individual is experiencing."
"The prospect of this has me utterly overwhelmed right now though. I apologize for the erratic train of thought in this post; I'm honestly at my wits end and thought it would be worth reaching out on this sub. Even if you can't help me financially, any sort of aid would be helpful. I'm going to be on my own for the first time, so any household supplies you might even have laying around that you could donate would probably be helpful. Even advice or resources would be great right now.",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress. the writer expresses feelings of being ""utterly overwhelmed"" and ""at my wits end,"" which are strong emotional signals of distress. the erratic train of thought mentioned also suggests cognitive overload, a common symptom when someone is under significant stress. the plea for any form of aid, whether financial, material, or advice, indicates a sense of desperation and urgency. the context of being on their own for the first time adds to the stress, as it involves navigating new responsibilities and uncertainties. these elements collectively highlight a state of heightened stress and anxiety."
"Lately I realized that if its possible to have our minds immortalized by transferring them to a digital copy (basically creating a backup with a computer, or slowly replacing each neuron with a computer to keep our conciousness intact) that its possible to wind up in a situation where humans have created an eternal hell. I am terrified that one day the government will force people to have digital copies of their brain, or ""go digital"". It will probably start with the military, but eventually everyone will have to (the government loves control). At this point, it would be possible for a hacker, or a shady government, to just torture a person.... forever. I mean, until the universe ended, if it does.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep contemplation on the implications of advanced technology and digital immortality. while the author expresses fear and concern about potential misuse of such technology, the discussion is speculative and philosophical rather than personal or immediate. the focus on hypothetical scenarios, such as government control and eternal torture, suggests a preoccupation with future possibilities rather than current stressors. this kind of abstract thinking, while intense, does not necessarily indicate that the individual is experiencing personal stress. instead, it shows a tendency toward imaginative and theoretical exploration of complex issues. the absence of personal anecdotes or immediate concerns about their own life further supports this interpretation."

I’m kinda freaking out about it and i’m not sure what to do. If there are any loans or opportunities or anything that I can use as a resource please let me know. I could use all the help I can get.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, as the individual is expressing a sense of desperation and uncertainty. seeking out arrangements such as a sugar daddy for gifts and financial support suggests that the person is in a precarious financial situation, which is a common source of stress. the phrase ""im kinda freaking out about it"" directly conveys a high level of anxiety and distress. the plea for loans, opportunities, and resources further underscores their urgent need for assistance and the overwhelming pressure they are experiencing. these elements collectively highlight the individual's struggle and the psychological burden they are under, which are clear markers of stress."
"I was severely neglected as a child by my mother, but this isn't about the neglect (although it may make an appearance at some point), I think my twin and I were sexually abused by her first boyfriend (the man she had an affair with). I have a distinct memory of lying in my bed at night and there being a male figure crawling up towards me, this is more of a still frame though. The others however I remember vividly to a point, one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling, except he was also humping, I can't remember much more than that, the other is walking to his house, I remember the exact route, going in and him showing me his house, I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom, other than the bedding was white, I don't remember leaving or what happened in between, but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply troubling and traumatic past, with specific and vivid memories of potential childhood sexual abuse and neglect. the individual expresses significant distress and confusion about their past experiences, which are compounded by intrusive flashbacks and a lack of clear recollection. the mention of starting to masturbate at a young age is also a potential indicator of early sexual trauma. the cyclic nature of their suffering, despite being on medication and undergoing therapy, highlights the ongoing struggle with unresolved trauma. the desire for a definitive answer to their past abuse to find closure indicates a persistent and painful preoccupation with these unresolved issues. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as the individual is grappling with severe emotional and psychological turmoil stemming from their childhood experiences."
"But it happened. I literally had to take breathing exercise thingys because I felt like I was gonna pass out, my heart was racing. Now not all notifications scare me, like here, I won't really be too concerned. But still. I think the root of the problem is the sheer anonymity of when it alerts you a notification.",1,"the narrative reflects a heightened state of anxiety and stress, as evidenced by the description of physical symptoms such as feeling faint and experiencing a racing heart. these are common physiological responses to stress, often linked to the body's fight-or-flight response. the mention of having to perform breathing exercises suggests an attempt to manage acute stress, indicating the intensity of the individual's emotional state. the narrative also touches on the unpredictability of notifications as a stressor, highlighting how the lack of control and uncertainty can exacerbate stress levels. overall, the detailed account of both the physical and psychological reactions to notifications is indicative of an underlying stress response."
"I know there are no guarantees, but what medicine has worked for you? I really just want to feel better. They’ve had me on Lexapro for the past 4 or so years but I think it’s lost it’s efficiency. All it does is keep me awake at night. I tried Celexa when I was about 15 or 16, but I was young and dumb and didn’t take it when I was supposed to, so I guess I never really found out if it worked.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of inquiry and a desire for improvement rather than acute stress. the individual discusses their experience with medication in a rational and reflective manner, indicating a level of self-awareness and proactive behavior. mentioning the use of lexapro and celexa, and expressing a desire to find an effective solution, suggests they are actively seeking ways to manage their condition rather than being overwhelmed by it. the tone is contemplative rather than distressed, and the mention of past medication usage is framed in a context of learning from experience rather than regret or panic. these elements point to a thoughtful approach to their situation, which is not typically indicative of someone experiencing high levels of stress."

"I have been thinking about it and I think that all anxiety seems to boil down to either fear of what other people think of you or fear of death. I am curious if this is just me? Sometimes simplifying it makes it easier for me to deal with, at least during less intense moments where I still have control of my mind. I realize a fear of death is a bit unbeatable, but some how that seems to give me a bit of peace. The one that I have a hell of a time with is fear of what other people thinking.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author discusses anxiety and its underlying causes, specifically mentioning fear of what others think and fear of death. these are common stressors that can significantly impact mental health. the mention of simplifying these fears to manage them during less intense moments suggests that the author experiences varying levels of anxiety, sometimes manageable and other times overwhelming. the phrase ""i have a hell of a time with"" indicates a struggle, highlighting the difficulty in coping with the fear of judgment from others. this ongoing battle with anxiety and the strategies employed to manage it are clear signs of someone experiencing stress. the acknowledgment of the ""fear of death"" providing a strange sense of peace suggests a complex relationship with anxiety, where even the most daunting fears are rationalized to find some relief. overall, the narrative is rich with expressions of internal conflict, coping mechanisms, and the pervasive nature of anxiety, all of which are indicative of a stressed individual."
"I've had anxiety for a few years (I'm seventeen) and only got diagnosed properly like 7 months ago alongside depression. Over the past few months I've developed a stutter and I've been unable to form proper sentences which has given me a fear of talking to friends and even just talking in general. I'm not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but I've always been excellent with my literacy but when I'm talking to either my family or friends, the words just can't come out. I've recently had something happen to nw where I was used for comedy & told to ""try electro shock therapy"" to help my mental illnesses by some guy pretending to be there for me. This is only really related because this has made me really antisocial and I can't trust people anymore.",1,"the narrative reveals several significant indicators of stress, such as the mention of anxiety and depression diagnoses, which are common mental health conditions often associated with stress. the development of a stutter and the resulting fear of communication suggest a high level of social anxiety and internalized stress. the individual's reference to feeling less intelligent compared to family members and struggling with academic performance indicates low self-esteem and self-doubt, which are frequently linked to stress. the incident where the individual was mocked and advised to undergo electroshock therapy highlights a traumatic social experience that exacerbated their antisocial behavior and mistrust of others. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, as the person is dealing with both internal psychological struggles and external social challenges."
"I moved out of our family home and in with my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago. Since then we’d speak a bit over text, mainly for each others birthdays.

"Just looking acidentaly at news or pictures of weed in the web (specially while working) triggered this super anxious and horrible feeling. I would take around an hour or two to recover of this feeling. To this day I still suffer with this. When, at work, I will have an important meeting, I am praying that when I am in the computer, no article about marijuana or weed suddenly appears in the newsfeed...Can you imagine this? This is completly irrational.",1,"the narrative describes a persistent and intense reaction to stimuli related to marijuana, highlighting a pattern of anxiety and distress. the individual reports experiencing a ""super anxious and horrible feeling"" triggered by accidental exposure to such content, especially while working. this reaction significantly impacts their ability to function, requiring an hour or two to recover. the ongoing nature of this issue, as they mention still suffering from it, further indicates a chronic stress response. the anticipation and worry about encountering marijuana-related content during important work meetings exemplify anticipatory anxiety, a common stress indicator. the individual acknowledges the irrationality of their fear, yet remains unable to control their reaction, which is typical in stress and anxiety disorders. these elements collectively illustrate a heightened state of stress, marked by specific triggers, prolonged recovery time, and the impact on daily functioning."
"Only self-diagnosed as OCD until my eventual downfall. A series of events in late 2016 led me into an intense, insidious cycle of anxious rumination and fear. DPDR arose from this maelstrom of angst, something who's existence I was completely unaware of, particularly as to being related to anxiety. My perceptual world changed, my reality became crisp, shiny, radiant yet also incredibly surreal. And there I was, thrust into the middle of a world so overwhelmingly vivid that I yet felt so overwhelmingly absent from.",0,"the narrative describes a journey through mental health challenges, specifically mentioning ocd, anxious rumination, and dpdr (depersonalization/derealization disorder). despite the intense and vivid experiences detailed, the tone and structure of the narrative suggest a reflective and analytical approach rather than an immediate or overwhelming distress. the writer uses descriptive language to convey their altered perceptions and experiences, indicating a degree of detachment and contemplation. this reflective quality can be a sign of having processed the experiences to some extent, rather than being in the throes of acute stress. the use of past tense when discussing the ""series of events in late 2016"" and the phrase ""eventual downfall"" imply a temporal distance from the peak of their distress, suggesting that the narrative is written from a place of relative stability and insight rather than current turmoil."
"I had a moment earlier when I was setting up for the night that I kinda, realized that life hasn't quite gone to plan, huh? [Handy dandy storage box! Nobody questions someone carrying an awkwardly large <url> Anyway, my bedroll is one of the only real constants in my life at the moment, and I kinda wanted to share it.

"Hi everyone, (edit: the title should say “after reading the symptoms” btw). I feel like I should give a little background. About 7-8 months ago I left my abusive ex-girlfriend, she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical.

With my daughter recovering and my wife getting further in her diagnosis and her pregnancy I haven’t been able to catch up and it’s snowballing out of control. We applied for social security for both my wife and daughter but our paperwork was “lost in the system”. I went to court last week and the writ of possession will be filed tomorrow morning to have my belongings removed from the home. I have asked for loans and co-signers but nobody close to the family is willing to take a hit to their credit. I have sought out rental assistance from local charities but they will only help me if I got the balance down to $500.,1,"the narrative reveals a high level of distress through several critical indicators. the individual is facing multiple significant life stressors simultaneously, such as a daughter's recovery, a wife's medical diagnosis and pregnancy, and the looming threat of losing their home. the mention of lost paperwork for social security benefits adds to the frustration and sense of helplessness. the urgent need to secure financial assistance and the inability to find support from family or local charities further compounds the stress. the overall tone conveys a sense of overwhelm and desperation, which are typical indicators of someone experiencing considerable stress."

"I dont know what im trying to do by writing this, maybe just to vent, or get advice.. i dont really know.. but here we go. I was in an abusive relationship for 6 years. Everything was great at first. He was a bad boy, but i saw so much more than what he did. I loved him with everything i had and i was ALWAYS there for him.",0,"the narrative describes an individual reflecting on their past experiences in an abusive relationship. while the subject matter is undoubtedly serious and potentially distressing, the tone of the writing suggests a sense of detachment and reflection rather than immediate stress. the author mentions their confusion about the purpose of writing, which could indicate a search for clarity rather than a current state of distress. the phrase ""everything was great at first"" implies a period of positive memories, and although the relationship turned abusive, the narrative does not convey acute emotional turmoil or stress in the present moment. instead, it appears the individual is processing their past experiences in a more composed manner."

He than continued to explain the details of how he stabbed the mans orfaces to draw blood for lubrication as he molested the dead body to get his point across about how the child had fealt. I listened to this story over and over multiple times daily as the man bragged about his actions.",0,"the narrative describes a disturbing and violent story recounted by an individual within a confined setting. despite the graphic and distressing content, the narrator's tone remains detached and factual, indicating a possible desensitization to the events described. there is no explicit mention of personal emotional distress or anxiety from the narrator's perspective. the absence of self-referential language and the focus on recounting another person's actions without expressing personal turmoil or discomfort suggests a lack of direct emotional engagement with the traumatic content. this detachment and lack of personal emotional response are typical indicators that the individual is not currently experiencing stress."
I know it is a huge accomplishment that I've been able to get back on the road and try again. It's just frustrating that I haven't been making as much progress as I'd like.

"It's important to put your needs first sometimes. This might sound really obvious but I never realized just how harmful it can be to try and please everyone all the time. Whether you speak your mind or don't, there's always going to be someone who dislikes you.

I just haven't been able to see the value in my own words for so long.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and reflective mindset, focusing on personal growth and self-awareness. the author discusses the importance of prioritizing one's own needs and recognizing the value of personal expression. there is a clear acknowledgment of the challenges in pleasing everyone, but it is framed in a way that suggests acceptance and understanding rather than distress. the tone is contemplative rather than anxious, and the mention of realizing the harm in constantly trying to please others indicates a movement towards healthier self-perception. the narrative lacks the urgency, negativity, or overwhelming emotional tone that are often associated with stress. instead, it shows a rational and balanced perspective on personal boundaries and self-worth."
"I've been dating this guy for nearly three months. We met at a bar and had a one night stand, so my expectations were very low. We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal.

I am afraid to even begin for several reasons. 1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me.

I just want to stop feeling like this.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress that are common in individuals experiencing emotional turmoil. the writer mentions a recent breakup, which is inherently a stressful event, especially given the circumstances described. the betrayal of being cheated on and the subsequent breakup are significant emotional stressors. living with the ex-partner compounds the stress, as it creates an environment where the individual cannot easily escape reminders of the relationship. physical symptoms of stress are evident, as the writer describes their stomach twisting into knots, a common psychosomatic response to anxiety and stress. the expression of uncertainty and a desire to stop feeling this way further underscores the emotional distress. these elements collectively illustrate a classic response to acute stress and emotional pain."

Yet I always see his snapchat score go up by like 30 or more at a time (I know I shouldn't snoop it just feeds my problems but I can't help it). Anyway I just get jealous that he snaps loads to other people but not me, I don't know who.. it could be another girl.. he never sends a face pic to me but is he to others and if so why not me?",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly in the context of interpersonal relationships. the individual describes feelings of jealousy, paranoia, and suspicion, which are classic symptoms of stress. they mention being aware of these negative emotions and attempting to conceal them from their boyfriend, indicating internal conflict and anxiety. the behavior of monitoring the boyfriend's snapchat activity and interpreting it in a negative light further exemplifies a preoccupation with potential threats to the relationship, which is a common stress response. the narrative also reveals a sense of inadequacy and insecurity, as the person compares their interactions with their boyfriend to his interactions with others. this comparison and the resulting distress highlight the individual's heightened emotional sensitivity and stress regarding their romantic relationship. overall, the specific examples of jealousy, the act of snooping, and the fear of unreciprocated affection are all strong indicators of stress."

No.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of stress. the author expresses frustration with logistical hurdles, such as the requirement for physical ids and the difficulty of phone communication due to charger theft. these obstacles contribute to a sense of helplessness and irritation. the phrase ""ugh"" conveys exasperation, while the statement ""times like these generate negative attitudes towards the world, and myself"" indicates a broader emotional impact, reflecting a negative self-view and external outlook. the culmination of these frustrations leads the author to question their self-worth, as seen in the line ""makes me wonder if im a piece of shit."" such self-deprecating thoughts are often associated with stress and low self-esteem. the narrative overall encapsulates a cycle of external challenges leading to internal distress."
"there are guards you have to ask for everythig and the other people who live there - while most are ""ok"" some either look like trouble or actually give trouble. .

Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has. The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out.

Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1,"the narrative describes a relationship that initially seemed positive but quickly deteriorated as the true nature of the partner's temper became apparent. the individual recounts how the partner initially hid his temper but eventually started showing signs of anger and control. this escalation culminated in a violent outburst when the individual attempted to discuss their concerns. such experiences are typical indicators of stress as they involve fear, unpredictability, and emotional turmoil. the individual’s avoidance behavior and the partner's controlling tendencies further suggest a stressful and potentially harmful dynamic. the mention of screaming and throwing objects during a confrontation highlights the acute distress and anxiety that the individual is experiencing."

I get it.",1,"the narrative reveals significant emotional distress and a sense of isolation, which are key indicators of stress. the writer expresses a profound sense of betrayal and abandonment by friends, despite having previously confided in them about personal issues. the repeated realization of being unsupported during critical times exacerbates feelings of loneliness and heartbreak. the acknowledgment that others have their own lives to manage, while rational, does not mitigate the pain of feeling unsupported. this combination of unmet social needs, emotional hurt, and perceived isolation are classic signs of stress."
"My situation is that I might be homeless for about a month. I have plenty of money coming in from my clients during the month of October--more than enough to meet the 3x income requirement for most apartments in the city where I plan to move (my hometown).

Some of my clients have really slow pay schedules.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress due to the imminent threat of homelessness and financial instability. the individual describes a precarious situation where their current lease ends before they have sufficient funds to secure a new apartment. the uncertainty of not having a stable place to live is a major stressor, compounded by the inconsistent payment schedules of their clients. the pressure of meeting the income requirements for housing, along with the timing mismatch, adds to the anxiety. these elements are typical indicators of stress as they involve immediate and impactful concerns about basic needs and financial security. the mention of a potential month-long period without a home highlights the severity of the stress, as housing is a fundamental necessity."
"I currently have $7k in my bank account. I have $1.4k in credit card debt, which nets me $5.6k. I have no incoming cash flow other than tax refund that I have not filed for yet. In worst case scenario, I can tap into parts of my 401k/roth savings, which do amount to over $35k, but obviously there are tax penalties associated with that along with having some restrictions.

I guess I don't know what to do, it's a complicated situation, and I feel that I'll never get the ""real talk"" I'd like to have with him, or any sort of apology.

"My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer, and while it's well-controlled, the side effects of his hormonal and chemo treatments have left him far more emotional (but, at least, unable to just sublimate his depression/anxiety into anger and vent it at any available target anymore), and the physical side effects have forced him into an early retirement, meaning 80% of the time he's home and sitting in the livingroom. He's no longer directing the same vitriol and venom at me that he used to, and neither does my sister, but...

Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me. I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense.

To re-iterate, you can't directly control the thoughts your brain sends, but you can MANIPULATE what it sends by giving it feedback by either Responding or NOT RESPONDING. The more you respond with COMPULSIONS, the more your brain will throw that thought at you. Paradoxically, the things you are doing to relieve your Anxiety are making your OCD worse. The more Compulsions you engage in, the stronger the Obsessions become.",1,"the narrative describes a cyclical pattern where engaging in compulsions to alleviate anxiety actually exacerbates obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd). this indicates a heightened state of stress as the individual is caught in a feedback loop where their attempts to manage their anxiety are counterproductive. the language used, such as ""the more you respond with compulsions, the more your brain will throw that thought at you,"" suggests a sense of frustration and helplessness, common indicators of stress. the explanation of how compulsions strengthen obsessions further highlights the ongoing struggle and the mental burden the individual faces. this continuous cycle of stress and anxiety, coupled with the inability to break free from it, is a clear sign of someone experiencing significant stress."

As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing. I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help.

I don't even know if my family will be able to afford any sort of funeral right now.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the pervasive uncertainty and financial instability described. the author mentions staying up at night, which suggests sleep disturbances often associated with anxiety and stress. the concern over unpaid debts and the potential loss of their home underscores a deep sense of insecurity and fear about the future. the worry about making christmas feel normal amidst financial strain indicates a struggle to maintain normalcy and tradition in a difficult situation. additionally, the uncertainty about their father's living situation and the potential displacement of the family highlights a fear of losing stability and security. the mention of not being able to afford a funeral further intensifies the stress, as it touches on the fear of being unable to handle even the most basic and necessary expenses. these elements collectively paint a picture of an individual grappling with significant stress due to financial pressures and the resultant uncertainty about their future."
"I've been with my girlfriend since I was I was 16, and there are no real problems. For the past few months, I don't find myself enjoying being around her anymore, enjoy talking to her, or wanting to do anything ""special"" in general like I used to. I'm not interested in anybody else by any means. She has helped me with a lot, would do anything or me, and has never done anything to hurt me or cheated. She's the best partner you could ask for, but even still when she talks I don't want to listen.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing a change in feelings towards their partner but does not exhibit clear signs of stress. the individual acknowledges the positive aspects of the relationship and the partner's supportive nature. the lack of enjoyment and interest could be indicative of other emotional states such as boredom or detachment rather than stress. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or significant life stressors that typically accompany stress. the narrative's tone is more reflective and questioning rather than anxious or distressed, suggesting a state of contemplation rather than stress."
"One of my flatmates has started distancing herself from me and I don't know what to do. I've never experienced this before as I've never really had a friendship this close with someone before. We used to see each other multiple times a day, when we were both in the flat we used to spend loads of time in each other's rooms just chilling and chatting. But recently she's been spending more time with other people rather than me. Before today I don't think I saw her for about a week which is crazy considering how close we were and that we live under the same roof.",1,"the narrative reveals signs of distress and anxiety due to the sudden change in the behavior of the flatmate. the author describes a close friendship that has significantly altered, causing confusion and concern. the use of phrases like ""distancing herself,"" ""i do not know what to do,"" and ""crazy considering how close we were"" highlights feelings of uncertainty and emotional upheaval. the abrupt shift from frequent interaction to almost no contact can be particularly unsettling, leading to stress. the author's repeated emphasis on the change and their lack of experience with such a situation further indicates their struggle to cope with the emotional impact."
Laundry. Lots of it. With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket. Overturn it. Sit on the fucking thing.,1,"the narrative describes a scene of overwhelming laundry and a sense of being overwhelmed, as indicated by the use of strong language and physical actions. the act of overturning the laundry basket and sitting on it suggests a moment of frustration and defeat. this kind of behavior, combined with the explicit expression of exasperation, is often associated with stress. the individual's physical posture, with their back against the door, implies a need to brace themselves, which can be a physical manifestation of feeling cornered or pressured. these elements collectively point towards the person experiencing significant stress."
All I can do is think about how bad finals are going to be. I hate it so much. I'm going to be so tired. I'm going to fail. My grades are so low I have to do great to keep them above passing.,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, particularly academic stress. the writer expresses a preoccupation with upcoming finals, which is a common source of anxiety for students. phrases like ""i hate it so much"" and ""i am going to be so tired"" reflect a sense of dread and anticipated exhaustion, both emotional and physical. the fear of failure is explicitly stated with ""i am going to fail,"" highlighting a significant concern about performance. the mention of low grades and the pressure to keep them above passing further emphasizes the stress related to academic achievement. these elements collectively suggest a high level of distress and worry, which are typical indicators of stress in individuals facing demanding situations like exams."
"But we didn't talk about it the morning after, and life went on. Over the next year, we would continue to stay up late at house parties or whatever the occasion was (until 3, 4, 5 AM) about once a month, and just talk and talk and talk, until we inevitably hooked up. Keep in mind he was still dating someone else. Eventually during one of these moments, I worked up the courage to indirectly get a pulse on his feelings. More or less, he said he thinks about me multiple times a day, which was different from anyone else he ""dated"" prior.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author engages in recurring late-night conversations and encounters with someone who is already in a relationship. despite the potentially complicated nature of these interactions, the tone of the narrative suggests a sense of acceptance and normalcy. the author recounts the events in a straightforward manner, without expressing significant emotional turmoil or distress. the mention of ""life went on"" and the continuation of their interactions over a year indicates a level of stability and routine. furthermore, the author describes a moment of courage in seeking clarity about the other person's feelings, which resulted in a positive affirmation. this lack of emotional upheaval or anxiety, along with the ability to approach the situation with curiosity rather than stress, suggests an overall sense of calm and acceptance. these aspects are typical indicators of a non-stressful narrative."
"I didn't want any of this.. I literally had NO CHOICE in ANY of this!!! If I didn't have kids I would not be here, 100%. I pray every night that I would just die in my sleep... then LOL no sleep, no death, just lots of screaming in my head and ruminating anxious thoughts, bad memories on top of bad memories. THIS is hell.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, such as feelings of helplessness and a lack of control over one's circumstances, evident in the phrases ""i did not want any of this"" and ""i literally had no choice."" the mention of praying to die in sleep and the subsequent frustration with the lack of sleep highlights a deep sense of despair and emotional exhaustion. the description of ""screaming in my head and ruminating anxious thoughts"" points to intrusive, persistent anxiety, while ""bad memories on top of bad memories"" suggests an overwhelming burden of negative experiences. these elements collectively depict a state of acute mental distress, aligning with common symptoms of severe stress and potentially depression."
"I was walking to a class when someone behind me at their locker dropped their stuff. I went into a panic and I started reliving the trauma. After it went away, I told my friends about it outside of class. In response, they started jokingly throwing things at the ground (including some of my stuff). I started crying in the middle of class, but no one noticed.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual experiences a sudden and intense reaction to a relatively minor event, which is indicative of stress, particularly stress related to trauma. the panic and reliving of trauma when someone drops their belongings suggests a heightened state of anxiety and hypervigilance, common in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the individual's response to their friends' insensitive actions—crying in class and feeling unnoticed—further reflects feelings of isolation, helplessness, and emotional overwhelm. these reactions are consistent with high stress levels and difficulty managing emotional responses, especially in social settings. the lack of support or understanding from peers exacerbates the individual's stress, contributing to a sense of alienation and emotional distress."
"This means I also found it never quit heroine, but it was doing drugs behind my back. I even asked one time if it still did drugs and it lied to my face. However, it also had the audacity to question my loyalty and asked if i was hanging out with it to entertain my friends. What kind of time do you think I have... Figured out it was a covert narc abuser down to a T.",0,"the narrative details experiences with deceit and betrayal, which can be emotionally taxing, but it is recounted with a tone of resolution and understanding. the individual describes uncovering the truth about someone else's drug use and manipulative behavior. despite the negative experiences, the person seems to have a clear grasp of the situation and is able to articulate their thoughts without evident signs of overwhelming distress. the use of phrases like ""figured out"" and ""down to a t"" suggests a sense of control and closure rather than ongoing stress. these aspects indicate that while the experiences described are serious, the individual has processed them in a way that does not currently reflect significant stress."
"I asked him how he's doing to fund this, if there are any bursaries and if so, how much these are, but he never gives a clear answer. --- **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is unemployed, looking for 'perfect' job until he starts his Medicine degree, unsure how he will fund this degree. I resent him for poor financial judgement and day-time chilling. How to change this?",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators such as uncertainty, resentment, and frustration. the individual is concerned about their boyfriend's financial stability and his lack of clear planning, which contributes to feelings of insecurity about the future. the mention of ""resentment for poor financial judgement and day-time chilling"" highlights an emotional burden and dissatisfaction with the boyfriend's current behavior. this resentment can stem from the pressure of having to potentially support or deal with the consequences of his lack of financial planning. the stress is further compounded by the uncertainty about how he will fund his medicine degree, which is a significant and potentially expensive commitment. the narrative shows a clear struggle with managing expectations and the anxiety that comes from an unclear financial future, both of which are strong indicators of stress."
"Edit 1: No car also. She doesn't have a job. Again, should she get a job after the baby is born? Or will she be better off leeching from the government? It may be selfish, but I am not against being a leech and getting every penny in assistance I can, until I am able to do otherwise.",0,"the narrative reflects a pragmatic and somewhat detached consideration of options regarding employment and government assistance. there is a focus on practical decisions and a lack of emotional distress or urgency, which are often indicators of stress. the author is weighing the pros and cons of getting a job versus relying on government aid, and although there is a mention of selfishness, it is presented in a rational and calculated manner rather than an emotional one. this kind of logical analysis and absence of overwhelming emotional language suggests a non-stressed state of mind. the narrative does not exhibit signs of anxiety, panic, or other stress-related symptoms, but rather a clear-headed evaluation of circumstances."
"I'm new to this so please forgive me. I'm not very good at expressing my emotions. I need advice/help. I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old). After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of significant stress and trauma. the individual mentions a history of being molested by their biological father over several years, which is a profound and distressing experience. the repeated victimization from a trusted family member can lead to severe psychological distress, including feelings of betrayal, confusion, and helplessness. the difficulty in expressing emotions and seeking advice or help further suggests an internal struggle and a possible sense of isolation or fear of not being understood. additionally, the mother's negative reaction to the individual's attempts to disclose the abuse adds another layer of stress, likely exacerbating feelings of abandonment and invalidation. these aspects collectively highlight a deeply stressful and traumatic context, characterized by significant emotional turmoil and a lack of supportive responses from a key family member."
Went to my first survivors of incest mtg yesterday. Sexually abused between 4/5-8/9. Have been crying for the last 3 hours and can’t think of anything else except how lonely and how much of a failure I’ve become. I’ve been in therapy since 19 but hadn’t disclosed to ANYONE about the sexual abuse by my two brothers. Then I was forced to disclose to my therapist the truth about the abuse when one of the brothers reached out to me one random day saying he wanted to perform sexual acts on me.,1,"the narrative describes an individual who attended a support meeting for survivors of incest, indicating a traumatic past involving sexual abuse between the ages of 4/5 and 8/9. the person has been crying for hours and feels overwhelmed by loneliness and a sense of failure, which are strong emotional responses often associated with stress. the mention of ongoing therapy since the age of 19 highlights a long-term struggle with mental health issues, compounded by the recent, distressing disclosure of abuse to their therapist after a triggering event involving one of the abusers. these elements suggest significant psychological distress, as the individual is grappling with unresolved trauma, intense emotional reactions, and a profound sense of isolation and inadequacy."
Since over the summer he has became homeless and gotten into drugs. He was living in his car and I was jogging one evening he approached me and he confronted me. I was so scared I kind of just stood there and he was insulting me and calling me every name in the book. He tried to get me to use my phone so he can call my mom and I denied his request. He said that if I don't let him use my phone he's going to stab.,1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing encounter involving threats of violence and coercion, which are clear indicators of a stressful situation. the individual recounts a traumatic event where they were approached by someone who had recently become homeless and involved in drugs. the confrontation included verbal abuse and intimidation, with the aggressor making direct threats to harm the narrator if they did not comply with his demands. the fear and helplessness experienced by the narrator are evident, as they describe being so scared that they were unable to move. this level of fear and the immediate threat to personal safety are significant markers of acute stress. additionally, the context of encountering someone in a desperate and unstable state further exacerbates the stressfulness of the situation. the narrative reflects a scenario that would likely cause significant psychological distress, anxiety, and fear, which are all typical indicators of stress."
"Hi this is my first post here. I have complex PTSD which I have only just been diagnosed with, prior to this they diagnosed me with borderline personality disorders and bipolar which are now not correct. I believe this diagnosis is finally correct and a month ago I decided to reduce my sertraline medication as i am paying for therapy and my medication will effect my treatment.

My therapy involves a lot of therapy, mindfulness, meditation and we will be beginning emdr shortly.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently received a diagnosis of complex ptsd after previously being misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. the person is proactive in their treatment, choosing to reduce their sertraline medication to enhance the effectiveness of their therapy. they are engaged in a comprehensive therapeutic approach that includes mindfulness, meditation, and are about to start emdr. while the narrative mentions serious mental health conditions, the tone is pragmatic and hopeful, reflecting a structured and thoughtful approach to managing their condition. the individual seems to have a clear plan and support system in place, which are not typical indicators of someone currently experiencing high levels of stress. instead, these elements suggest a level of control and optimism about their mental health journey."
"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first. In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before. Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met. She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)). I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of past tension and emotional upheaval, but it does not exhibit the ongoing distress or immediate stress typically associated with current stress indicators. the individual recounts a difficult revelation and the subsequent emotional impact, such as feeling crushed upon learning about their partner's previous marriage and the abuse she endured. however, the focus is on past events and the emotions tied to them rather than on present, overwhelming stress. the language used, while reflective and somewhat somber, lacks the urgency, anxiety, or preoccupation with current problems that often characterize narratives from individuals experiencing significant stress. the person seems to be processing and reflecting on past experiences rather than being consumed by present stressors."
"Whats the chances of his employer asking for his certificate randomly? I feel like he cant apply to other jobs at more prestigious companies. As someone who who tried very hard to get her degree and succeeded, his lack of care and access to these jobs undermines my work. I cant shake this feeling. Advice?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and concern, but it does not exhibit classic indicators of stress. the individual expresses dissatisfaction with someone else's perceived lack of effort compared to their own, and there is a hint of jealousy regarding job opportunities. however, the language used does not convey overwhelming anxiety or distress. instead, it suggests a rational inquiry about the likelihood of an employer's actions and a personal reflection on the fairness of the situation. while the person feels undermined, this emotion is articulated in a controlled and composed manner, lacking the urgency or emotional intensity typically associated with stress. the request for advice also indicates a proactive approach to resolving their feelings, rather than being overwhelmed by them."
Eventually crazyass went flat out nuts and kicked both me and it boy out. We were now homeless. And we started hanging out with a friend of mine who was also in that situation. We'll call this guy Wolf. Wolf had a thing for this girl named S. S was one of those types who cheated on her boyfriend constantly.,0,"the narrative describes a series of unfortunate events and challenging circumstances, such as being kicked out and becoming homeless. however, the tone and language used in the narrative do not convey a significant level of distress or emotional turmoil typically associated with stress. instead, the description appears more factual and detached, focusing on the sequence of events and the behaviors of the individuals involved. the use of nicknames and casual references, such as ""crazyass"" and ""it boy,"" along with the matter-of-fact mention of ""wolf"" and ""s,"" suggests a level of detachment or normalization of these events rather than an emotional response indicative of stress. this lack of emotional intensity and the more narrative-driven recounting of events are not typical indicators of a stressed state."
"You will be to, you may be 2 years, 5 years, maybe even longer, from escaping it, but please, just trust me. It can and will get better. You'll get out of it Don't lose sight of the potentially massive amount of time you'll get in happiness and meaning compared to the few years you'll spend in this nightmare. Feel free to dm me if anyone wants to talk. (the reason this is posted on an alt account is by the off chance it gains any traction, I do not want this out for family to potentially see until I've left here.)",0,"the narrative exhibits a tone of reassurance and optimism, encouraging others to hold on and have faith that their situation will improve over time. the writer emphasizes the temporary nature of current struggles and the promise of future happiness and meaning. this perspective suggests a focus on hope and resilience rather than immediate distress. the offer to provide support through direct messages indicates a willingness to help others, a trait that is often less pronounced in individuals who are currently overwhelmed by stress. the use of an alternate account to maintain privacy shows a level of foresight and precaution, which can be interpreted as a sign of thoughtful consideration rather than impulsive behavior typically associated with high stress. overall, the narrative reflects a balanced and forward-looking mindset, indicative of someone who is managing their stress well and is in a position to offer support to others."
"Hey all! I'm in San Diego CA and about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with lupus nephritis. I haven't had the most stable care and have had to move all over the country just to maintain safety. Most recently, my mother who I have a very rough (to say the least) relationship with said she would help take care of me financially as I cannot work right now. Well for some reason this last month my mom just stopped paying my rent which led to eviction.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators. the individual mentions being diagnosed with lupus nephritis, a chronic illness that inherently carries physical and emotional stress. the instability in medical care and the need to move frequently for safety reasons further compounds this stress, as it disrupts routine and support systems. the strained relationship with their mother, who initially offered financial support but then ceased without explanation, adds another layer of emotional turmoil. the sudden cessation of financial aid leading to eviction introduces acute stress, as housing insecurity is a major stressor. these elements collectively depict a scenario filled with uncertainty, instability, and significant emotional and physical burdens, all of which are classic indicators of high stress."

I always have anxiety and sadness.,1,"the narrative exhibits clear indicators of stress through the expression of intense dread and fear related to work. the individual mentions a pattern of anxiety and sadness, which are common symptoms of stress. the mention of contemplating suicide about a week ago is a significant red flag, indicating severe distress and potential risk. these elements collectively suggest a high level of psychological strain, as the individual is experiencing chronic anxiety and depressive symptoms, which are critical markers of stress. the recurring nature of these feelings, especially tied to specific days and events, further underscores the ongoing and pervasive nature of their stress."
"Hi. So, my husband is emotionally and mentally abusive. I've tried to leave several times but he threatens to kill himself if I do, by crashing his car or running into traffic. However, I have nowhere to go even if I do. My family dosent want/can't afford to have me live with them again.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing significant emotional and psychological distress. key indicators of stress include the mention of an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship, which inherently contributes to high levels of anxiety and fear. the repeated attempts to leave the abusive environment, coupled with the husband's threats of self-harm, create a sense of entrapment and helplessness. the lack of a supportive network, as indicated by the family’s inability to accommodate or assist, exacerbates feelings of isolation and desperation. these elements collectively suggest a high-stress situation, characterized by emotional turmoil, fear for safety, and a perceived lack of viable escape routes or support systems."
"I have Bipolar 1 disorder and CPTSD. I literally overwhelm LCSWs and MFts with my symptoms. They have no idea where to begin - because it isn't their expertise - they are generalists!

I could do DBT, EMDR, or Somatic Experiencing.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress indicators, particularly in the context of managing complex mental health conditions like bipolar 1 disorder and cptsd. the individual describes feeling overwhelmed and expresses frustration with the inadequacy of the support they receive from generalist mental health professionals, such as lcsws and mfts. the mention of specific therapeutic modalities like dbt, emdr, and somatic experiencing highlights their awareness and desire for specialized treatment, which suggests a sense of urgency and distress over not receiving appropriate care. the language used conveys a sense of being misunderstood and unsupported, which are common emotional experiences for individuals under stress. the narrative also underscores the difficulty in navigating the mental health system, further contributing to their stress. overall, the detailed account of their symptoms and the perceived lack of specialized care are clear indicators of the stress they are experiencing."

When my answers did not satisfy her, she called the belly dancer over and told her to dance with me. I froze up briefly then just fucking left the restaurant.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is put under social pressure by their mother in a public setting. the insistence and pushing from the mother, despite the individual's clear discomfort and refusal, indicate a lack of respect for boundaries, which can be a significant stressor. the use of strong language such as ""for whatever fucking reason"" and ""just fucking left"" reflects heightened emotional arousal and frustration. freezing up and ultimately leaving the restaurant are indicative of a stress response, as the individual felt overwhelmed and chose to remove themselves from the situation. the context of being forced into an unwanted interaction, especially in front of others, is a common trigger for stress. these elements collectively suggest that the individual was experiencing significant stress during this event."
"The weird feeling hasn't gone away; but I feel slightly better because I can donate stuff to a kid (completely unknown to me); his family is having financial struggles.

"This was literally the first meal I've had with other people in nearly a year. This couple was young enough to be my children and I could picture myself in their situation which I pray will never happen, but if it does I would really hope someone would buy me some food every once in a while. The guy seemed a bit sheepish, but the woman seemed a bit more comfortable with being homeless.

But I thought they were homeless!?!",0,"the narrative reflects an individual recounting an experience of sharing a meal with a young homeless couple. the individual describes their thoughts and observations during the meal, expressing empathy and a desire to help others in similar situations. the narrative includes reflections on the couple's demeanor, with the man appearing sheepish and the woman more comfortable with their circumstances. despite some confusion about the woman's comment regarding getting home by midnight, the overall tone is one of curiosity and compassion rather than distress. there is no indication of significant emotional turmoil or anxiety that would suggest the author is experiencing stress. instead, the narrative focuses on the experience itself and the author's empathetic response to the couple's situation."
am a married 26 yo father of one. About two years ago I left my job to start a business with a childhood friend of mine and his brother. It ended horribly with them taking out the funds for the company from a joint account and leaving me penniless. As a result I moved with my family into my mother's home to get back on my feet. My relationship with her has never been good but it was the only option at the time so I ground my teeth and did the best to make it work.,0,"the narrative describes a series of significant life changes and challenges, such as leaving a job to start a business that failed, resulting in financial loss and the need to move in with a family member with whom the relationship is strained. despite these events, the narrative's tone and wording suggest a level-headed approach to the situation. phrases like ""get back on my feet"" and ""did the best to make it work"" indicate resilience and an active effort to manage the circumstances rather than being overwhelmed by them. the mention of ""ground my teeth"" suggests determination rather than despair. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is handling the situation without exhibiting signs of being overwhelmed by stress."
"My mom [54F] has catered to his every need since marriage, and although she complains about it constantly, she still goes along with it. Although he uses his anger to attempt to show others ""he's the boss"" and can order them around, I believe he's a weak coward inside who loses all control when he becomes afraid or upset (I'll provide examples below). There are some events concerning him that have occurred throughout my life that have caused me to come to resent him (and my mom too sort of): From as far back as I can remember, to this day (although it's much less now), my parents have had screaming matches. My dad's face turning red and spit flying, as he yells and often curses at the top of his lungs to my mom, and her crying and screaming back.",0,"the narrative describes a family dynamic characterized by ongoing conflict and emotional turmoil, particularly focusing on the relationship between the narrator's parents. the mother is portrayed as someone who consistently meets the father's demands despite her frequent complaints, indicating a possible pattern of codependency or learned helplessness. the father's behavior is depicted as domineering and aggressive, using anger as a tool to assert control, which suggests underlying insecurities and possibly unresolved emotional issues. the vivid recollection of screaming matches, with details like the father's red face and spitting, underscores the intensity of these conflicts. while these descriptions highlight significant familial stressors, the narrative itself does not provide direct evidence of the narrator experiencing personal stress at the moment of writing. instead, it appears to be a reflective account of past events, suggesting that the narrator might have reached a point of detachment or resolution regarding these experiences. the lack of immediate, personal stress indicators such as present-tense descriptions of anxiety, tension, or emotional distress suggests that the narrator is recounting rather than reliving these stressful experiences."
She has $40 dollars in her pocket. She did graduate from high school. She has stayed with different friends for the last year but has used up her welcome. She has no where else to turn. What is her best possible move to do in this situation?,0,"the narrative describes a person who has limited financial resources, a high school education, and a history of staying with friends. while these factors might suggest potential stressors, the narrative lacks specific indicators of acute stress. there are no mentions of overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or cognitive impairments typically associated with stress. the tone appears more problem-solving and reflective, focusing on assessing the situation and considering options rather than expressing distress or anxiety. this suggests that the individual may be facing challenges but is not necessarily experiencing significant stress."
"He turns it on first thing in the morning and turns it on the moment he gets home from work at night to play until midnight or later. Any free moment he has is spent playing this game. I'm a stay at home mom so I really look forward to talking to him, he's usually the only adult I talk to face to face during the week. Plus I love talking with him and spending time with him anyways, that's why I married him! Back when this all started, I told him that I needed him to spend more time with his kids and I.",1,"the narrative reveals significant signs of distress and emotional strain. the individual describes a situation where their partner is heavily engaged in gaming, which takes up most of his free time. this behavior leads to feelings of neglect and isolation for the narrator, who is a stay-at-home mom and relies on her partner for adult interaction and emotional support. the repeated attempts to communicate the need for more family time highlight a sense of unmet needs and frustration. the emotional impact is evident in the longing for connection and the disappointment that their requests for change have not been addressed. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as the narrator experiences a lack of support and companionship, which are crucial for mental well-being."
"He didn't talk to me for a few days, and told me he needed some space. He ended up talking to her and it worked out because she actually got a raise in the city that we're both from, and her manager begged her to stay and work there. He decided he didn't want to be mad and brought me coffee this morning and talked about it with me. I told him that he could date this girl when we broke up, and I couldn't control that but I don't like them living together so soon after we break up. He told me that after a year and a half one fight isn't so bad.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where there are elements of interpersonal conflict and resolution. the individual recounts a period of not communicating with their partner, who needed space, and how this led to a discussion about the partner's interactions with another person. despite the potential for stress in such a situation, the narrative includes indicators of resolution and a level-headed approach to the issues at hand. the mention of bringing coffee and having a constructive conversation suggests an ability to manage emotions and maintain a calm demeanor. the reference to a single fight over a significant period indicates a perspective that downplays the conflict's severity, emphasizing the overall stability of the relationship. these aspects collectively suggest that the individual is not overwhelmed by stress but rather is handling the situation with a balanced and composed mindset."
as a result hes put his hands on me. He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over. he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it. I honestly dont know if its true. Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing physical aggression and emotional manipulation. phrases like ""hes put his hands on me"" and ""he tells me its my fault"" indicate a hostile and abusive environment. the repeated attempts to seek amicability and the self-doubt expressed in ""i honestly dont know if its true"" suggest significant emotional turmoil and confusion. the context of seeking peace but facing blame and aggression are clear indicators of stress, as the individual is caught in a cycle of conflict and self-questioning. these elements are typical markers of stress due to the ongoing tension, fear, and uncertainty about one's own perceptions and actions."
"Except now, the boyfriend's taken up drinking as he did before and has fallen back into his verbal and physically abusive habits. I'm not willing to take this anymore and I honestly fear for my safety when he has these psychotic mood swings. I have nowhere to go, though. No family or friends in this area and honestly, the area my family does live in was a ""living with druggies"" situation I do not want to be forced back into. I don't know what to do.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing significant emotional and physical distress. the boyfriend's return to drinking and abusive behavior is a clear source of ongoing stress and fear for the narrator. the mention of fearing for personal safety during the boyfriend's mood swings indicates a high level of anxiety and concern for immediate physical harm. the lack of support systems, such as family or friends nearby, exacerbates the feeling of isolation and helplessness. additionally, the reluctance to return to a previous living situation with drug addicts highlights a sense of being trapped with no viable escape options. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress and a desperate need for a solution to a perilous living environment."
"She went through a very rough patch about a year ago and her mental health was clearly affected, she was living out of her car, she had left an abusive bf and then she had a crash in her car. For some reason she decided to go to Romania for treatment. I only heard from her sporadically. Once she called me and let slip that she had been raped as well as hit, drugged, something about a court case, and whay sounded to me like a lot of paranoia about mafia and government. I put this down to ptsd from her abuse.",0,"the narrative describes a series of traumatic events and severe hardships experienced by the individual, including homelessness, abuse, a car accident, and a possible court case. the mention of sporadic communication and the disclosure of being raped, hit, and drugged, along with fears of mafia and government involvement, indicates a high level of distress. these details suggest that the person has been through significant trauma, potentially leading to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). however, the classification suggests that despite these severe experiences, the narrative does not reflect current stress in the author. this might imply that the author is recounting past events with a degree of detachment or that the author is not the individual who experienced these events directly, but rather someone who is describing another person's situation. the use of clinical terms and a relatively objective tone in recounting the incidents may also indicate a level of emotional distance, which could explain the classification."
"I feel like I just keep digging a hole for myself, and its my fault I'm in there. With work I get emails about updates to projects and I usually these days don't reply, and submit what I have worked on minutes prior to my meetings. Which always results in a pissed off boss really. Then I feel even worse and my ocd comes back telling me that I'm a horrible person and everyone hates me. Its a weird tick, I don't know how to describe it.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of someone experiencing stress. the author expresses a sense of self-blame and frustration, feeling as though they are continually making their situation worse. the mention of work-related stress, specifically the avoidance of emails and last-minute submissions, highlights a common stressor in professional environments. the reaction of their boss and the subsequent feelings of guilt further compound their stress. additionally, the return of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) symptoms, characterized by intrusive thoughts of being a horrible person and feeling hated, underscores the psychological impact of their stress. the author's acknowledgment of a ""weird tick"" suggests an awareness of their own mental health struggles, which is often a sign of internalized stress. overall, these elements collectively indicate a high level of stress experienced by the individual."
"Over the past 6 years I've settled into a career that I'm really good at. Unfortunately I've had a slew of bosses that I had trouble dealing with. One of my biggest issues is that I'm prone to making small mistakes. They're not catastrophic, but they happen more often than I'd like. I've had supervisors that get really annoyed over these small mistakes, and they make me feel like my job is on the line.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual has a stable career, but the recurring issue of making small mistakes has led to significant stress. the person mentions difficulty dealing with multiple bosses over the years, indicating a pattern of strained relationships at work. the frequent small mistakes, while not catastrophic, are a source of anxiety, particularly because they elicit strong negative reactions from supervisors. the fear of job security being threatened adds to the overall stress. these elements—repeated mistakes, negative feedback from authority figures, and fear of job loss—are classic indicators of stress in a professional setting. the cumulative effect of these stressors over an extended period has likely contributed to a heightened state of anxiety and stress for the individual."
It was a bit cringe because she was acting just too over the top. But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character. However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in. It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ) I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author felt uncomfortable due to someone else's behavior, which was perceived as over the top and inappropriate. the author recalls specific statements that were unsettling, such as references to cuddling and netflix and chill, which contributed to their discomfort. however, the tone of the narrative suggests a reflective recounting rather than an emotionally charged or stressed response. the author's ability to provide specific details, the use of humor (e.g., ""giving him a confused wtf look""), and the overall casual tone indicate a lack of significant emotional distress. these aspects suggest that while the situation was awkward, it did not elicit a stress response from the author."
"My sister told me yesterday that my dad violently abused her as a child. She also said that my dad was about to punch me in me the face when I was 10 years old (and she was 14) and she rescued me. My mum, stood by and did nothing, for some reason. I don't remember. My sister was an angry kid and she said her experiences sent her into a depression for about ten years.",0,"the narrative describes a traumatic family history involving abuse and neglect, but the focus is more on recounting past events rather than expressing current emotional distress. the individual recounts their sister's experiences and emotions, such as anger and depression, but does not convey their own feelings or reactions in the present moment. the lack of immediate emotional language or indications of ongoing distress, such as anxiety, sadness, or overwhelming thoughts, suggests a more detached recounting of events rather than an expression of personal stress. while the content is undeniably heavy, the narrative's tone and focus on past events rather than present emotional impact are key indicators that the individual may not be currently experiencing significant stress."
"So I've recently started having anxiety attacks where it becomes hard to breathe, with the subject regarding many topics, mainly obsessing about relationships and government bureaucracies that I have to handle lately, and mainly where my life is going.

My spouse and I live in a war-torn country full of people trying to rip you off any chance they get, everyone is rude and generally don't fit the way I've been brought up, everything is expensive and the stress is beyond measure here. Not how we were brought up. We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes experiencing anxiety attacks, which are a common physiological response to stress. the difficulty in breathing during these attacks is a physical symptom that often accompanies high levels of anxiety. the obsessive thoughts about relationships and bureaucratic challenges suggest a preoccupation with stressors that exacerbate their mental state. feelings of being lost and uncertainty about life direction further indicate psychological distress. living in a war-torn country with pervasive rudeness, financial strain, and a general environment that conflicts with their upbringing adds to the chronic stress. the anticipation of a future move to a more stable environment indicates a desire to escape the current stressors, highlighting the severity of their current situation. these elements collectively paint a picture of significant stress affecting the individual's mental and physical well-being."
"Can you contribute your story alongside others who have been/ are going through recovery? I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own.

Maybe i could buy a gun and shoot myself idk .",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, starting with the urgency and desperation in the writer's situation. being given a deadline to find a place to live and failing to do so creates a significant pressure, especially when the deadline is imminent. the lack of a car and supportive friends exacerbates feelings of isolation and helplessness. the mention of having only 600 dollars highlights financial strain, adding another layer of stress. the contemplation of extreme actions, such as leaving the state or self-harm, signifies a high level of distress and hopelessness. these elements collectively suggest a severe emotional and psychological burden, characteristic of someone experiencing significant stress."
"I started noticing her internet behavior more over the past few months and it's been kind of bothering me. My girlfriend is a very intelligent and mature person, but when she gets online it's like she acts totally different. For one, she sends me screencaps of her ""trolling"" people. I mean, trolling? She's almost 30.",0,"the narrative reflects observations and mild concerns about the girlfriend's online behavior, but it lacks strong indicators of significant emotional distress or stress. the author describes their girlfriend as intelligent and mature, which suggests a generally positive view of her character. the specific behavior that bothers the author—trolling others online—is noted, but the tone is more of mild confusion or annoyance rather than anxiety or stress. the author seems perplexed by the discrepancy between her offline and online personas but does not express feelings of overwhelm, helplessness, or emotional strain. the focus remains on the girlfriend's actions rather than the author's emotional response, indicating a state of curiosity or mild irritation rather than stress."

During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like bone tb or stomach gastritis.

I think the hiring manager figured out I was homeless when she asked about dependable transportation and my place of residence, I've never had an interview where they ask ""and you have a place to live?"" That was the only question I stumbled on, so that might have given an inclination that I am homeless.",0,"the narrative conveys a sense of relief and positive outcome following a job interview, which suggests a lack of significant stress. the initial wish for luck is a common expression and does not inherently indicate stress. the subsequent update about securing the job and receiving a higher salary than expected highlights a moment of success and satisfaction. although there is a mention of homelessness, the context in which it is presented does not evoke distress but rather a factual recount of the interview process. the individual reflects on the hiring manager's possible awareness of their situation with a tone that appears more observational than anxious. overall, the narrative lacks signs of emotional turmoil or overwhelming concern, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it focuses on the positive outcome and the practical aspects of the interview experience."

"I do not want to hurt anybody. The therapist says it is self punishment, that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe.

If it is unconscious, well I am getting sick of that idea.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as self-deprecating thoughts and emotional turmoil. the individual expresses a desire to avoid causing harm to others, which may stem from an internalized sense of guilt or self-blame. the mention of the therapist's interpretation that the individual seeks validation for negative self-beliefs suggests a deep-seated issue with self-worth. the fluctuating emotional responses to others' reactions—feeling better when treated kindly and worse when treated coldly—highlight an unstable emotional state often associated with stress. the frustration with the idea of unconscious motivations indicates a struggle with self-awareness and control over one's feelings, further emphasizing the presence of stress. overall, the narrative encapsulates a complex interplay of negative self-perception, emotional sensitivity, and frustration, all of which are common indicators of stress."
"To make a long story short I suffer from anxiety, depression and PTSD due to past abuse since I was pretty young and recently had to move back home due to a traumatic event/mental health making it hard for me to survive on my own. This has made it very hard for me to be able to work/make money and support myself so my mother (being the kind woman she is) has helped out in feeding me but we're both low on food now and I feel horribly guilty and responsible.

If anyone can help out in ANY way I will really appreciate it.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through the mention of anxiety, depression, and ptsd, all of which are serious mental health conditions often exacerbated by stress. the individual describes a history of past abuse, which can contribute to chronic stress and trauma responses. the recent move back home due to a traumatic event and mental health challenges further underscores their current state of distress. the inability to work and support themselves, coupled with the financial strain on both the individual and their mother, adds layers of economic stress and guilt. the feelings of desperation and the proactive steps they are taking to seek assistance also highlight the urgency and pressure they are experiencing. overall, the narrative is laden with multiple stressors, both psychological and situational, which are typical indicators of a high-stress state."
"Obviously this was a horrible idea--I would chase off perfectly lovely people who may have stayed had I waited to disclose at a more natural pace, and it gave the people who *did* hang around a false sense that they knew me more intimately than they did.

I've mentioned very vaguely that I live with PTSD and ""blah blah childhood trauma, et cetera"". This weekend was a tough one.",0,"the narrative reflects a mix of self-awareness and cautious optimism. the author acknowledges past mistakes in their approach to disclosing personal information, suggesting a reflective and thoughtful mindset. while there is a mention of ptsd and childhood trauma, these are presented in a casual, almost dismissive manner, indicating a level of comfort or acceptance rather than acute distress. the excitement about a new relationship and the balanced way of handling personal disclosures suggest an individual who is navigating their experiences with a sense of control and hope. the mention of a tough weekend is brief and lacks detail, implying it did not significantly disrupt their overall positive outlook. these elements collectively point to a person who, despite having a history of trauma, is currently managing well and not overwhelmed by stress."

"Even if people experience mental health differently, this reeks of toxic character. He is convinced he needs to stick around, avoid change, see this through, that eventually she’ll “go back to how she was before” (whatever that means) and that he’ll keep trying to make it work. The typical “I can fix this” response that colours victims of abusive partners - and having been one, it is especially demoralizing to see him having to go through this for the sake of avoiding both change and a failed marriage. What can I do to help him, besides support him emotionally, and eventually have him realize for himself that this is not normal? tl;dr: my [25F] partner [30M] is being abused by his wife [28F], but is convinced to keep trying to make it work despite the situation detrimentally affecting his own mental health.",0,"the narrative describes a person observing a friend's toxic relationship and expressing concern about their well-being. while there is empathy and a desire to help, the tone is reflective and problem-solving rather than distressed. the writer acknowledges the complexity of mental health experiences and the difficulty of the situation, but they focus on potential solutions and support strategies rather than expressing personal anxiety or overwhelm. this indicates a level-headed approach to the situation, suggesting the writer is not personally experiencing significant stress but is instead focused on providing support and understanding to their friend."

"As we put mud on ourselves and some kids having fear in their eyes, the admins then coax a volunteer to get on his knees and pray to the “dead” adults covered in the tarp. He was adamant at first, but then the kid broke down crying. He cried about his dead mother. How he regretted not loving her enough. All of the other kids didn’t know whether to cry with him or look on in horror at the situation.",0,"the narrative describes a distressing and emotionally charged situation involving children, mud, and a volunteer being coerced into a symbolic act of mourning. while the content is intense and evocative, the label suggests that the individual recounting the event is not experiencing personal stress. this could indicate that the narrator is detached or observing the situation from a neutral or professional standpoint. the focus on detailed descriptions of others' reactions, such as the fear in the children's eyes and the volunteer's breakdown, without expressing personal emotional turmoil, suggests an observational rather than participatory perspective. the narrative lacks first-person emotional expressions or signs of personal distress, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it reads more like a recounting of events with an emphasis on external behaviors and reactions."
"The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months. She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together. The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month. That's not insignificant. The thing is I probably *could* be ready for that step if I had to, I'm just not really for or against it.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful consideration of a potential change in living arrangements with a girlfriend of nine months. the individual weighs the pros and cons of moving in together, noting the financial benefit of saving $5-600 a month and the generally positive relationship dynamics. the tone of the narrative is balanced and measured, with no evident signs of anxiety or urgency. the individual expresses a neutral stance, indicating they could be ready for the step if necessary but are not feeling pressured or particularly inclined either way. this balanced, rational approach to decision-making and the absence of emotional distress or conflict are indicative of a non-stressed state."
And I'll get an intense feeling of impending doom. It lasts for less than a minute and then I'll fall back asleep. It usually happens during naps. I thought it was a seizure when it first happened. Has this happened to anyone else?,1,"the narrative describes an intense feeling of impending doom that occurs suddenly and briefly, primarily during naps. this feeling is so overwhelming that the individual initially suspected it might be a seizure, indicating a high level of concern and confusion about their experience. the mention of ""impending doom"" is a classic symptom often associated with acute stress or anxiety attacks. the fact that this sensation disrupts their sleep, even if momentarily, suggests that it has a significant impact on their well-being. the individual's query about whether this has happened to others indicates a search for reassurance and validation, which is common among those experiencing stress, as they seek to understand and normalize their symptoms. these elements collectively point to a narrative consistent with stress-related experiences."
She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened. I don't know what to do. It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer. I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times. I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through expressions of uncertainty and anxiety. the individual is grappling with an impending situation that is causing them distress, evident from phrases like ""i do not know what to do"" and ""i am feeling a twinge of anxiety."" the mention of a decision regarding a restraining order or non-violent contact order suggests a serious and potentially threatening context, which can naturally lead to heightened stress levels. the self-reassurance attempts, such as ""i keep telling myself i did everything i possibly could,"" highlight an internal struggle to manage stress and maintain a sense of control. these elements collectively indicate the presence of stress, as the individual is dealing with complex emotions and significant decisions that impact their well-being."
"My husband and I live in an apartment that gets super cold easily. Part of that is because there's no protective trees in the winter, with the other problem being the buildings are run down, and there's lots of cracks around the door. My husband was able to fix a gaping crack with our door frame, but we still need more work done and management is not the best. Our heaters are old baseboard heaters that can heat the home, but run up our electricity bill like crazy. With the onset of early winter here in the midwest coupled with the loss of my husband's job, I'm going to go apply for LIHEAP, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of any other ways to keep the apartment warm.",0,"the narrative describes a series of practical challenges related to living conditions, such as a cold apartment, old heaters, and building maintenance issues. despite these issues, the tone remains focused on problem-solving and seeking solutions. the mention of applying for liheap and asking for additional ways to keep the apartment warm suggests a proactive approach to dealing with difficulties. while there is a mention of the husband's job loss, the overall narrative does not convey overwhelming distress or an inability to cope. instead, it reflects a pragmatic mindset, which is not typically indicative of high stress levels."
"I feel like one of my worst symptoms is nightmares. Not because they are overly terrifying, I don't wake up covered in sweat or out of breath. I just wake up feeling mentally and to a lesser degree physically exhausted. It just ruins my mood for the day and feels so hard to snap out of. I mostly just dream of killing my family and friends, or other random people, or people killing me or people dying.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of stress. the individual describes experiencing frequent nightmares, which is a common symptom associated with heightened stress levels. although the nightmares are not described as overly terrifying in a traditional sense, the mental and physical exhaustion they cause upon waking is significant. this persistent fatigue can greatly affect one's daily functioning and mood. the content of the nightmares is particularly distressing, involving themes of violence and death, which are often linked to underlying anxiety or unresolved trauma. the difficulty in shaking off the negative mood after these dreams further suggests an ongoing struggle with stress. overall, the narrative's depiction of chronic nightmares, mental exhaustion, and disturbing dream content points to a state of significant psychological stress."

"The verbal, emotions, and physical abuse continued I also believe in my heart that he cheated He left Facebook up on his computer with a conversation he had had with another ex about how much fun it was spending time with her(a day he had told me he was working late, couldn't even come up with an original lie)...it shattered me more, I didn't know my heart could break into any smaller pieces When she was three months old I told myself enough was enough... If he had shown even a glimmer of interest in his child or our marriage I could justify more time...but he didn't",1,"the narrative describes a deeply distressing situation involving continuous verbal, emotional, and physical abuse. the discovery of infidelity exacerbates the emotional turmoil, leading to a profound sense of betrayal and heartbreak. the mention of shattered trust and the realization of deceit illustrate a significant emotional burden. the narrator's decision to end the relationship highlights the culmination of accumulated stress and the recognition of a toxic environment. the lack of interest from the partner in both the child and the marriage further compounds feelings of abandonment and hopelessness. these elements are strong indicators of a high-stress experience, characterized by emotional pain, betrayal, and the struggle to find resolution amidst ongoing turmoil."

What can I do? --- **tl;dr**: Coworker who is supposed to show me the ropes is super grumpy and I find him intimidating, can I do anything about this?",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of anxiety and fear towards a coworker, which are common indicators of stress. the writer expresses a continuous fear of being criticized and micromanaged, which is evident in the phrase ""i feel like every second he is gonna stand behind me again and grunt at me."" this sense of being constantly watched and judged can create a stressful work environment. additionally, the uncertainty about the coworker possibly speaking negatively about them adds to the paranoia and stress, as seen in ""i do not know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when i am not there."" the use of the term ""super grumpy"" to describe the coworker indicates a negative interpersonal relationship, which can significantly contribute to workplace stress. the writer's question ""what can i do?"" and the plea for advice underline their feeling of helplessness and desperation, further highlighting the stress they are experiencing. overall, the narrative is characterized by feelings of intimidation, fear of criticism, and uncertainty, all of which are strong indicators of stress."
"An interesting fact I once heard was that some people die out in the desert with water still in the bottle. These people would try and conserve their water supply but would end up dehydrating themselves in the process, laughable over a few shots of whiskey but an important note at that. I drink nearly all I have and only saving a little to keep the mouth moist after a smoke and I find that by doing so I stay hydrated, never feeling like crap because the water hadn’t finished absorbing into my system. Remember that folks. When I finished watching the trains I found a place with a plug and wifi to jam out to music.",0,"the narrative presents a casual and somewhat light-hearted tone, discussing an interesting fact about survival in the desert and contrasting it with the author's personal habits. the mention of drinking whiskey and smoking indicates a relaxed, nonchalant attitude rather than one of stress. the author describes their hydration strategy in a practical manner and offers advice, suggesting a sense of control and lack of urgency or anxiety. the narrative ends on a positive note with the author finding a comfortable place to enjoy music, further indicating a state of leisure and contentment. overall, the narrative lacks the typical indicators of stress such as expressions of worry, frustration, or tension, and instead reflects a calm and composed mindset."
And he got angry at me. He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch.

I just can't do it anymore and I'm so depressed and I'm so scared that I will end up going back to him.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as the description of a conflict where the other person became angry and yelled, which can create a highly stressful environment. the writer's reaction of crying all day and expressing feelings of being unable to cope further highlights emotional distress. the mention of feeling depressed and scared about potentially returning to a harmful situation underscores a sense of helplessness and fear, common in stressed individuals. these emotional responses and the context of a tumultuous relationship are strong indicators of significant stress."
"Throwaway because this is an embarrassing issue (although everyone who knows me knows I have it). I’m sorry this is so long, I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and need to vent. I (21F) cry over the smallest things that I know I shouldn’t cry over. I have always been like this even since I was little. Whenever I get in an argument with someone, I cry and it eats away at me.",1,"the narrative reflects a person experiencing significant emotional distress, which is evident through several key indicators. the individual describes crying over minor issues and feeling embarrassed about this behavior, suggesting a heightened emotional sensitivity and a lack of control over their emotional responses. this persistent crying, even over small matters, is a common symptom of stress and can indicate underlying anxiety or emotional turmoil. the mention of arguments leading to crying and the feeling that these conflicts ""eat away"" at them further highlights a struggle with managing stress and emotional resilience. the person's sense of isolation and the need to vent also point to a lack of support systems, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of someone experiencing stress, such as emotional sensitivity, feelings of embarrassment, and a sense of being overwhelmed by conflicts."

"I'm a survivor of CSA and have been doing the work to process/cope with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This includes a few years of therapy & ~6 months on sertraline. Everyone in my family is pretty jumpy (I'm pretty sure we all have high anxiety), but lately I have become ridiculously easy to startle! The first time I noticed it being extremely bad was while at my boyfriend's and he was cooking steak. As occasionally happens, the smoke detector went off because of the steaks.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has a history of childhood sexual abuse and is actively working through depression, anxiety, and ptsd. they have engaged in therapy for several years and have been on sertraline for about six months. despite their progress, they mention an increase in their startle response, particularly noting an incident where a smoke detector went off while their boyfriend was cooking steak. while these experiences and symptoms are significant and suggest ongoing challenges, the individual is also taking proactive steps towards managing their mental health. their engagement in therapy and medication, as well as their awareness of family anxiety patterns, indicate a level of coping and self-awareness that might mitigate the acute stress indicators. thus, while the narrative includes elements of past trauma and anxiety, the individual's actions and insights suggest they are not currently in a state of overwhelming stress."
"My dad did this twice to her. He began harassing my brothers employees, telling them crazy stories that my brother was selling drugs, or that he raped someone, stories with I know are not true. We began hearing stories through the rumor mill that my dad was seen drunk driving in town on several occasions, and getting drunk in public. My dad broke into the house of a friend in town, the wife was downstairs and husband upstairs. She saw the look on my dads face when he barged through the front door (she said he looked crazy) and ran upstairs screaming.",0,"the narrative details a series of troubling events involving the narrator's father, including harassment, spreading false accusations, drunk driving, and breaking into a house. while these events are certainly distressing, the narrator's tone remains factual and detached, focusing on recounting the incidents rather than expressing personal emotional turmoil or anxiety. there is an absence of language indicating overwhelming stress or emotional breakdown, such as descriptions of physical symptoms, feelings of hopelessness, or intense worry. the narrator's ability to describe these events in a structured manner without delving into their own emotional state suggests they are coping with the situation without significant personal stress."

Pamela is disabled from complications and defects from when she was born; she has a brain shunt, and some cognitive issues. However, it's not enough to impair her too greatly obviously because she has worked in the call center I work at for about 12 years or so, and in other call centers before this.

And i cannot get rid of my cat because he is my ESA and the only thing keeping me sane at this point. What do i do when i feel like i don't have any other options. Even though this is my fault because i'm an idiot.,1,"the narrative reflects significant distress and a sense of helplessness, which are common indicators of stress. the individual describes a lack of access to essential services due to transportation issues, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and frustration. the mention of having no friends or family willing to help highlights a perceived lack of social support, a crucial factor in stress. the reliance on their emotional support animal (esa) underscores the depth of their emotional struggle, as they view the cat as their primary source of stability. the self-deprecating language, such as calling themselves an ""idiot,"" indicates low self-esteem and self-blame, both of which are psychological markers of stress. overall, the narrative paints a picture of someone feeling trapped and overwhelmed by their circumstances, with limited resources and support, leading to a heightened stress response."
"This has caused quite a few disagreements, as we often compromise for a ""quickie"" at some later time.

I love her dearly, and want to make this work, but I'm also worried that I shouldn't have gone this far into a relationship without a frame of reference for what I would want in one. She is my first girlfriend, but I'm afraid to throw away a relationship that's caused me to love someone so dearly. I've been cautious up to this point, but it does appear as though we have begun to get financially ""entangled"".",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is experiencing some relationship challenges and uncertainties, but it does not exhibit acute signs of stress. the person is aware of the disagreements and compromises in their relationship, acknowledging feelings of incompatibility and the impact of weight gain. however, the tone remains reflective rather than distressed. they express a deep affection for their partner and a desire to make the relationship work, indicating a thoughtful and measured approach to their situation. while there is some concern about their lack of relationship experience and the financial entanglement, the narrative lacks the urgency and heightened emotional response typically associated with stress. instead, it portrays a person contemplating their circumstances and seeking a path forward with care and consideration."
"I have so much stress over money on a daily basis that sometimes it’s nearly unbearable. As I mentioned, I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow, for which I am beyond grateful. But though they provide temporary relief, the loans themselves just end up being part of this vicious circle and mire me even deeper in the debt I’m trying to escape. I know more loans aren’t the answer. So I’m looking for a different kind of help.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects a significant level of stress, particularly related to financial concerns. the author explicitly mentions experiencing ""so much stress over money on a daily basis"" which indicates a persistent and pervasive worry. the phrase ""nearly unbearable"" suggests a high intensity of stress that is difficult to manage. the use of emergency assistance through loans, while providing temporary relief, ultimately contributes to a ""vicious circle"" of debt, exacerbating the individual's stress rather than alleviating it. this cyclical nature of temporary relief followed by deeper financial trouble is a common stressor, as it perpetuates a sense of hopelessness and entrapment. the author's acknowledgment that ""more loans aren't the answer"" and their search for a different kind of help further highlights their awareness of the unsustainable nature of their current coping mechanisms and their desire for a more effective solution. these elements collectively underscore the presence of significant stress, characterized by financial instability, feelings of entrapment, and the search for more sustainable coping strategies."
"My boyfriend is really understanding about everything, but he wants me to eventually come clean to my mother because he thinks that it's unhealthy for me to have to keep this from my mom.

For Christmas, my boyfriend bought me a hat, several CDs, and concert tickets. Irrelevant right?",0,"the narrative describes a supportive relationship with the boyfriend, who is concerned about the narrator's well-being and encourages openness with the mother. while the narrator mentions feeling anxious about revealing something to the mother, the overall tone suggests a manageable level of concern rather than overwhelming stress. the boyfriend's understanding nature and the thoughtful christmas gifts indicate a stable and positive relationship, which can act as a buffer against significant stress. the mention of family dynamics, such as the mother's dominant role and the brother and father's inability to help, is presented in a matter-of-fact manner without signs of intense distress. these elements collectively point to a situation that, while containing some anxiety-inducing factors, does not exhibit the heightened emotional or cognitive symptoms typically associated with significant stress."
"And it may be a bit out of context, but I do have to thank my 4 best men for being here with me all the way, I couldn’t do this without them. Finally, we are here at the present day. It’s been 2 years since we broke up. My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience. I don’t hold any sort of animosity towards her, but I have had the tendency to start to drift off and start pitying myself and reflecting out loud a bit too much when in conversation with my dear friend.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of gratitude and progress, which are generally not indicative of stress. the individual expresses appreciation for their friends and acknowledges their support. while there is mention of a past breakup and the ex's lingering animosity, the person notes that they have mostly moved on and do not harbor any negative feelings. the tendency to drift off and reflect out loud may suggest some residual emotional processing, but it is framed within a context of having moved forward. overall, the narrative lacks the intensity and immediacy of stress-related symptoms, such as overwhelming anxiety, persistent negative thoughts, or significant emotional distress. the emphasis on support, progress, and lack of animosity supports the classification."
"Hi everyone. I met a great guy - let's call him Dave - about a year ago. We started off as friends but started dating around November.

"I do not originate from that country, but my family lives only a 3 hour ride away. After Christmas (which we did not spend together) I came to visit her and her family and eventually spend New Years Eve with them. It was all fine apart from some little ""fights"" between my gf and me. There were always some small things that led to discussions. For example: We went out with the dog and when we got back, my shoes were pretty dirty.",0,"the narrative describes a visit to a significant other's family and highlights typical experiences such as spending time together during the holidays and dealing with minor disagreements. the mention of ""little 'fights'"" and ""small things that led to discussions"" suggests normal relationship dynamics rather than indicators of significant stress. the example provided about the dirty shoes is mundane and does not imply any heightened emotional distress or significant conflict. overall, the tone of the narrative is calm and matter-of-fact, without expressions of overwhelming anxiety, frustration, or other stress-related emotions. these elements collectively suggest a non-stressful experience, reflecting typical everyday interactions and minor inconveniences that do not escalate into major stressors."
"In a shame spiral, validation after asking feedback from peers, I'm over-reacting or too sensitive. Thank god my GF still loves me.

Thank you for reading.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional distress and psychological turmoil. phrases like ""shame spiral,"" ""hypervigilance,"" ""catastrophizing,"" and ""hypersensitivity"" are indicative of significant stress and anxiety. the writer mentions needing validation and feeling overly sensitive, which suggests a struggle with self-esteem and self-worth. the reference to the support of a girlfriend provides a small anchor of stability, but overall, the narrative is marked by intense negative emotions and a sense of being overwhelmed. the act of writing it out for relief further underscores the presence of stress, as it indicates a need to process and manage these intense feelings."
"My brother adopted me and enrolled me in the school his wife taught at. They had a family of their own and I was never treated the same as their children. My future friends referred to them as ""the Dursleys."" I was a few years older than their oldest kid so I attribute their shitty parenting to not knowing how to raise a kid my age at that point yet, because they were much kinder to their kids when they reached my age. They were also quite religious.",0,"the narrative describes a complex family dynamic where the individual was adopted by their brother and his wife, who had their own children. despite feeling different and possibly neglected compared to their adoptive siblings, the individual rationalizes the situation by attributing it to the parents' inexperience with raising an older child. the mention of friends comparing the family to ""the dursleys"" from harry potter suggests a sense of being treated unfairly or harshly, yet the tone of the narrative is reflective rather than emotionally charged. the individual also notes the parents' religiousness without expressing strong negative emotions about it. overall, the narrative contains elements that could be stressful, but the author's perspective seems more analytical and detached, focusing on understanding the reasons behind the treatment rather than expressing significant distress or emotional turmoil."
"It is why I started studying gender studies. My dads rage from my mum earning more then him, even though she gave him at least half whilst he had affaris and caused hell in our household and physically abused her.

Anyway, so i'm reading a book called Toxic Parents and it basically advisers people to confront their parents.",0,"the narrative describes a tumultuous and abusive household environment, with the author witnessing significant domestic conflict and experiencing long-term emotional distress. despite these challenges, the author has taken proactive steps towards understanding and processing their experiences, such as studying gender studies and seeking counseling from a young age. the decision to read literature on toxic parenting and considering confronting their parents indicates a level of self-awareness and a desire for personal growth. these actions suggest a level of resilience and coping mechanisms that may mitigate the acute stress typically associated with such experiences. the narrative, while detailing past hardships, reflects an ongoing effort to manage and overcome the impacts of their upbringing, which may explain the classification."
The next day I called M and told him what happened. He was furious and talked about breaking up and told me I lied to him and he had trust issues because of his ex girlfriend who attacked him with a knife or hatchet or something. And it was one thing after another like that. Often about things that I didn't think were 'lying'. The next thing I knew I wasn't going out anymore because he'd always get mad for some reason.,0,"the narrative describes a sequence of events involving a conversation with someone named ""m"" who reacts with anger and distrust. while the narrative touches on potentially stressful interactions, the focus is on m's reactions rather than the author's emotional state. the author recounts m's accusations of lying and his trust issues stemming from past experiences, specifically mentioning an incident with an ex-girlfriend. the narrative also mentions that the author stopped going out due to m's anger. however, the author's tone appears more descriptive and factual rather than emotive or overwhelmed, indicating an observational recount rather than a personal experience of stress. the lack of explicit emotional language or signs of personal distress in the author's recount suggests that they are not experiencing significant stress themselves."
"I’ve started trying to write things down more. Not necessarily journal but just writing down little ideas I have in various notebooks.

But now, the handwriting doesn’t even look close to before.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's self-awareness and proactive approach to managing their mental health. they describe engaging in a constructive activity, writing down ideas, which can be a therapeutic practice. the mention of noticing changes in handwriting linked to their ptsd indicates a level of introspection and monitoring of symptoms, suggesting they are in tune with their mental state. the tone of the narrative is more observational than distressed, focusing on an interesting change rather than expressing overwhelming concern or anxiety. this level of self-reflection and engagement in positive coping mechanisms are typical indicators of an individual not currently experiencing significant stress."
"We talk about it a lot and we're on the same page on most of things. This just isn't what I've come to discuss, so if it's not intimacy-related, you needn't (and I discourage you to) advise on that. :) Don't worry, we do not take the difference lightly. --- **tl;dr**: Sexually unexperienced longing for sex with long time partner, probably years away from it because he wants to wait till marriage.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of stress, primarily rooted in the individual's sexual frustration and the long wait associated with their partner's desire to wait until marriage. the explicit mention of being ""sexually unexperienced"" and the ""longing for sex"" indicates a deep-seated emotional struggle. the phrase ""probably years away from it"" suggests a prolonged period of unmet needs, which can be a substantial source of stress. the effort to communicate boundaries (""this just isn't what i've come to discuss"") and the reassurance to not worry about their difference in views (""do not worry, we do not take the difference lightly"") further underscores an ongoing internal conflict and the attempt to manage it. these elements are typical indicators of stress as they reflect unresolved desires, prolonged anticipation, and the emotional toll of managing significant differences in intimate expectations within a relationship."
"She didn’t have room for it where she was currently living, it had been so long since she was able to create. We moved things out of storage, into the studio.

"I'm livid....this only proves to me that you can't trust ANYONE not even your friggin therapist. She exploited me...pushing me to do this program wasn't to help me but she did it for herself to try to get a raise, promotion or something. What should I do? I wrote an email to the administrator but I feel like I need to do more....I want the other participants of this program to be notified IMMEDIATELY that their sessions where they talk about very difficult/painful things, things that they don't like talking about, are being used for training purposes and God knows what else. Update: That asshole “therapist” was in fact promoted after pushing people to do this dumb and unethical program...People that play dirty and use people get ahead.",1,"the narrative exhibits clear signs of distress and mistrust, as evidenced by the strong emotional language and accusations against the therapist. the writer expresses feelings of betrayal and anger, which are typical indicators of stress. the mention of feeling exploited and the suspicion that the therapist's motives were self-serving rather than therapeutic suggests a deep sense of violation and helplessness. the writer's urge to take further action and notify other participants reflects an ongoing state of agitation and concern for justice. the narrative's tone, marked by frustration and indignation, aligns with common psychological responses to perceived unethical behavior and breaches of trust, reinforcing the presence of significant stress."

When I finally got the job that I’ve been working towards my entire life, and you got your settlement and the opportunity to do the things you had been talking about doing for your entire life, I began experiencing this odd feeling called “confidence.” Not just having confidence, but being confident. Our situation was finally improving, but our relationship continued to deteriorate. You attempted to exert a level of control over me I had yet to experience (which is saying something). But this time, I resisted.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author reflects on their financial situation and the dynamics within their relationship. despite initial concerns about finances, the author acknowledges that their financial situation has improved, which suggests an absence of financial stress. the mention of achieving a lifelong career goal and experiencing newfound confidence indicates a positive shift in the author's personal life. however, the narrative also touches on relationship issues, specifically the partner's attempt to exert control. while this could be a source of stress, the author's resistance and confidence in dealing with the situation suggest they are handling it well and not overwhelmed by stress. overall, the narrative reflects a complex situation with elements of both improvement and challenge, but the author's confident and proactive stance points to a state of non-stress."
"I dated my ex-girlfriend for 6 years. She was madly in love with me for most of the relationship then had a falling out in the last year of the relationship where things turned ugly.

I have no valid high school diploma as I finished it in Australia and haven't been able to secure my GED due to the time limitations with working everyday and commuting between Compton and Glendale. I appreciate anybody taking the time to read this and welcome any advice. Thanks.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the individual's unstable living situation and the pressure to maintain employment. the concern about potentially spending weekends on the streets if the paycheck is delayed highlights acute anxiety about basic needs and safety. the mention of lacking a valid high school diploma and the challenges in obtaining a ged due to time constraints further adds to the stress, as these educational barriers can limit job opportunities and financial stability. the determination to keep the job despite these hardships suggests a high level of stress related to the fear of job loss and the subsequent impact on their living situation. the overall tone of seeking help and advice underscores a sense of urgency and desperation, common in individuals facing significant life stressors."
"Etc etc etc. "". My brain takes this one little choice -should I go back in the water- and blows it up so big that I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out what I should do, and I end up frozen unable to make ANY decision. Does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal with this?",1,"the narrative reflects a heightened level of anxiety and overthinking, which are common indicators of stress. the author describes a seemingly simple decision - whether to go back in the water - becoming an overwhelming dilemma. the process of spending 20 minutes on such a minor choice and ending up paralyzed by indecision highlights a significant struggle with decision-making, often associated with stress. the plea for validation and advice from others (""does this happen to anyone else? how do you deal with this?"") suggests a sense of isolation and a desire for coping strategies, further underscoring the individual's distress. these elements collectively point to a stressed state of mind."

"My coworkers began noticing that was no longer their happy-go-lucky little teen, but a quiet and distanced serial-killer-faced old woman. I had become less focused and very accident-prone. I was losing my grip and they became increasingly worried about me. They automatically assumed that it had something to do with M; when I didn’t respond to them or look at them, their suspicions were confirmed. They told me that I should leave him, but said nothing and never took that advice.",0,"the narrative describes a significant change in behavior and demeanor, such as becoming quiet, distanced, and accident-prone, which are often indicators of stress. coworkers noticed the change and expressed concern, suggesting a connection to a relationship issue. however, the individual's lack of response to advice and the absence of direct acknowledgment of stress factors may indicate a different underlying cause. the narrative lacks explicit expressions of internal turmoil or distress that are typical indicators of stress. instead, it focuses more on external observations and assumptions made by others rather than the individual's own experience of stress."
"So I’ve been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I don’t go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks. I’m beginning to notice that my anxiety is again incredibly high a lot of the time. By listening to my body I’ve come to realise that caffeine is triggering me. NOW this is new. I’ve been drinking coffee since I was around 17 (22 now) and I’ve never had an issue (infact, it used to put me to sleep) but now whenever I have a coffee (French press at home or latte from a barista) within about 30 minutes I begin to shake and uncontrollably sweat.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing heightened anxiety despite being on medication for a significant period. the individual notes a recent change in their reaction to caffeine, which has become a new trigger for anxiety symptoms such as shaking and uncontrollable sweating. these physical manifestations, along with the mention of incredibly high anxiety levels, are clear indicators of stress. the sudden change in how their body reacts to a previously benign substance like coffee further underscores the presence of stress. additionally, the narrative reflects a sense of concern and self-monitoring, which are common behaviors in individuals dealing with stress and anxiety. the overall tone and detailed account of their physical and emotional state suggest a heightened awareness and preoccupation with their symptoms, reinforcing the conclusion that the person is experiencing significant stress."
"Sally is around the same age, 25 I assume, (can’t confirm numbers, sorry about that) and she quickly became a red flag for me. He would mention her name occasionally and how our love for the same type of shows was shared with Sally. Sally and I met a few times. The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally. I thought that was a little weird, but justified it because 1) I had never met her and thought that would be a great opportunity to and 2) He said maybe the two of them would hit it off.",0,"the narrative discusses an individual reflecting on their experiences with a person named sally, who is associated with the narrator's boyfriend. the narrator describes some initial concerns and awkwardness about sally's presence but ultimately rationalizes these feelings. specific details, such as the shared interest in shows and the shopping trip with mutual friends, suggest that the narrator is processing the situation logically rather than emotionally. the tone of the narrative is more observational and analytical rather than indicative of significant emotional distress. the narrator's ability to justify the situation and find logical explanations for their feelings suggests a level of emotional regulation and absence of overwhelming stress."

"He doesn’t know anything about that though. For some background, I recognize that I tend to overreact to normal things, I have panic attacks when people innocently flirt with me for example, and I’ve flown off the handle when too many men have even just looked at me in too short of a space of time. Anyway, so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didn’t even have a living room, just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it, and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could, because he’s my friend and I care about him. I told him this and he said he cares about me too, and then he started telling me that when he first met me, he was attracted to me but that I was too young so he felt weird.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the author acknowledges a tendency to overreact to normal situations and mentions experiencing panic attacks, which are clear signs of heightened anxiety and stress. the discomfort and distress caused by innocent flirting and the reaction to being looked at by multiple men suggest a heightened state of vigilance and potential social anxiety. the living situation described—a tiny apartment with no living room—can also contribute to stress due to lack of personal space and privacy. the interaction with the roommate, who is dealing with his own emotional issues, adds another layer of stress as the author tries to support him while managing their own feelings. the revelation about the roommate's initial attraction to the author introduces a potentially uncomfortable dynamic, further exacerbating the author's stress. these elements combined illustrate a pattern of stress responses and environmental factors that contribute to the author's overall sense of stress."
"I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.",0,"the narrative reveals a complex interplay of emotions and thoughts. the author expresses feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt, which are common indicators of stress. however, they also mention a strong support system of friends and family, whom they deeply appreciate and love. this social support can be a significant protective factor against stress. the individual acknowledges their struggles with self-worth and describes experiencing occasional depressive thoughts, paranoia, dissociation, and anxiety attacks. despite these challenges, they maintain an overall optimistic outlook and describe themselves as generally upbeat and happy. the fact that they are proactive in seeking help and open to advice further suggests resilience and a positive approach to managing their mental health. this combination of self-awareness, optimism, and support from loved ones likely contributes to their overall well-being, despite the presence of stress-inducing thoughts and experiences."
"There is so much I can't do because I don't drive and it has impacted my life in such a way that it feels like I am in my own personal prison. I have been to therapy but it doesn't seem to work. So I am asking, have any of you overcome this situation? How did you do it? Any advice?",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of entrapment and frustration, which are common indicators of stress. the individual describes their inability to drive as a significant limitation, likening it to being in a ""personal prison,"" which suggests feelings of confinement and helplessness. despite seeking therapy, the lack of perceived improvement further contributes to their distress, indicating that their coping mechanisms are currently ineffective. the plea for advice from others reveals a sense of desperation and a need for external support, underscoring the emotional burden they are carrying. these elements collectively highlight the presence of stress in the individual's life."
"She was really worried about being retraumatized by her birth. At the time I didn’t understand trauma or realize how deep her problems were (since I hadn’t seen them much), but I always listened to her first and foremost. We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents’ house. The birth was precipitous (very fast, only a few hours) and extremely traumatic and painful. No pain medication, and I think the speed of the birth makes it more traumatic, and our son had his hand over his head when he came out.",0,"the narrative details a deeply personal and intense experience surrounding childbirth, highlighting significant concerns and efforts to manage potential trauma. the author describes the planning and execution of a home birth, emphasizing the physical and emotional challenges involved. despite the traumatic and painful nature of the birth, the narrative lacks signs of ongoing stress or anxiety in the author's tone. instead, it focuses on practical actions taken, such as paying out of pocket for the home birth and having a backup hospital plan, indicating a proactive and solution-oriented mindset. the author's reflection on the experience suggests an understanding and acceptance of the events rather than an indication of current stress. the narrative is factual and descriptive without expressing lingering distress or unresolved emotions, which are common indicators of stress."

It’s hard to ask for help. BUT- sometimes WE need help too.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant struggle over the past few years, which is a common indicator of stress. the mention of never asking for help, despite needing it, suggests a sense of pride and self-reliance, but also hints at internal conflict and possible feelings of isolation. the difficulty in asking for help, even when it is clearly needed, can be a sign of stress as it indicates the person may be overwhelmed and unable to cope with the situation alone. the acknowledgment of needing help, despite their usual independence, further emphasizes the level of stress they are experiencing. these elements combined point towards a narrative typical of someone under considerable stress."
"I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment. However, I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool.

The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the individual describes intense anxiety that significantly impacts daily functioning, such as difficulty performing simple tasks like making a phone call. the mention of past traumatic experiences, including rape, and the uncertainty about the origins of their anxiety suggest a deep-rooted psychological struggle. the person also notes being triggered by reminders of their trauma, which exacerbates their anxiety and leads to emotional breakdowns. these elements are characteristic of stress, particularly when related to unresolved trauma and the ongoing impact it has on the person's mental health."
"I hope I can remember that my anxiety was misguided and ultimately wrong. And more than that, I hope that whoever reads this (if anyone does) can remember it too. I wasn't sure how to end this before, and I am not sure how to end it now, so I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes from the great Stanley Kubrick... ***""And remember no matter how vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.

"I had another friend come out and tap on my window, scaring me. He didn’t know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry. I felt stupid and ashamed. Through the sobs I told him what happened, I even told him that my rapists did it to me. He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.",1,"the narrative describes an individual experiencing significant emotional turmoil and distress. the unexpected tapping on the window triggered a strong emotional reaction, leading to crying and feelings of fear. the person expresses feelings of shame and guilt, particularly when recounting a traumatic event involving rape. the supportive response from the friend, while well-intentioned, exacerbated the individual's guilt, highlighting a complex emotional response. these elements, including the intense emotional reactions, feelings of shame, guilt, and the mention of a traumatic experience, are typical indicators of stress. such reactions suggest an ongoing struggle with processing the trauma and the emotional burden it carries."

I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that. She asked me some basic questions and then suggested that I go into walk-in counseling that my school offers because she doesn't want to waste MY time being there. I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better. This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide. She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and disappointment, which are common indicators of stress. the author describes feeling dismissed and invalidated by a therapist, which can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and anxiety. the mention of the therapist suggesting walk-in counseling and not wanting to waste time can contribute to the author's stress, as it suggests a lack of support and understanding. the author's desire to stay and talk about their issues, only to be rushed out, indicates a need for validation and a safe space to express their concerns, which they did not receive. this unmet need for emotional support and the experience of being brushed off can significantly contribute to feelings of stress. the narrative also highlights a sense of being misunderstood and not being taken seriously, which are crucial factors in the experience of stress."

As you can imagine, however, my family is deeply opposed to this.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through expressions of distrust and anxiety. the individual mentions a pervasive inability to trust anyone, which is a common sign of emotional distress and insecurity. the lack of felt love, both platonic and romantic, suggests a profound sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. the anxiety experienced during interactions, especially with those showing interest, highlights social anxiety and fear of vulnerability. the mention of using w**d as a coping mechanism indicates a reliance on substances to manage emotional turmoil, which can be both a symptom and a contributor to ongoing stress. additionally, the conflict with family over this coping method suggests additional stress from familial relationships and lack of support. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with significant psychological stress."
"But even if I don’t make my goal, I pledge to keep fighting for companion animal and pet owner rights. If nothing else, this has opened my eyes. - This is 100% real. I will answer any questions you have, so long as I do not have to name the other person involved. I’m not trying to ruin reputations.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of determination and resilience, which are generally not indicative of stress. the author expresses a commitment to a cause and a willingness to continue their efforts regardless of the outcome, suggesting a proactive and positive mindset. the mention of being open to answering questions, with a specific boundary to protect another person’s reputation, indicates clear thinking and an organized approach to handling the situation. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is managing their circumstances with a level-headed attitude, rather than experiencing overwhelming stress."
"I dont know what to do to be liked again, i guess it would be different if she had hated me from the beginning but that just isnt the case. She also hates my boyfriend and doesnt allow him anywhere near her house. I cant move because the rent is only $500 and I cant afford anything else, and yes, I do have a job. I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said ""because nobody taught you these things"" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure. I try to meditate and to think very very very deep before I say anything, like to try and think of every outcome and if it might make her hate me more then I shouldnt say it.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as feelings of social rejection, financial constraints, and self-doubt. the author expresses concern about being disliked and specifically mentions that a significant person in their life, presumably a roommate or landlord, dislikes both them and their boyfriend. this social tension is compounded by the financial stress of not being able to afford higher rent, which traps the author in an uncomfortable living situation. the author also internalizes negative feedback, interpreting it as a sign of personal failure, which is a common manifestation of stress. their efforts to meditate and carefully consider their words indicate a heightened level of anxiety and a desire to avoid further conflict, underscoring their stressed state."
"I don't know. Pretty sure. But my nose is stuffy from this stupid cold so it'd make sense that I'm having a hard time breathing from it. But I'm also having a hard time breathing through my mouth. I can't find my vapor rub anywhere, which is annoying the crap out of me because I feel like it'd help a little (the mintiness from brushing my teeth helped a tiny bit).",0,"the narrative describes physical discomfort due to a cold, such as a stuffy nose and difficulty breathing. while these symptoms can be frustrating, the tone and content do not suggest a deeper emotional or psychological distress. the individual is focused on practical solutions, like finding vapor rub or brushing their teeth to alleviate symptoms. the annoyance expressed is directed towards the immediate physical discomfort rather than broader or more pervasive issues. this indicates that the narrative reflects a temporary and situational irritation rather than ongoing stress. the lack of emotional language or mention of stressors beyond the cold supports the classification."
"Now he is enraged because I said months ago that maybe internet access was not a bad idea, that there was some stuff there that may connect him more to others. He had been asking for months how to access the internet for free, and I just did not know what to say, he mentioned it so much, besides he would have to get internet access from a company if he wanted to use the internet reliably. So he did that at some point, and is now having issues. It just looks like an older man who is having difficulty navigating the internet and who finds Apple care unhelpful. But he is phoning me today yelling and accusing me of paranoid stuff and hanging up.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual is dealing with an older man's frustration over internet access and technical difficulties. while the situation involves conflict and some degree of tension, the primary focus is on the older man's struggles rather than the narrator's emotional state. the narrator provides a rational explanation of the events and the older man's reactions, indicating a problem-solving approach rather than expressing personal distress. the narrative does not include signs of overwhelming anxiety, helplessness, or emotional turmoil that are typically associated with stress. instead, it reflects a scenario of dealing with someone else's frustration, which is managed with a level-headed perspective."

We really love this RV and would hate to see it abandoned for parts somewhere, but we have no connections in Madison, WI. We are ready to pay cash money to anyone in the area that has a Chevy 454 radiator or knows an RV Wizard and can help us in the next couple of days.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a mechanical issue with an rv and the subsequent need for repairs. while it does detail an unexpected and potentially stressful event, the tone remains relatively composed and solution-focused. the author mentions a willingness to pay for help and expresses a clear plan to resolve the issue, which suggests a level of control and resourcefulness. there is no evident language indicating overwhelming distress, anxiety, or a sense of helplessness. instead, the narrative maintains a pragmatic approach to solving the problem, which is not typically indicative of someone experiencing significant stress."

"For the past couple months I have had really bad soreness and tightness in my upper back and neck. Sometimes it gets so stiff I can barely move my head. At first i thought it was a physical injury so I went to the doctors and had an xray but they could not find anything. I notice it flares up when im anxious. I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.",1,"the narrative describes persistent physical symptoms such as soreness and tightness in the upper back and neck, which are common somatic manifestations of stress. the individual mentions that the stiffness can become so severe that it limits their movement, indicating a significant impact on daily functioning. despite seeking medical advice and undergoing diagnostic tests, no physical injury was identified, suggesting that the symptoms might have a psychosomatic origin. the person also observes that these symptoms worsen during periods of anxiety, directly linking their physical discomfort to emotional stress. the various self-care attempts, including massages, creams, and baths, reflect a struggle to find relief, further emphasizing the ongoing nature of their stress. these elements collectively indicate that the individual is experiencing stress, as their narrative aligns with common psychological and physiological responses to prolonged stress and anxiety."
"Hi guys! My close friend has been struggling lately to pay for her dog's surgery. Two months ago, she noticed a lump on her dog's leg. After running a few tests and getting several vet's opinions, the dog was diagnosed with Grade 2 soft tissue sarcoma. She had three options, do nothing, remove lump and go for chemo treatments, or amputate the leg completely.",1,"the narrative describes a situation involving a close friend's struggle with her dog's serious medical condition. the mention of financial difficulties in paying for the surgery highlights a common stressor related to monetary concerns. the diagnosis of grade 2 soft tissue sarcoma and the subsequent tough choices regarding treatment options (doing nothing, surgery with chemo, or amputation) indicate high-stakes decision-making and emotional turmoil. these elements collectively suggest significant stress, as they involve worry about a beloved pet's health, potential financial strain, and the emotional weight of making life-altering decisions. such scenarios are typical indicators of stress due to their complex, emotionally charged, and uncertain nature."
"I decided to park behind it to see what their business was. They called 911 on me.

And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual experiences significant stress and anxiety. the act of parking behind a vehicle to observe their business suggests a heightened state of vigilance and suspicion, which are common indicators of stress. the sudden involvement of the police and the presence of ""copper stoppers"" heighten the tension, illustrating the person's growing concern and panic. the decision to pull into the driveway and quickly unload the kids indicates a rushed and stressed reaction to the unexpected situation. the narrative further intensifies as the police approach the individual and follow the children into the house, which would understandably escalate feelings of distress and fear. these elements collectively point to a scenario where the person is under considerable stress, as evidenced by their actions and the unfolding events."
"We will be using THE RESPECTFUL PROSTITUTE by Jean Paul Sartre This is to be one presentation that includes all of these elements. I HIGHLY recommend a PowerPoint.

I don't have anything to hide, so I told her.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is sharing personal passwords with another person, possibly a partner. despite the initial reluctance, the individual complies without much resistance, suggesting a level of trust and acceptance in the relationship. the tone of the narrative does not indicate significant emotional distress or anxiety; rather, it reflects a rational decision-making process and a sense of normalcy in sharing personal information. the mention of the other person getting upset when the pin was changed could be a minor stressor, but the individual's response indicates a lack of internal conflict or significant emotional turmoil. overall, the narrative lacks signs of pervasive worry, heightened emotional responses, or other psychological indicators typically associated with stress."
"Writing these helps sooth my own wounds, and I was wondering if people would be willing to read them/have story ideas? I mostly write shortish scenes about having to talk about it and being consoled (most from the perspective of a woman being the survivor, man being the comforter--though I'm always willing to try different genders and sexualities). I'll mostly have these on Kindle as a series, but I have some out on websites <url> (the series is called <name>) The Kindle ones will be longer and more in depth. Please let me know--these help me and I want them to help others!",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who finds solace in writing and is seeking to connect with others through their work. the act of writing is mentioned as a means of self-soothing, which is a healthy coping mechanism rather than an indication of acute stress. the writer expresses a clear purpose and direction in their work, showing a sense of control and proactive behavior. the mention of sharing their stories and asking for feedback or ideas suggests an openness to social interaction and community engagement, which are positive signs of emotional well-being. the overall tone of the narrative is hopeful and constructive, focusing on helping themselves and others, which aligns more with a balanced emotional state rather than one dominated by stress."

"That is a waste of energy. I know and have lived your combative relationship with both your parents. First, it is your dad, then you go to your mom, then it is your mom and you go to your dad...... you are playing them and that is very manipulative. You are 28 years old, a young man that needs to grow up. Take responsibilty for yourself.",0,"the narrative reflects a tone of frustration and disappointment directed towards another individual. it describes a pattern of behavior where the person alternates between parents, which is labeled as manipulative. the mention of age and the need to take responsibility indicates an expectation for maturity and self-accountability. while the content involves conflict and critical feedback, it does not exhibit signs of stress in the author. instead, the narrative focuses on providing a candid assessment of someone else's actions and urging them to grow up. the direct and assertive language, combined with the absence of personal distress or anxiety about the situation, suggests that the author is more concerned with conveying a message of personal responsibility rather than expressing their own stress."
"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance. The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in. My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either. Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm. I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep-seated concern about the father's behavior and the potential repercussions on the family. the writer's description of their father's deceit, arrogance, and scheming nature indicates a significant source of ongoing stress. the uncertainty about the father's potential actions, combined with the fear of him getting out and causing further harm, adds to the anxiety. the mention of considering a restraining order and the appointment with a doctor also highlights the steps being taken to manage the situation, reflecting the gravity of the stress involved. the writer's detailed recounting of events and the emotional weight they carry are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."
"I honestly thought it might be similar to calling tech support, getting escalated to a manager, then actually getting results. I thought they might have resources I haven't had/didn't know about yet. They didn't, they called the police and filed a false claim (I was standing on top of a parking garage ready to jump - not true). Police came, spoke with me, decided I needed to go to the hospital against my will. I tried to reason and explain most of my depression and anxiety was financially related and this would make it worse.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual sought help expecting useful resources but was met with an unexpected and distressing response from authorities. they recount the escalation to police involvement and being taken to the hospital against their will. despite their attempt to rationalize their financial-related depression and anxiety, the authorities' intervention only compounded their stress. the detailed recounting of events and the expression of frustration highlight a series of stressful interactions, yet the narrative maintains a level of coherence and a lack of pervasive emotional distress that might otherwise be expected in a highly stressed individual. the focus on logical reasoning and explanation of circumstances rather than emotional overwhelm suggests a more controlled state of mind."
"&nbsp; This piece of art I’ve used is a perfect example of how having solid boundaries can help me weather any storm. I know I’m going to get kicked, I know I’m going to be in pain but I also see the beauty in between the clouds. This is a painting I did freezing in the hail and storm on the rocks of Alloutte Lake. The waves crashed, the mist covered the mountains but every now and then brilliant colour would flash.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resilience and appreciation for beauty despite challenging circumstances. the individual describes experiencing harsh weather conditions while painting, yet they focus on the positive aspects, such as the ""brilliant colour"" that appears intermittently. the mention of ""solid boundaries"" suggests a strong sense of self and the ability to maintain composure in difficult situations. this perspective indicates a coping mechanism that is effective and healthy, allowing the person to find moments of beauty and calm amidst chaos. the overall tone of the narrative is one of acceptance and strength, rather than distress, highlighting the person's ability to manage and thrive despite external stressors."
"I was greeted by the message ""your Facebook account has been disabled...."" when I tried to log in couple of months back.

This account was really important to me. Excluding family photos and memories, I owned couple of pages with huge fan following.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the immediate emotional response to the disabled facebook account, described as ""really important to me,"" suggests a significant personal investment and attachment. the frustration and helplessness are evident in the phrases ""no response from them"" and ""appeals are going to trash,"" which indicate a lack of control over the situation and a sense of being ignored or dismissed. the mention of ""family photos and memories"" and ""pages with huge fan following"" highlights the loss of meaningful connections and achievements, exacerbating the stress. the prolonged duration of the issue, ""it has been two months,"" without resolution further intensifies the stress, as the individual has been enduring this unresolved problem for an extended period. these elements collectively point to a narrative characterized by stress."
"one day i broke down into absolute tears and was rushed into the counselers office. at this point im in 8th grade and this is by no means acceptable behavior. we are about to go into high school and i just burst into a ball of tears in front of every last one of my peers. the good thing is, this scenario made me care a little less about what everyone thought of me due to the already absolute embarrassment of myself. My mindset, the people i surrounded myself with, and my family life were all fucked to say the least... especially family.",0,"the narrative describes a significant emotional breakdown in front of peers, which led to a visit to the counselor's office. the author reflects on the event with a sense of embarrassment but also mentions a shift in perspective, caring less about others' opinions afterward. while the narrative recounts a moment of high emotional intensity, it is described as a past event with some degree of resolution. the individual notes that their mindset, social circles, and family life were problematic, yet there is an absence of ongoing distress or acute symptoms in the present tense. the tone suggests a level of acceptance and learning from the experience rather than continued suffering or stress. this indicates that the narrative, despite touching on past difficulties, does not reflect current, pervasive stress."
"Nevertheless, he looks like someone I would like to be friends with, but I'm too afraid to actually speak to him at this point, so I figured I could write him a letter. I don't want to assume he can read like I read (given the white cane), so I think it would be a good idea to write him a letter in braille and maybe including a written copy as well. I have read that I should acquire a slate and a stylus to write braille by hand, but I would love some more help or tips if anyone knows how to write in braille. Are there any services that will transcribe a written letter to braille that don't cost very much? Thank you!",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and considerate approach to making a new friend, particularly someone with a visual impairment. the writer expresses a desire to communicate effectively and respectfully by considering the use of braille. this shows empathy and a proactive attitude rather than signs of stress. the inquiries about how to write in braille and seeking affordable transcription services indicate a willingness to learn and adapt. there is no evidence of overwhelming anxiety or distress; instead, the writer seems focused on practical steps to achieve their goal. the tone is inquisitive and solution-oriented, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I listen to him when he’s having a bad day and thinking about what I did to him. I listen and try to say silent when he yells and screams at me. I take his insults in stride, as best as I can, because I feel like I deserve it. He tells me that he “has no respect for me” and I am “nothing but a mistake” and he tells me that I am trash, I do not deserve anything that I have, and that I am just a waste of his time. He tells me that he hates me.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes enduring verbal abuse and insults, which can significantly impact mental health. phrases like ""i listen and try to stay silent when he yells and screams at me"" and ""i take his insults in stride, as best as i can"" suggest a constant exposure to negative and aggressive behavior. the repeated derogatory comments such as ""i am nothing but a mistake,"" ""i am trash,"" and ""i do not deserve anything that i have"" reflect a demeaning environment that can lead to feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem. the statement ""i feel like i deserve it"" indicates internalized guilt and self-blame, which are common in individuals experiencing chronic stress. the overall tone and content of the narrative highlight a distressing and toxic relationship dynamic, typical indicators of someone under significant emotional and psychological strain."
"If its the wrong place for this feel free too delete, it would be on par with the rest of the day. Edit: thank you, too those who've responded and any others who might.

So thank you, it means a lot to me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of gratitude and relief rather than stress. the individual acknowledges the possibility of their post being deleted but does so in a resigned and accepting manner rather than an anxious one. they express appreciation for the responses they have received, indicating a positive reception to the support offered. the mention of feeling like their problems are insignificant compared to others' struggles is common but doesn't necessarily indicate stress; it may simply reflect a comparative perspective. overall, the tone is more about feeling heard and valued, which are signs of emotional support and validation rather than indicators of stress."
"He would tell me it was the best university in the world(a white lie) and how great it was. I didn't want to go there. I didn't aid in the application process at all. He did everything. He wanted me to go there because it was cheap, and he assumed that if it were otherwise either i would just do nothing or spend a lot more money on school than he'd like.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is recounting their experience with someone else's decision-making regarding their education. despite the apparent lack of personal enthusiasm or involvement in the application process, the tone does not convey significant emotional distress or anxiety. the individual's detachment from the process and the practical considerations mentioned (such as cost) suggest a pragmatic acceptance rather than a stressed reaction. the absence of language indicating worry, pressure, or emotional turmoil supports the conclusion that the individual is not experiencing stress in this context. the focus on factual recounting rather than emotional response is typical of someone who is not under stress."
"all the sudden all the hate turned against me again (happened often before). She yelled out, whining for her dad, who she called. i stayed calm but was totally clueless about what to do. she started breaking up with me, telling me that she will spent the night at a hotel or somewhere on the street. i shouldnt come visit her at the hospital next week ... blackmailing me basically.",0,"the narrative describes a highly emotional and conflict-ridden situation involving a relationship dispute. the individual recounts an episode where they were the target of anger and faced threats of a breakup. despite the intensity of the situation, the narrator mentions staying calm, which could indicate a level of emotional regulation and resilience. although the events described are distressing, the lack of explicit expressions of personal anxiety, worry, or ongoing stress symptoms suggests that the individual might not be experiencing significant stress. the focus is more on recounting the incident rather than on their internal emotional state, which can be an indicator of someone processing events without substantial stress impact."
"At the shelter we are not allowed to store food in our locker (they do random checks), but i can keep some stuff in my backpack.

"Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet. I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up. My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity. But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse. Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",1,"the narrative describes a series of events that clearly reflect significant stress and anxiety. the individual starts by mentioning how their anxiety was exacerbated by excessive coffee consumption, a common stimulant that can intensify anxiety symptoms. physical manifestations of stress are evident as they describe shaking and an inability to lift their head. the avoidance behavior, such as stepping out for a smoke, further illustrates attempts to manage overwhelming feelings. the narrative also highlights the impact of anxiety on social interactions, as the person laments missing out on a ""golden opportunity"" due to their condition. when confiding in their girlfriend, who is a nurse, the individual notes her professional response of asking further questions, indicating a deeper engagement with their mental health issues. the casual mention of having to disclose their anxiety to others suggests a chronic condition that significantly affects their daily life and interactions. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and anxiety."
It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped. I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130 pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop. He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath.

When we met, dated, and eventually married, he was under the influence of Vicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation involving the author's husband, who is an injured veteran with a history of serious injuries sustained in iraq and afghanistan. despite the gravity of his injuries and the fact that he was under the influence of strong pain medications like vicodin, oxycontin, and percocet when they met, the narrative does not exhibit clear signs of stress from the author. the tone appears factual and descriptive rather than emotional or distressed. the author does not express feelings of being overwhelmed, anxious, or under significant pressure. instead, the focus is on providing background information about her husband's condition and their relationship, which suggests that she is managing the situation with a level of acceptance and composure. this absence of emotional language or indicators of personal distress aligns with the classification."
"Maybe 2-3 crazy fights but nothing major. Joe came back, frankly Joe spent ~ a year asking me to go out with him and my gut did not agree, it just felt off, now don’t get me wrong I have loved Joe since I was 17 but I just felt like this wouldn’t be right. I asked Joe for a year, I studied far away, and it was my last year at uni, I asked Joe to give me that year. But Joe said Nah. Joe gave the whole I have changed speech which every girl has probably heard a gazillion times in her life, but still thinks its novel.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving some interpersonal conflict and decision-making, but it does not convey a high level of distress or emotional turmoil. the mention of ""2-3 crazy fights"" suggests some disagreements, but the phrase ""nothing major"" downplays their significance. the writer talks about joe persistently asking her out, and although she had reservations, her feelings are described in a calm and reflective manner. she acknowledges her love for joe since she was 17, yet she rationally decided that pursuing a relationship at that time wouldn't be right. the request for joe to give her a year to finish her studies indicates a level-headed approach to balancing personal and academic priorities. overall, the narrative reflects thoughtful contemplation rather than acute stress, as the writer seems to handle the situation with a clear sense of perspective and control."
"I’m so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents. I just called to check the file at my university and out of all those professors, only one submitted a course evaluation. I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors.",1,"the narrative reveals significant frustration and anxiety, which are common indicators of stress. the writer expresses anger and disappointment due to unmet expectations from their professors, which is a clear sign of stress. the timeline mentioned, starting from april and leading up to an application deadline in a month, adds pressure and a sense of urgency. the repeated efforts to communicate and the lack of response contribute to feelings of helplessness and lack of control, exacerbating stress levels. the writer's reliance on these letters for their future academic plans further heightens the stakes, making the situation more stressful. the combination of anger, urgency, and the critical nature of the task at hand are all classic signs of a stressed individual."
"I do not get paid until next Tuesday and i am terrified of what i am going to do until then. Any advice would be appreciated of what to do. Normally although i have my heath problems and we live pay-day to pay-day, it has never been this bad as to where i am scared of how i am going to feed my child for nearly a week and i really have no idea how to overcome this.

I cannot walk any where near as far to go any citizens advice.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the financial instability and the urgent concern for basic needs such as feeding a child. the individual explicitly mentions being terrified and scared, emotions that are strong indicators of stress. the mention of living pay-day to pay-day highlights a chronic stressor related to financial insecurity, which is exacerbated by the current situation of having no funds until the next pay day. the health problems mentioned add another layer of stress, particularly because they limit the individual's ability to seek help, as noted by the inability to walk far to get advice. the plea for any form of help or advice underscores a sense of desperation and anxiety, common in stressful situations where immediate solutions are not apparent. overall, the narrative captures a high level of emotional distress, uncertainty, and a lack of resources, all of which are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."

Now that I texted him, that I opened that door again.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and regret, which are common indicators of stress. the writer mentions feeling ruined after reaching out, suggesting that the act of communication with this person has a negative impact on their emotional state. the phrase ""i opened that door again"" implies a sense of dread or anxiety about rekindling a connection that might have been closed for a reason. the contrast between the positive response from the other person and the writer's own negative reaction highlights an internal conflict and emotional burden. these elements point towards an ongoing struggle with unresolved feelings and the stress associated with managing them."
"Physical abuse wise my dad had beat me several times, I never really understood that it was abuse until not that long ago, things like hitting my legs together what seemed like as hard as he could, hitting me on the face as hard as he could, threatening to choke me out, etc. it overall made me feel pretty disassociated, I just didn't really understand why though, my relationship with my parents became this extremely hollow thing that felt like an obligation rather than having genuine parents. as I got older from 10 on they became increasingly mentally abusive on top of it, at age 11 my dad found out that I'm trans by looking on my computer and screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hospitalize me (He didnt know mental hospitals wont hospitalize people for it, and might've ended up trying to put me into conversion therapy or something) this is around where my mental health completely snapped, going into 7th grade, hitting age 12, I started becoming extremely suicidal, I thought about hanging myself at school or stabbing myself, it became too much to bear, not being able to be openly trans, being beaten, feeling on edge non stop, feeling completely invalidated to the core of who I am as a person. I became morbidly depressed and stayed that way from then on.",1,"the narrative describes experiences of severe physical and emotional abuse, which are significant indicators of stress. the individual recounts being beaten and threatened by their father, leading to feelings of disassociation and a hollow relationship with their parents. the revelation of being trans and the subsequent reaction from the father, including threats and prolonged verbal abuse, exacerbated the individual's mental health struggles. the progression into suicidal ideation and deep depression are clear signs of the overwhelming stress and trauma endured. these elements, including the ongoing physical and mental abuse, invalidation of identity, and the constant state of fear and edge, are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."
"Anyway, long story short, he came over, we had a blast, we had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled, and he fell asleep on me. Four nights later the same thing happened :-) On our second date he told me he had anxiety issues and I just tried to listen to him. He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American. Last night he came over and he told me had anxiety and depression issues and he's seeing a doctor.",0,"the narrative describes a series of positive and enjoyable experiences, such as having dinner, watching a movie, cuddling, and spending time together, which are indicative of a pleasant and relaxed state. the mention of the second date where the partner opened up about his anxiety issues is met with understanding and support, rather than causing distress to the narrator. the narrator's empathetic response to their partner's mental health disclosures shows a level of emotional stability and resilience. the narrative also includes a smiley face, suggesting a light-hearted and happy tone. overall, the narrative focuses on positive interactions and supportive communication, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"Sunday (the 5th) she went outside to drink her margarita, and our 4 year old followed her (she'd been ignoring us all day). I went to help my 5 year old when she called me into the bathroom.

"The first six months I had her she lived in a cage that could have fit two rats, the next year and a half she lived in a cage that could have fit four rats (this is following the formula where you multiply the dimensions of the cage in inches and divide it by 3456. The result tells you how many rats you can comfortably have in one cage.) I loved buying her new toys and treats and seeing how she took them. Trying new foods on her was one of my favorite things to do. The only issue is that I didn't really let her out of the cage much.",0,"the narrative describes the experience of caring for a pet rat, detailing the progression of the cage size and the enjoyment derived from providing new toys and treats. the tone is reflective and factual, focusing on the specifics of the pet's living conditions and the owner's pleasure in engaging with the pet. there is no mention of personal distress, overwhelming emotions, or significant challenges, which are often indicators of stress. instead, the narrative centers around a structured routine and a sense of satisfaction from caring for the pet, suggesting a stable and content state of mind. the mention of not letting the rat out of the cage much is noted as an issue, but it is presented in a straightforward manner without emotional distress, further supporting the absence of stress indicators."
"Each insult he roared, each that lie he told, and each bone that he almost broke became a brick of foundation boosting her will. She greatly missed the boy she fell in love with, but after years of torment and suffering she grew sick of her own lies. She hated the person she had become, and she was shocked to learn the number of years she wasted on him. So on an insignificant, sweltering day in July, she broke free of that little world they created, and finally rejoined the real one. Edit: typo",0,"the narrative details a tumultuous relationship marked by emotional and possibly physical abuse. the individual reflects on the pain and suffering endured over the years, indicating a significant period of hardship. however, the crucial turning point comes when she decides to leave the toxic environment and reclaims her autonomy. the act of breaking free and rejoining the real world signifies a powerful moment of liberation and self-empowerment. despite the negative experiences, the narrative ends on a note of resolution and personal growth, suggesting a transition from a state of distress to one of recovery and resilience. the overall tone shifts from recounting past struggles to embracing a hopeful future, which aligns more with a narrative of overcoming adversity rather than being entrenched in ongoing stress."
"First post here, using a throwaway because for some reason I just don't want my regular reddit account attached, despite being fairly open about the fact I was raped. But I digress. In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with. I was diagnosed with PTSD in September. The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, primarily stemming from a traumatic event. the individual explicitly mentions being raped by their ex-boyfriend, an experience that has profoundly impacted their mental health. the diagnosis of ptsd in september highlights the severity of their psychological distress. frequent intrusive thoughts about the rape and the perpetrator suggest ongoing mental turmoil. the use of a throwaway account indicates a desire for privacy and possibly shame or fear of judgment, despite their openness about the incident. the language used, such as ""flipped my life entirely upside down,"" underscores the deep disruption and continuous emotional pain they are experiencing. these elements collectively point to a state of significant stress and trauma."

"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it.

They'd never met before this.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the uncertainty and insecurity expressed by the individual. the writer questions whether their feelings of insecurity are justified, suggesting a preoccupation with doubt and self-worth. the mention of the boyfriend meeting another girl and engaging in her hobby, especially on a first date, heightens the writer's anxiety and suspicion. this situation could be perceived as a threat to the stability of their relationship, further amplifying stress levels. the writer's need for advice underscores a sense of helplessness and the desire for external validation, which are common stress responses. overall, the combination of insecurity, doubt, and the context of a potentially destabilizing relationship event are clear indicators of stress."

My issue is, he’s going back overseas for uni in a couple of days, and we’ll be seeing each other (in our larger group) tomorrow. Should I bring something up? Should I just leave it?",1,"the narrative displays several indicators of stress, primarily rooted in the confusion and anxiety about the author's feelings and the impending separation from someone significant. the mention of ""going crazy"" suggests a heightened emotional state, indicative of mental distress. the author is preoccupied with thoughts about a person and unfamiliar experiences, which contributes to their confusion and stress. the uncertainty about how to handle the situation—whether to bring something up or leave it—reflects indecision and worry about potential outcomes. this type of rumination and concern over interpersonal relationships is a common stressor, particularly when compounded by the imminent departure of the person in question. the narrative's tone and content suggest the author is grappling with emotional turmoil and uncertainty, both of which are hallmark signs of stress."

I don't think the users there are harsh from what I saw but I think the whole atmosphere they are preserving there (I think the moderators encourage it) is kinda unhelpful to be honest...and I think the moderators there are shady and harsh. I think some of the resources are good but I just mean the forum. I'm scared to post this here but I don't know where else would be good to ask so I'm taking the risk.

"For the rest of the 7 years, I’ve received different forms of violent punishments. I don’t want to get into it but they involved sharp objects, attempts to drown me, paddling, etc. I was generally OK growing up, didn’t think about the abuse a lot, but friends started noticing strange behaviors and phobias that I cannot hide. Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist.

"But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment. Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism. Not that he deserves it.

But how she phrased this thought was with the question ""are you trustworthy"".",0,"the narrative reflects a person attending therapy and discussing interactions with their therapist. the individual mentions a specific conversation where the therapist expressed concern about trust issues. despite the potentially unsettling nature of the question ""are you trustworthy,"" the narrative does not exhibit signs of acute stress. the tone remains calm and reflective rather than anxious or distressed. the individual seems to be processing the therapist's concern thoughtfully, without showing signs of heightened emotional distress or overwhelming worry. this measured response suggests a stable state of mind, rather than one characterized by stress."
"He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better. And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up. Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together. I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?"" keeps returning.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and distress. the individual recounts deeply painful experiences, including verbal abuse and sexual assault, which are clear indicators of trauma. the mention of the ex-partner's harmful behaviors and the struggle with self-doubt about leaving the relationship suggest ongoing psychological conflict and emotional pain. the person’s reflection on their inability to move on and their recurring thoughts about whether the situation was truly as bad as it seemed highlight the internal struggle and cognitive dissonance often seen in those experiencing stress. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress and emotional distress."
"Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking. Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe, once or twice a week for a couple hours. She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks, and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple, but... It wasn't enough. The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of an individual experiencing stress. the recounting of limited social interactions, such as only being able to talk to one friend during specific hours due to restrictive phone policies, suggests a sense of isolation and loneliness. the tension with the sister, who lashes out and accuses the narrator of ingratitude, adds to the emotional strain. the narrator's inability to remember the trigger for snapping back indicates a potential overwhelmed mental state. further, the loss of contact with others except for the sporadic conversations with the one friend highlights a significant reduction in social support. the mention of self-hatred, self-disgust, and internalizing negative beliefs imposed by the father are classic signs of emotional distress and low self-esteem. these factors combined paint a picture of someone grappling with significant stress and its impact on their mental well-being."
"I went to hang with friends for a movie night and it was wonderful. But damn, I felt really inferior. My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel I’m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD. I’ve been doing a lot of therapy work around traumas I have experienced as a child, and that’s been good but also really hard. I’m just having a rough time tonight.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators that suggest the author is experiencing stress. the individual describes feelings of inferiority and inadequacy when comparing themselves to their friends, which can be a significant source of stress. they mention chronic pain, low immunity, and ptsd, all of which are serious health issues that can contribute to an ongoing state of stress. the reference to ongoing therapy for childhood traumas indicates that the person is actively working through significant emotional and psychological challenges, which can be both beneficial and taxing. the culmination of these factors, especially the statement about having a rough time tonight, underscores the presence of stress in the author's life. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with substantial stressors, both physical and emotional."
"The rare times we have fought in the past, I’ve always had to be the one to ‘break the ice,’ regardless of the circumstances of the argument. I don’t have it in me to go grovel for the comfort I sorely need. Now I’m just trying to cry myself asleep. What’s the point of having a partner if they can’t offer the most basic level of emotional support? Is the writing on the wall - is he just too immature, and how did this parent/child dynamic creep in to our relationship?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as feelings of emotional exhaustion and frustration. the author expresses a sense of responsibility in mending conflicts, which contributes to their emotional burden. the phrase ""i dont have it in me to go grovel for the comfort i sorely need"" highlights a deep sense of despair and a lack of emotional support from their partner. the mention of crying oneself to sleep is a strong sign of emotional distress. questioning the point of having a partner and the emergence of a parent/child dynamic further indicates significant relationship stress and dissatisfaction. these elements collectively suggest that the author is experiencing considerable stress."
"So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety. So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down. Now instead of having a panic attack I'm having body symptoms of it. I can't think myself form the symptoms. I can't find the trigger it just happened.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant psychological distress, characterized by extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety. these are clear indicators of stress, as derealization often occurs when someone is overwhelmed and feeling detached from reality. the individual mentions trying to manage their anxiety by ignoring their thoughts, which suggests a coping mechanism that may not be entirely effective. this suppression of anxiety can lead to physical symptoms, as the person describes experiencing body symptoms of a panic attack without a clear trigger. the inability to identify a trigger and the persistence of symptoms indicate an ongoing struggle with stress. the narrative's focus on both psychological and physical manifestations of distress further supports the classification."
Nothing He kicked the door 18-36-30 He kicked it again and until he was sure his foot would bruise Calm down,1,"the narrative describes a person repeatedly kicking a door to the point of causing physical harm to themselves, which is a clear indication of stress. the repetitive and aggressive action of kicking the door suggests a significant level of frustration or anger. the phrase ""until he was sure his foot would bruise"" highlights the intensity and lack of control over his actions, which are common signs of stress. additionally, the command ""calm down"" implies an attempt to regain composure, indicating that the individual recognizes their heightened emotional state. these elements together point to a person experiencing stress, as they exhibit both physical and emotional manifestations of distress."
"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

"I can't begin to summarise how I feel about her. I want to spend the rest of my life with this person, but I want to help work through this stuff together. Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair. What strategies can help break the spiral when she starts one, and how can I approach the topic of seeing a counsellor and developing mindfulness strategies without her going into a panic attack? Help me /r/anxiety, you're my only hope.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress, particularly stemming from the writer's concern for a loved one dealing with anxiety. the writer expresses feelings of helplessness and uncertainty about how to support their partner effectively, which is a common indicator of stress. phrases like ""completely at a loss"" and ""help me /r/anxiety, you are my only hope"" highlight the writer's desperation and sense of urgency. additionally, the mention of wanting to introduce strategies like counseling and mindfulness without triggering a panic attack underscores the delicate and high-stakes nature of the situation, further pointing to the writer's stress. the emotional weight and the search for solutions in an online forum also suggest that the writer feels overwhelmed and in need of external support, typical signs of someone experiencing stress."
"I went there on autopilot, I was blank inside and I was ready to jump. My counsellor saw me through the window and called me on the phone, trying to distract me so she could send help over to me. Campus was pretty much empty, everyone in exams or already finished for the summer and I felt at peace. I was gently talked away from the edge by campus security and they took me to see my counsellor. I havent seen her since this happened and Im due back at uni next week.",1,"the narrative describes a series of events that are indicative of significant emotional distress. the individual mentions feeling ""blank inside"" and being ""ready to jump,"" which are clear indicators of severe emotional turmoil and suicidal ideation. the involvement of a counsellor who intervenes by calling and sending help suggests that the person was in a critical state of mind, requiring immediate assistance. the setting described as a mostly empty campus due to exams or summer break could contribute to feelings of isolation, exacerbating the stress. the narrative also mentions a sense of peace, which can be paradoxical and may indicate resignation or a momentary calm before a potential crisis. the fact that the individual has not seen their counsellor since the incident but is due back at university soon might suggest ongoing unresolved issues and potential anxiety about returning to the same environment. these elements collectively point to a narrative of someone experiencing significant stress and emotional distress."
"Any help would be appreciated, after this coming paycheck everything should be ok.

"Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office, giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror. We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow. And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done. For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused. He ruined my life without me even being aware.",1,"the narrative describes a series of traumatic and abusive experiences that have had a profound impact on the individual's psychological well-being. specific examples, such as being slapped so hard that their face went numb, being pinned and beaten for an extended period, and being repeatedly punched in the head, are clear indicators of severe physical abuse. the mention of developing poor coping mechanisms and not recognizing the abuse for a long time highlights a significant level of emotional and psychological distress. the description of the abuser's gleeful look after the assaults further emphasizes the terror and helplessness experienced by the individual. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress, trauma, and the long-term detrimental effects on the individual's mental health."
"He would distract me while I drove us places, until at one point, I backed into a parked truck, and I had never been the cause of an accident before. After that, I was not allowed to drive my own car. I was not allowed to drive my own car at all after that, unless I found the keys and snuck away, which was oftentimes very difficult. The summer of 2010, he forced me to move in with him, into a terrible run down duplex off campus, so that he could keep his mother’s pair of small, under socialized dogs who were not housebroken, and his sister, who was, with her husband, to begin college classes at this same university that fall, foisted her hyper 40 pound mutt on top of the burden as well. I will not lie, and say I am the cleanest person on earth.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events that suggest a controlling and restrictive relationship, with specific incidents like being prevented from driving and being forced to move into a subpar living situation. despite these potentially stressful circumstances, the tone of the narrative lacks a strong emotional response typically associated with stress. the author recounts the events in a somewhat detached manner, focusing more on the facts rather than expressing feelings of distress, anxiety, or frustration. the absence of emotional language or signs of internal turmoil, such as statements of feeling overwhelmed or anxious, suggests that the individual may not be experiencing significant stress. instead, the narrative reads as a straightforward account of past events without clear indicators of psychological strain."
"EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep. My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe. --- **tl;dr**: I can't stay awake during tv/movies! Don't want it to drive a wedge between my boyfriend and I.",0,"the narrative discusses issues with falling asleep and snoring, but it lacks signs typically associated with high levels of stress. the concern about falling asleep during tv or movies and its potential impact on the relationship is mentioned, but the tone and content do not suggest overwhelming anxiety or distress. instead, it seems to be more about a practical issue and a desire to maintain a healthy relationship. the mention of snoring and breathing problems may indicate a physical health concern rather than an emotional or psychological one. overall, the narrative focuses on a specific problem with sleep and its minor effect on the relationship, without broader indications of stress such as pervasive worry, irritability, or emotional turmoil."

"Edit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences. I don't think I've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and I just want to say thank you. I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread. I've read every post here and will keep reading them. In short just thank you, everyone.",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and grateful tone, indicating the author's appreciation for the support and advice received from others. the mention of helpfulness and friendliness on the internet suggests a sense of community and connection, which are typically associated with positive emotional states. the author acknowledges that they still have challenges to overcome, but the expression of hope and improvement in their well-being, particularly noting that today has been the best day since their struggles began, further indicates a positive shift. these elements, such as gratitude, recognition of support, and a sense of improvement, are not typical indicators of stress but rather of someone who is feeling supported and optimistic."
"They’re out of town. I live in a pretty safe neighborhood, so I left the door unlocked for 30 minutes while I went on a run earlier. I always do that. Now I’m wishing I didn’t. Called two of my friends, but it’s late and they’re asleep.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of anxiety and worry, which are typical indicators of stress. the individual mentions leaving the door unlocked, which is something they usually do without concern. however, the fact that they are now regretting this decision suggests heightened anxiety and second-guessing their usual behavior. the context of calling friends late at night, despite knowing they might be asleep, further underscores their need for reassurance and support. this behavior is consistent with someone experiencing stress, as they are seeking external validation to alleviate their concerns. the combination of regret, worry, and seeking help from friends are all relevant psychological indicators of stress."
"He said he'd be back in the couple hours, never returned. I went down to the bridge spot around 10pm (~3 hours after he expected to return), recognized his bicycle, and left a note with a glowstick taped to it with my address in case he just forgot where exactly I was. Also left word with his next door tent neighbor. It's now been ~17 hours since he left his stuff here, which is obviously important, cell phone, warm coat, etc. I'll swing by the bridge area in a couple hours, but as of last night, his neighbors hadn't seen him since roughly when he left my place to return there before coming back to get his stuff.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual has gone missing, but the tone and details suggest a methodical and calm approach to finding the person. the writer recounts specific actions taken, such as leaving a note with a glowstick and informing the missing person's neighbor, indicating a sense of responsibility and logical problem-solving rather than panic. the mention of the missing items, like a cell phone and warm coat, shows concern, but the writer remains focused on practical steps to address the situation. the overall narrative lacks expressions of overwhelming anxiety or distress, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it reflects a composed and systematic response to an unexpected event."
"Anyway our talk basically went nowhere and she said she absolutely will not stop hanging out with the group. I didn’t tell her to, but I did tell her that it hurts me that she would engage with people who apparently have so many negative things to say about me, and I thought blood was thicker than water. Really it’s her callous “yea I see you’re in pain but I don’t care, get over it” type of standpoint that’s hurting me the most. I’m starting to think she too participates in the trash talking and I’m thinking of cutting her off too. Should I?",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly in the context of interpersonal relationships and emotional distress. the author expresses feelings of hurt and betrayal, which are common stress triggers, especially when involving close relationships. the mention of a conversation that ""went nowhere"" suggests frustration and a lack of resolution, further contributing to stress. the author feels hurt by the friend's perceived indifference to their pain, which exacerbates feelings of isolation and emotional turmoil. the suspicion that the friend may also be engaging in negative talk about the author indicates a heightened sense of distrust and anxiety. the contemplation of cutting off the friend suggests a significant level of distress and a desire to remove a source of emotional pain, which is a common response to stress. these elements collectively highlight the author's experience of stress through emotional hurt, frustration, distrust, and a sense of betrayal."
"For a bit of background, our relationship isn’t perfect. We’re different people. For example, I’m a very liberal individual, feminist at heart, not very sportsy. He however is more moderate, has much older parents and is more moderate in terms of gender roles and very sportsy. Overall though our differences don’t really bother me.",0,"the narrative describes a relationship with notable differences in personal values and interests, yet it emphasizes that these differences do not cause significant concern for the author. the writer acknowledges the contrasts in their liberal and feminist views versus their partner's moderate stance and traditional gender roles. despite these potential points of contention, the author maintains a tone of acceptance and indicates that the differences are not a source of distress. this acceptance and lack of expressed frustration or anxiety suggest a level of comfort and stability in the relationship, which are not typical indicators of stress. the narrative focuses on the coexistence of differing perspectives without highlighting any ongoing conflicts or emotional turmoil, reinforcing a sense of equilibrium rather than stress."
But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now. I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships. I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff. I know he loves me and he is terribly worried. But I also feel bad for me.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as the expression of ongoing trouble and emotional distress related to past trauma. the author mentions feeling sick and tired of how their trauma affects their relationships, which suggests a persistent struggle with unresolved issues. the feeling of guilt towards the boyfriend, who is described as worried and undeserving of dealing with the author's issues, highlights the author's self-critical thoughts and emotional burden. additionally, the acknowledgment of feeling bad for oneself indicates a deep sense of self-awareness and internal conflict. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress and emotional turmoil."
"He brought me to hang out with the two of them a few times. I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about. My best guess is that my ""touchy"" ness comes off as flirting and he thinks I'm trying to take him from her? I do casually say things like ""I love you"" a lot too which just worsens it from that perspective. This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.",1,"the narrative reveals a person grappling with confusion and distress over a misinterpretation of their actions. the individual is anxious about how their behavior is perceived by others, particularly their friend, and is preoccupied with the potential damage to the relationship. the mention of ""still thinking about"" the situation indicates ongoing rumination, a common symptom of stress. the person’s concern about being seen as flirtatious and the horror they feel at the misunderstanding further underscore their emotional turmoil. additionally, the emphasis on valuing the friendship for its non-romantic nature highlights their fear of losing a meaningful connection, which can be a significant source of stress."

Its been a week already since this happened and be hasn't once texted me.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual did not receive a reply to their texts and chose not to go out that night to avoid embarrassment. they later reached out again and still received no response, and it's noted that a week has passed without any communication from the other person. despite the lack of response and the potential for feeling ignored, the narrative does not exhibit clear indicators of stress such as heightened emotional language, expressions of anxiety, or significant distress. the tone remains relatively neutral and factual, focusing more on the sequence of events rather than emotional reactions or psychological turmoil. this suggests that the individual may not be experiencing significant stress from this situation, as their description lacks the intensity and emotional weight typically associated with stress responses."
"For the dog, at least, I can get stuff for cheap dog food or something, but the cat we'd need cat food. All of this weighs on my mind. With my anxiety, I keep going over it in my head again and again. I know I need to see a therapist, but you guessed it, no money. I'm really hoping someone can help out.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly financial strain and anxiety. the mention of the need to budget for pet food highlights ongoing financial concerns, which can be a major stressor. the repeated mental cycle of worrying about these expenses suggests rumination, a common symptom of anxiety. the individual's acknowledgment of needing therapy but being unable to afford it further compounds the stress, illustrating a sense of helplessness and lack of resources. the plea for external assistance underscores the desperation and immediate need for support. these elements collectively paint a picture of a person grappling with considerable stress and anxiety, driven by financial difficulties and the lack of access to mental health care."
"And after every episode with them he treats me like shit for a couple hours at work I assume wondering if I know about his behaviour and if I’ll say anything. I completely ignore it and refuse to let it invade our work environment. It’s my world, and my people, and I’m his superior. He’s not going to win a power struggle, so I don’t even have to worry about it. Other days we get along fine from 9-5.",0,"the narrative describes a work relationship where the individual acknowledges being treated poorly by a subordinate after certain episodes but chooses to ignore it and maintain professionalism. the writer expresses confidence in their position and control over the situation, indicating a strong sense of self-assurance and authority. the mention of not worrying about a power struggle and the ability to get along fine on other days suggests resilience and effective coping mechanisms. these elements point to a balanced approach to handling workplace dynamics without exhibiting signs of stress or emotional distress."
"I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not, and I feel guilty for feeling relieved. We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1,"the narrative reveals significant internal conflict and self-doubt, which are hallmark indicators of stress. the author expresses guilt and confusion about their own behavior, questioning whether they are being toxic and feeling relieved. this ambivalence often accompanies stress, as individuals struggle with their own emotions and actions. the mention of anxiety further supports the presence of stress, as it is a common psychological response to ongoing tension and unresolved issues. the author reflects on a past friendship that deteriorated, attributing blame to themselves and their emotional struggles, which is indicative of a stress response. the use of terms like ""muddied the waters,"" ""emotional abuse crap,"" and ""wanted to get away from the anxiety"" highlights the distress and mental burden they are experiencing. overall, the narrative is characterized by a pervasive sense of guilt, self-blame, and anxiety, all of which are strong indicators of stress."
I didn’t sleep that night and eventually was fine. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer. I’ve had a few mini panic attacks.

I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.,1,"the narrative describes several classic symptoms of stress and anxiety. the individual mentions difficulty sleeping, which is a common issue for those under stress. the escalation of anxiety is evident as they describe how scary movies now have a prolonged impact on their thoughts, indicating heightened sensitivity and persistent worry. the mention of mini panic attacks is a clear sign of acute stress and anxiety. the avoidance of intoxication due to fear of losing control over their mental state reflects a coping mechanism often seen in stressed individuals trying to maintain a sense of stability. the feeling of an overarching darkness and constant fear further highlights the presence of significant stress, as these are typical manifestations of chronic anxiety and emotional distress."
"Typically this involves simply leaving the building inside the dream. If I can find a door and get out, the dream goes away.

I hope this is helpful for some.",0,"the narrative describes a person's experience with dreams and their ability to escape from nightmares by finding a door and leaving the building within the dream. the individual notes that sometimes they wake up after this escape, and sometimes they don't, but they always remember the dream the next morning. the tone of the narrative is reflective and curious, as the person wonders if others have had similar experiences. there is no indication of distress or overwhelming emotions; instead, the focus is on sharing a personal technique and hoping it might be helpful to others. the calm and measured description, along with the absence of anxiety or urgency, suggests that the person is not currently experiencing significant stress."

"A emotional turning point for me was at 16, my dog at the time, a Lovable and super friendly Labrador who was about 3 years, decided to wander out the gate and explore when he drove in after work one evening.

How do I get help?",1,"the narrative indicates a significant level of stress, as the individual describes a troubling and potentially abusive relationship. the person acknowledges their boyfriend's tantrums and destructive behavior, which are clear sources of emotional distress. despite the absence of physical violence, the fear and confusion expressed by the author about whether the behavior constitutes abuse and their plea for help are strong indicators of psychological stress. the reference to being saved from their family suggests a history of dependency and possibly previous trauma, further compounding their current emotional state. the combination of fear, uncertainty, and the need for guidance are all typical signs of someone experiencing significant stress."
"I am moving in with my BF and am fine with doing it 'early' because I love him and want to spend more time with him, I am moving back to my hometown where I have a large safety net, and we are choosing an apartment that he can afford on his own if he needs to. I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic, but both he and I have discussed all of the above, and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry. I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence. But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make. I will still be doing a lot of things on my own, he is also an independent person, and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of calm and confidence about the decision to move in with a partner. the author expresses love and excitement about spending more time together, and there is a notable emphasis on planning and preparedness, which suggests a thoughtful and measured approach rather than impulsive or stress-driven behavior. the presence of a strong support network in the hometown and the financial independence of both individuals further contribute to a sense of security and stability. the author also mentions their past experiences with maintaining independence in relationships, which indicates a self-awareness and comfort with their personal boundaries. the overall tone is positive and forward-looking, highlighting mutual respect and understanding in the relationship."
"I want to note that I told my husband that if he came to me and told me for his sanity he needed to leave, I'd do it even if it was dumb for us monetarily. Nothing is worth him being tortured and putting pressure on our marriage. I think the reason we get by is because sometimes we can get away with once a day torture from my mother, she also helps us a lot (especially me) and some days are ok. He just feels harassed and I understand this more than anyone because I feel the same way. .",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through its depiction of ongoing emotional and relational turmoil. the individual expresses a willingness to make substantial sacrifices for the well-being of their spouse, indicating a high level of distress and concern for their partner's mental health. phrases like ""tortured"" and ""pressure on our marriage"" suggest a persistent and intense strain within their relationship, exacerbated by the presence of the narrator's mother. the mention of ""once a day torture"" underscores the chronic nature of their stress, while the acknowledgment that some days are ""ok"" implies that relief is sporadic and insufficient. the shared feeling of harassment between the narrator and their husband further highlights a mutual and pervasive sense of being overwhelmed. these elements collectively point to a stressful environment marked by emotional exhaustion and strained interpersonal dynamics."
"I hide my own set of keys. She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse, which turns into a full-blown fight. I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails. At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand. I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1,"the narrative details a highly intense and violent altercation, which is a clear indicator of significant stress. the physical description of marks, bruises, and scratches, as well as the specific mention of having one's head repeatedly slammed into a wall, demonstrates the severe physical toll of the conflict. the mention of being cornered and the desperate struggle over the keys indicates a situation fraught with fear and anxiety. the defensive nature of the narrator's actions, coupled with the overall chaotic and aggressive environment, further underscores the presence of acute stress. these elements collectively illustrate the psychological strain and emotional turmoil experienced by the individual."
"Bit of background... My abuser was my mother's father, let's call him J, because he doesn't deserve the title Grandpa. My mother's mother was H, because she didn't like us kids and doesn't deserve the title grandma. Between 1987 and 1989, I would stay at J's house for up to a week at a time and every night he would come into the room to abuse me. It always centered on sexual humiliation.",0,"the narrative describes a traumatic and abusive experience during the author's childhood, involving severe sexual abuse by a family member. the detailed recounting of these events, including the specific time frame and the explicit mention of sexual humiliation, typically points to deep emotional and psychological scars. however, the narrative does not provide current emotional responses or behaviors that would indicate ongoing stress. it focuses on past events without discussing present feelings or coping mechanisms, which might suggest that the individual has processed or compartmentalized these experiences to some extent. while the content is undoubtedly distressing, the absence of present-focused stress indicators such as anxiety, depression, or avoidance behavior in the narrative may explain why it is not classified as a current stress experience."
"[Alice <url> was raising hell about it in Europe in the '70s... and here in the '80s. But in those days, the only gasoline being poured on the fire were drugs and alcohol. Things have changed. Now we have machine guns anyone can get in a day if they know where to look. And unless or until this society gets up off its politesse and deals with its descent back into decivilization... deals with the epidemic fucking, battering and *psychotizing* of children... deals with mind-altering chemicals *everywhere*... deals with ""our right"" to own *machine* guns... what should we expect?",0,"the narrative reflects a critical and intense perspective on societal issues, highlighting concerns about violence, substance abuse, and the decline of societal values. while the language is strong and passionate, it lacks personal references to the author's own emotional state or experiences. the focus is on broader societal problems rather than individual stressors. the absence of personal anecdotes, feelings of overwhelm, or direct references to personal stress suggests that the narrative is more about societal critique than an expression of personal distress. this indicates a level of detachment from the issues discussed, which is not typical of someone experiencing significant personal stress."
"The thought of leaving my folks behind would definitely not be good for me mentally. I've thought about basically living out of my car, gym memberships to shower daily and laundromats to wash my clothes. Perhaps put all my stuff in storage and just keep working and save some money up. I live on long Island btw. Rent isn't cheap.",1,"the narrative reflects significant signs of stress. the individual expresses anxiety about leaving their family, which suggests a deep emotional attachment and concern for their well-being. the contemplation of extreme measures such as living out of a car, using gym memberships for daily hygiene, and laundromats for clothing care indicates a sense of desperation and lack of stable housing, which are strong stress indicators. the mention of storing belongings and focusing solely on work to save money highlights financial strain and an uncertain future. living on long island, where rent is high, adds to the pressure and exacerbates the individual's stress. overall, the narrative is filled with elements of worry, instability, and financial hardship, all of which are typical indicators of stress."
"Which forced me to acknowledge that I haven’t been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack. Sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling.

I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.",1,"the narrative reflects a clear indication of stress through several explicit signs. the author mentions experiencing an anxiety attack, which is a significant indicator of stress. the symptoms described, such as sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling, are all physical and emotional manifestations commonly associated with high levels of stress and anxiety. the mention of throwing away xanax, a medication often prescribed for anxiety, and later regretting it, suggests a struggle with managing anxiety and stress. this indicates an ongoing battle with stress that the individual thought was resolved but has resurfaced. the acknowledgment of not meeting personal expectations adds to the emotional burden, further supporting the presence of stress. these elements collectively point to a narrative deeply intertwined with stress-related experiences."
"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I’m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such. Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off. Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.",1,"the narrative describes a person who maintains a routine that includes taking care of their dog, keeping their living space clean, doing laundry, eating well, working out, and socializing with friends. despite these productive activities, the individual mentions feeling a persistent weight on their shoulders, suggesting a sense of inadequacy or the belief that they should be doing more. the feeling of being too tired to engage in additional activities, even after cutting out video games, indicates an underlying fatigue and possible burnout. this combination of maintaining a busy schedule while experiencing a constant sense of pressure and exhaustion are common indicators of stress. the mention of feeling burdened despite accomplishing many tasks highlights a psychological struggle with self-expectations and possibly perfectionism, both of which are relevant in the context of stress."

Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right? You need to do your school work”. My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes a pattern of negative interactions despite their efforts to be kind and supportive. their attempts to compliment and care for their family members are met with harsh criticism and verbal abuse, such as being told they will fail and being called naive and immature. these repeated negative responses from close family members can lead to feelings of worthlessness, frustration, and helplessness. the person's acknowledgment of being a ""verbal punching bag"" suggests a chronic exposure to stressors that are emotionally draining. the inconsistency between their positive actions and the negative feedback they receive is a significant source of stress, contributing to a sense of emotional exhaustion and strained familial relationships."
"Please don't make me feel worse. I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend. But at least we have things to talk about and he's just naturally good at keeping me calm without even realizing he's doing it. He actually *helps* by being there. My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.",1,"the narrative reflects a person experiencing stress, as indicated by their explicit plea not to feel worse and their sense of shame in needing support. the individual acknowledges their reliance on their boyfriend for emotional stability, highlighting his calming influence as a significant source of relief. this reliance suggests a heightened state of vulnerability and the need for external support to manage their stress. the mention of their mom and sister either doing nothing or exacerbating the situation further underscores the individual's struggle with their current emotional state. these elements collectively point to a person dealing with stress, relying on specific relationships to cope, and feeling let down by others who fail to provide the needed support."
"I apologised and thought that was the end of it. It’s gotten to the point that if I walk into a room, she’ll leave straight away, and if she doesn’t leave, or if I start talking to her or someone else, she sighs a lot so I know my presence is not wanted. If I’m in her general direction of travel, she’ll be sure to make a wide berth around me, and the only time she’s spoken a full sentence to me was to say “thanks for my present” that I got her for Christmas. Then we get to tonight. Eva and one of my brothers are staying over at our cousins house.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving interpersonal conflict and social tension. the author recounts an experience of apologizing and expecting resolution, but instead faces avoidance and passive-aggressive behavior from another individual. while these interactions are certainly unpleasant and may cause discomfort, the narrative lacks key indicators of significant stress. there is no mention of overwhelming anxiety, physical symptoms, or pervasive feelings of hopelessness or despair. the author seems to observe and report the behavior rather than internalizing it to a degree that would suggest a high level of stress. the focus remains on external actions and reactions rather than an intense internal struggle."

She needs both a short-term plan to do minimal damage to her current career and academics, as well as a long term one to find an apartment or suitable living space. At this time, I do not believe she has any existent options for roommates. 1) What resources can she call upon to help her?",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation involving familial conflict and immediate logistical concerns. despite the difficulties, there is no explicit indication of emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety. the focus is on practical steps and planning, such as finding housing and maintaining career and academic progress. the tone is solution-oriented rather than expressing feelings of hopelessness, fear, or panic. the inquiry about resources suggests a proactive approach rather than a reaction driven by stress. overall, the narrative lacks typical indicators of stress such as expressions of emotional turmoil, cognitive overload, or physiological symptoms."
"1. My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14, maybe earlier. I don't really remember what all brought this on, but often it was school related.

He'd do it because of grades, because i misbehaved.",1,"the narrative describes a prolonged period of abuse, both mental and physical, which is a significant source of stress. the individual recounts specific instances of trauma, such as hyperventilating from crying, which indicates a high level of emotional distress. the mention of school-related triggers for the abuse and the fear of being taken to the father highlight ongoing anxiety and fear. the inability to recall the exact onset of the abuse suggests that it was a pervasive part of their childhood, further contributing to chronic stress. the description of the mother feeling helpless and the promise to never put the child in that situation again underscores the lack of a stable support system, exacerbating the sense of vulnerability and stress."
I'll have written a letter to give to her. The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well. I don't know how to word my reasons to break up though. Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance. Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?,0,"the narrative reflects a careful and thoughtful approach to a sensitive situation, which is indicative of someone who is not experiencing significant stress. the individual is planning ahead by writing a letter to ensure clear communication, showing a level of organization and forethought. their concern about potential misunderstandings and their desire to communicate effectively suggest a measured and considerate mindset. while the topic of breaking up can be emotionally charged, the person's focus on finding the right words and considering the other person's feelings indicates a balanced and composed state of mind. these aspects, such as planning, careful communication, and consideration for the other's emotions, are not typically associated with high levels of stress."

"Here's a homebaked metaphor. This is only a reflection of my personal views, and is not designed to reflect anybody else's experience. ----- Just as witches and wizards in the novels avoid mentioning Voldemort's name, those who have experienced a trauma tend to avoid remembering it, thinking about it, speaking about it, anything that triggers the awful feelings and sensations which a traumatic event conditions us to associate with it. We go to great lengths to avoid doing or saying anything which will activate the trauma.",0,"the narrative employs a metaphor to discuss how individuals handle trauma, drawing a parallel to the avoidance of voldemort's name in novels. while the subject matter is serious and revolves around the concept of trauma, the tone and context suggest an analytical perspective rather than a personal, emotionally charged one. the author explicitly states that the views are personal and not reflective of others' experiences, indicating a level of detachment. the language used is measured and intellectual, focusing on the behavior associated with trauma rather than expressing immediate distress or emotional turmoil. the narrative's objective discussion and lack of emotive language are typical indicators of a non-stressed state."

That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone.

"I used my forearm to push the plate I was eating from off the counter. A glass bowl fell to the floor as well and shattered. The noise woke my dad up, who went to bed nearly black out drunk a couple hours before this. He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door. He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.",1,"the narrative depicts a highly distressing and chaotic situation involving physical aggression and verbal abuse. the individual describes an incident where an accidental action leads to significant conflict. the presence of a drunk and aggressive parent exacerbates the situation, resulting in physical manhandling and expulsion from the home. the sudden and violent response, coupled with the use of profanity and force, creates an environment of fear and instability. these elements are strong indicators of stress, as the individual is subjected to both emotional and physical turmoil. the reaction of the friends, offering support and an escape, further underscores the gravity of the situation and the stress experienced by the narrator."
Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that. I wish so badly I knew who she was so that I could tell her in quiet that if she ever needs a place to escape that my door is always open. Sorry for my rambling. I'm just not sure what to do or how to approach this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.,1,"the narrative reflects significant concern and distress over a situation involving someone living in fear of another person's unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. the writer expresses a strong desire to help, indicating a sense of urgency and helplessness. phrases like ""put up with that,"" ""live in fear,"" and ""fly off the handle"" suggest an environment of instability and anxiety. the apology for rambling and the admission of uncertainty about how to approach the situation further indicate a high level of stress. the plea for help underscores the writer's emotional turmoil and need for guidance, which are common indicators of stress."

And I'm so tired of it. I've been in therapy for half of my life. I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough. So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the author's description of their struggles with trauma, ptsd, and dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization. the mention of being tired of these experiences suggests a sense of exhaustion and frustration. despite engaging in therapeutic activities like writing and listening to music, the author expresses that these efforts feel insufficient, which can indicate a feeling of helplessness or ongoing distress. the admission of talking to oneself under stress and turning to drinking further highlights maladaptive coping mechanisms often associated with high stress levels. these behaviors and feelings are consistent with someone experiencing significant psychological strain."
"I didn't phone a crisis line again, it was daylight by this point so I phoned the therapist. She talked me down for an hour, and got me to agree to go into my social workers office since I still couldn't calm down. She gave me a free appointment the next day. But when I went to it, though sympathetic, she made it clear I had to commit to stop drinking if we were going to get any meaningful work done. She said she wouldn't abandon me, she would sit with me, but that she couldn't ""be"" with me, affected as I was by the alcohol.",0,"the narrative describes a series of interactions with mental health professionals and the individual's commitment to seeking help, which are positive indicators of proactive coping mechanisms. the person reached out to a therapist instead of a crisis line, showing an ability to seek appropriate resources. the therapist's response was supportive and structured, emphasizing the need for sobriety to make progress. despite the challenges mentioned, such as difficulty calming down and the need to stop drinking, the narrative reflects a level of engagement and willingness to follow through with professional advice. these actions and attitudes suggest resilience and a constructive approach to managing difficulties, which are not typically consistent with high stress levels. the narrative's tone, though serious, does not convey overwhelming distress or hopelessness, further supporting the classification."

I told him I'd be going to the police.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with a logistical issue involving movers and a refund. while the person is clearly frustrated and taking steps to resolve the issue, the tone and content do not indicate significant emotional distress or psychological strain. the individual is methodically addressing the problem by contacting the movers, setting deadlines, and following through with their intentions to involve the police if necessary. this approach suggests a level of control and assertiveness rather than stress. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, physical symptoms, or cognitive disruptions that are typical indicators of stress. instead, the narrative reflects a rational and organized response to an inconvenient but manageable situation."
"The only way to really settle disputes is to listen carefully to what is being said.

I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now, and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I don’t want to make it bad. I don’t know what to do. So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I don’t know why I’m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself. It’s just I want to be better, not just for other people but for myself too.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional turmoil and self-doubt, which are clear indicators of stress. the individual expresses feelings of loneliness and longing for a meaningful friendship, highlighting a sense of loss and yearning. the mention of wanting to have a good weekend but feeling it is impossible points to anticipatory anxiety. the narrative also includes self-critical thoughts, such as feeling selfish and believing that others hate them, which are common in individuals experiencing stress. the desire to isolate oneself and the acknowledgment of overthinking further illustrate a heightened state of stress. overall, the narrative captures a complex mix of sadness, anxiety, and self-criticism, all of which are relevant indicators of stress."

Well, did it cause when we were long distance he wouldn’t initiate calling (I know Joe too well to know this is just unnatural for him), holding my hand more than he does, coming home and giving me a kiss, honestly he has a faster pace and I even equated him sometimes not walking at my pace as him not caring. What has Joe actually done to show me he cares? He puts up with my rage and abuse, he helps with my mother (who is nuts herself, so I guess I take after her), he has offered financial help if I need it (doing MSc).",0,"the narrative describes a series of personal interactions and emotional responses that suggest frustration and anger towards joe. the writer acknowledges their own intense reactions, such as going ""fully zuko fire bender mode"" and unleashing wrath on joe for various reasons. despite these outbursts, the narrative also highlights joe's supportive actions, like helping with the writer's mother and offering financial assistance. these supportive behaviors from joe might indicate a stable relationship where the writer feels secure enough to express their frustrations. the narrative reflects a mix of emotional intensity and stability, with the writer recognizing their own tendencies and joe's consistent support, which may suggest a balanced emotional state rather than one dominated by stress."

But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of fear and discomfort, highlighting a traumatic experience where the individual felt physically threatened. the repetition of the same feelings from a previous distressing event indicates ongoing emotional turmoil and unresolved trauma. the mention of holding on to a ""stupid fucking thread of hope"" despite recognizing the need to leave suggests a deep internal conflict and an attachment to an unrealistic expectation of change. this internal struggle, combined with the acknowledgment of the danger but inability to act on it, are clear indicators of stress. the narrative's emotional intensity and the presence of both fear and hope point to a state of significant psychological distress."

I just went through major jaw surgery (I replaced the TMJ joint disk with a fat graft) and my mouth is now wired shut for the next 9 months. To fill the time I would have spent talking, eating, and generally having a good time, I have instead been studying for all the standardized tests I need to go to a good college. I studied at least 4 hours a day and put a strain on my recovery (this is because my upper body muscles were strained which affects my jaw and subsequently my new disk). Luckily, my hard work payed off.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has undergone significant jaw surgery and is now facing a prolonged recovery period with their mouth wired shut. despite this challenging situation, the person has redirected their focus towards studying for standardized tests required for college admission. the dedication to studying for at least 4 hours a day, even at the expense of physical strain, indicates a strong sense of determination and goal orientation. the individual acknowledges the strain on their recovery but ultimately expresses satisfaction with the outcome of their hard work. this reflects resilience and a positive outlook, as they are able to find a silver lining in a difficult situation. there is no mention of overwhelming feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or inability to cope, which are more typical indicators of stress. instead, the narrative highlights perseverance and a constructive approach to dealing with adversity."

She said ""This is wrong"" several times but never got up and left.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual experiences discomfort and an invasion of personal boundaries in a professional setting. the person being described seems to exhibit a passive response to the inappropriate advances, indicating discomfort and moral conflict. however, the lack of explicit signs of stress, such as physiological symptoms, emotional outbursts, or significant changes in behavior, suggests that the individual may not be experiencing high levels of stress. the narrative focuses on the person's reactions and actions rather than on internal states or stress-related symptoms. her acknowledgment of discomfort and recognition of the situation's inappropriateness without further emotional escalation or significant distress indicators align with the classification."

"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1,"the narrative depicts a scenario filled with deception, confusion, and emotional turmoil. the individual recounts an incident where someone they care about lied to another person about their whereabouts, which resulted in a complex mix of emotions and reactions. the use of phrases like ""royally freaked out"" suggests a heightened state of anxiety and stress. the need to rationalize and understand the situation by piecing together various elements of the story, such as the girl's explanation and the partner's fabricated excuse, indicates a significant mental and emotional strain. the overall tone of the narrative reflects a struggle to make sense of conflicting information and manage the stress of potential betrayal, which are clear indicators of a stressed state of mind."

My second sister is reckless, spends money she doesn’t have, constantly lies and irresponsible.",0,"the narrative describes a highly dysfunctional family dynamic, where the individual recounts various toxic behaviors from family members. the mother and older sister use guilt as a manipulation tactic, and the mother frequently expresses feelings of neglect. the older sister makes alarming statements about her own worth, suggesting a desire to escape her situation. the second sister is depicted as irresponsible and deceitful. while these descriptions highlight significant family issues, the narrative itself does not indicate that the individual is currently experiencing stress. there is no mention of personal emotional responses, coping difficulties, or stress-related symptoms. instead, the focus is on the behaviors of others rather than the narrator's internal state."

And she says that he saw her and stopped walking towards me (13) my mom did ask me if anything happened on the way to school",0,"the narrative describes a series of unsettling events involving inappropriate behavior by parental figures. despite the disturbing nature of the content, the narrative does not explicitly convey signs of acute stress in the author's tone or choice of words. there is a recounting of past events without a clear indication of current emotional distress or anxiety. the author seems to provide a detached recount of incidents rather than expressing ongoing turmoil or stress. the lack of emotive language and absence of immediate psychological or physiological reactions suggest that the author is not currently experiencing stress related to these events. instead, they appear to be reflecting on past experiences with a degree of emotional distance."

"The last Sticky thread before this one: <url> There is all kinds of things that friends or therapists say which has helped us, what helps for one person doesn't help for another, but I think it may be helpful if people share what has helped them here.

"Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me. I was on the treadmill every night for 45 minutes. I was doing good. Now I can't be on the treadmill or I start feeling ill again. Anyway, after the garbage issue I ended up in the hospital again.",1,"the narrative indicates significant stress through several key aspects. firstly, the individual describes a change in routine, particularly in their exercise habits, which is often a coping mechanism for stress. the shift from feeling good while on the treadmill to feeling ill suggests a physical manifestation of stress. additionally, the mention of a ""garbage issue"" leading to hospitalization highlights an external stressor that had a substantial impact on their health. the combination of these elements - disruption in routine, physical symptoms, and hospitalization due to an external event - are typical indicators of stress. these factors collectively point towards the individual experiencing a high level of stress."

I have not gone on an SSRI yet, however I am planning to do so ASAP.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators that are commonly associated with experiencing stress. the individual mentions persistent symptoms that are troubling enough to seek medical advice from two different doctors, which suggests a significant level of concern and preoccupation. the fact that the symptoms are always occurring, even if they sometimes do not bother the person, indicates a constant underlying issue. the doctors' suggestion that the symptoms are related to anxiety and the recommendation to start an ssri (a type of medication often prescribed for anxiety and depression) further supports the presence of ongoing stress. the individual's acknowledgment of planning to start the medication ""asap"" reflects an urgency to address their condition, highlighting the impact of these symptoms on their daily life. these elements collectively point to a narrative characterized by stress and anxiety."

I’ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and he’s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes. I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together. I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1,"the narrative describes a series of highly distressing and traumatic experiences, including harassment, threats, psychological abuse, and sexual assault. the individual recounts ongoing victimization, including attempts to extort friendship, exposure to traumatic figures during legal proceedings, and manipulation of mutual acquaintances. these events are described with a sense of ongoing fear and the need for repeated relocations to ensure safety. such experiences are potent stressors, contributing to a state of heightened anxiety, trauma, and ongoing psychological distress. the specific details of harassment, abuse, and the need for constant vigilance are clear indicators of significant stress."
"I (30F) married my husband (31M) about 6 months ago after dating for 2 years and knowing each other for about 14. When we first hooked up, I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job. He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew. He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless. However, He has been very abusive, always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress stemming from the author's relationship dynamics. the individual recounts a history of emotional abuse from their spouse, who uses their past career in the adult industry as a weapon during conflicts. despite initial acceptance, the husband's behavior has become increasingly hostile and accusatory, creating a toxic environment. this ongoing emotional manipulation and lack of support are classic stressors that can lead to feelings of insecurity, worthlessness, and heightened anxiety. the chronic nature of these abusive interactions likely exacerbates the individual's stress levels, as they are constantly subjected to blame and derogatory remarks about their past, undermining their sense of self-worth and stability within the marriage."
"I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of distress and trauma. the individual describes a history of severe abuse from their father, including physical violence and emotional manipulation, which are strong indicators of long-term psychological stress. the mention of fearing that their father knows they talk about him suggests ongoing anxiety and hypervigilance, common in those with traumatic pasts. the fact that they almost died twice due to their father's actions points to life-threatening situations that likely contribute to chronic stress. despite years passing since the last visit, the individual still experiences profound emotional distress, such as sobbing in bed and pervasive fear of others, which are symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the narrative is filled with expressions of unresolved trauma and persistent fear, clearly illustrating the deep and lasting impact of their past experiences."
"I’m trying to tell myself it’s like being beat up on the street by a stranger - it’s only once, but it still happened and it’s traumatic. 2) Related to the above. It WASN’T a stranger. It was someone I loved and trusted and I can’t believe he could have done this. He never treated me right, not truly (except maybe in the very beginning), but I never even saw this as a possibility.",1,"the narrative reveals significant emotional turmoil and distress. the individual describes a traumatic experience, comparing it to being physically assaulted, which underscores the severity of their emotional pain. the fact that the perpetrator was someone they loved and trusted amplifies the betrayal and shock, common indicators of intense stress. the narrative also highlights a pattern of mistreatment and a sense of disbelief, reflecting the psychological impact of being hurt by a close person. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is grappling with deep emotional wounds, typical of someone experiencing stress."
"He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent. Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",1,"the narrative describes a harrowing experience of physical and emotional abuse, indicative of significant stress. the repeated instances of violence, such as being forced into sex, slammed into the wall and table, and kicked until experiencing a panic attack, highlight severe trauma. the constant fear and hypervigilance, evidenced by waiting for the abuser to pass out and running from him as he chased with a knife, reflect chronic stress. the environment described, including the cold nights spent hiding and the threat of dangerous animals, further exacerbates the sense of relentless danger and helplessness. the involvement of the rescue dog, who also endured abuse, underscores a shared experience of trauma and the desperate attempts to find safety. these elements collectively illustrate a life dominated by acute stress and terror, making the psychological distress evident."
"So I guess I'll jump right in. I have PTSD, and have for about 15 years with varying degrees of symptom severity after a sexual assault. Right now my symptoms are pretty well controlled and I am in regular therapy. Largely I am only dealing with nightmares and a heightened startle response and doing really well overall. In the last year I started dating an amazing man.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is currently managing their ptsd symptoms effectively. despite the history of trauma and ongoing symptoms like nightmares and a heightened startle response, the individual describes their condition as well controlled and mentions being in regular therapy. this suggests a stable and proactive approach to mental health. the positive tone when discussing their relationship with an amazing man further indicates emotional stability and satisfaction in their personal life. these factors collectively point towards a well-managed condition rather than acute stress."

I walked down the street to some friends house he introduced me too. Been here 2 Weeks. They are alcoholics.,0,"the narrative describes a series of unfortunate events and challenging circumstances, such as being kicked out of a house and living with friends who are alcoholics. however, the tone and presentation of the events do not convey a significant level of emotional distress or anxiety typically associated with stress. the individual recounts the events in a straightforward manner without expressing feelings of being overwhelmed, hopelessness, or significant worry. there is a sense of acceptance and adaptation to the situation rather than signs of mental or emotional strain. this suggests that while the circumstances are difficult, the individual is not currently experiencing high levels of stress."

Her LVN attends to her physical and health needs everywhere that she goes during the day at home, in her college classes, out in the community, and her volunteering sites. She had good luck with LVNs, but her last LVN unfortunately no longer has worked with her since December. Since November, her family has posted the job opening six times online, asked all the local Vocational Nursing schools to post the job, and countless people posted the job opening on social media. No one applied for the enjoyable position, except for one, but she lasted for four hours and she decided that she didn't want the job after all.",0,"the narrative describes a well-organized support system for an individual with significant health needs. the detailed account of the mother’s role as a primary caregiver and the use of licensed vocational nurses (lvns) to ensure continuity of care demonstrates a proactive approach to managing daily living activities and health needs. the narrative also reflects a structured and persistent effort by the family to find a replacement lvn, indicating a sense of resilience and resourcefulness. despite the recent difficulty in finding a suitable lvn, the tone remains focused on practical solutions rather than expressing distress or hopelessness. this focus on problem-solving and the absence of emotional language typically associated with stress, such as expressions of overwhelm, anxiety, or despair, suggests that the individual and their family are managing the situation with a level of composure and determination. the narrative's emphasis on the positive aspects of previous experiences with lvns and the structured approach to recruitment further supports this perspective."

If I can I will ask ny step mom tonight as we like to watch TV at night diwn stairs with a cuo of tea but thats if she doesn't go to bed straight away. I know I'm too scared and will just freeze up to ask her to stay down. I want to tell my step mom because I know she will tell my dad, I wouldn't be able to tell anyone else accept for my nan.

"Eddie can think back to being 10 at the farthest. I can access very little memories of us being younger than 10, but it's few and far between. Our therapist asked us collectively to try and ask our brother what our childhood was like growing up. I feel like we cannot...do that. We aren't exactly close to Eddie's brother as much as he wants to be, so asking this kind of serious stuff could result in nothing being figured out.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of detachment and distance from past memories, but it does not exhibit clear indicators of stress. the writer acknowledges the difficulty in recalling early childhood memories and mentions the therapist's suggestion to seek information from eddie's brother. however, the hesitation to approach the brother is framed more as a matter of relational distance rather than an acute stress reaction. the tone remains relatively calm and matter-of-fact, lacking signs of emotional distress or anxiety that are often present in stressed individuals. the narrative does not include expressions of overwhelming worry, panic, or other psychological symptoms typically associated with stress. instead, it focuses on the practical challenges of memory retrieval and family dynamics without delving into intense emotional turmoil."

TLDR: I want to apologize on facebook for not being normal and being awkward AF.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who has made significant progress in their mental health journey, as evidenced by their decision to quit antidepressants due to feeling stable. this suggests a level of self-awareness and confidence in their current state. while they acknowledge the presence of difficult thoughts, their ability to recognize and articulate these feelings without being overwhelmed is indicative of effective coping mechanisms. the desire to apologize on facebook for perceived social awkwardness may stem from a heightened self-consciousness rather than acute stress. overall, the narrative lacks the intensity and pervasive negative emotions typically associated with high stress levels."
"Itʻs at the point where I am scared I canʻt focus on driving and will crash or just space out going 45 mph. In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)"" where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canʻt breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events. I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep. I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, evident through the description of fear and difficulty concentrating while driving, which suggests a heightened state of anxiety. the mention of experiencing three major panic attacks, characterized by physical symptoms such as pins and needles sensations and difficulty breathing, points to severe stress responses triggered by emotional events. the reference to recurrent nightmares about dying and the afterlife during childhood, along with the need for maternal comfort to fall asleep, indicates early experiences of distress. the individual's reluctance to self-diagnose despite acknowledging these intense symptoms further underscores their struggle with recognizing and validating their own stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with considerable stress and anxiety, affecting both their past and present well-being."
"It is the winter and Tyler and I have been going out ice fishing a lot, it’s nice because I get to spend time with him and it’s something we both like to do. Well, once Zack found out, he tells Tyler all the time how they should go, etc. Well, Tyler fills up his truck (it is never under $120), fills up the four-wheeler ($60), and Zack walks over to our house with nothing but a helmet. He has absolutely no ice fishing gear, but knows Tyler does and, again, uses Tyler under the guise of “friendship” so he can go. AKA, I don’t get to go anymore.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the speaker enjoys ice fishing with tyler during the winter. they appreciate the activity because it allows them to spend quality time together. however, the speaker expresses some frustration about zack's involvement. zack frequently suggests to tyler that they should go ice fishing, which leads to tyler bearing the financial burden of the trips, such as filling up the truck and four-wheeler. zack, on the other hand, contributes minimally, showing up only with a helmet and relying on tyler's gear. the speaker's main grievance is that zack's presence has resulted in them no longer being able to participate in the ice fishing outings. despite the annoyance and disappointment conveyed, the narrative lacks significant indicators of acute stress. the speaker's tone is more one of irritation and frustration rather than overwhelming stress or anxiety. there is no mention of physical symptoms, severe emotional distress, or significant disruption to daily functioning, which are often key indicators of stress."
"And they all make it sound like I will have infinity free time and money to go exploring all over where I'm going, like I'm going on a damn vacation. I'll still be spending all my free time job hunting. If they want me to come right back to a shithole that doesn't want to hire me because I'm supposedly overqualified just by existing (I keep getting rejections telling me I'm overqualified except for the one that asked me to fill out yet another application despite me handing them one two weeks ago), maybe they can pay my way and then they can pay for all the months that I don't have income. I have come back here too many times already to nothing, and they seem to think I'm just hanging around having fun living in my car. Unbelievable.",1,"the narrative reveals significant frustration and a sense of being misunderstood by others. the individual expresses irritation at the misconception that they have ample free time and resources, highlighting a stark contrast with their reality of job hunting and financial instability. phrases like ""damn vacation,"" ""spending all my free time job hunting,"" and ""overqualified just by existing"" underscore feelings of resentment and helplessness. the mention of repetitive rejections and the financial strain of living in their car further illustrate the chronic stress and pressure they are under. the narrative's tone and content are typical indicators of stress, characterized by anger, hopelessness, and a lack of support or understanding from their social environment."

They represent polar opposites on the spectrum of how cancer survivors can view the world: one feeling positive about having survived so much, the other being angry with the world that it happened in the first place. That's neither here nor there. I'll stop for a moment to explain that I'm not one of those that feels PTSD isn't a real condition. I grew up in an abusive home for years, and it wasn't until my mid 20's that I began come to terms with how subtly that had affected me over the years.",0,"the narrative describes the experiences of two cancer survivors, highlighting their contrasting perspectives on life after overcoming significant health challenges. despite the serious subject matter, the tone of the narrative is observational rather than personal or emotional. the author discusses ptsd and developmental issues with a degree of detachment, providing context rather than expressing personal distress. even when sharing their own history of growing up in an abusive home, the author maintains a reflective and composed tone, indicating a level of acceptance and understanding of their past rather than current emotional turmoil. these elements suggest a state of coping and resilience rather than active stress."
"So, I used tap water in a neti pot. My cold seemed to get worse right after. I googled, “Can a neti pot make a cold worse?” Suddenly, information appears that if you use tap water in a neti pot you can get that brain eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri... (the same one that kills kids who swim in fresh water). I guess two people in Louisiana died from it via tap water\neti pots a few years back.",0,"the narrative describes an individual's experience with using a neti pot and subsequent concerns about potential health risks. the person recounts a specific incident where they used tap water in the neti pot and noticed their cold worsening. they then searched online and discovered alarming information about the dangers of using tap water in neti pots, specifically the risk of contracting naegleria fowleri. despite the potentially frightening information, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of stress. the tone is more informational and reflective rather than anxious or distressed. there is no mention of persistent worry, physical symptoms of stress, or significant emotional distress. the individual presents the facts and their reaction in a calm and composed manner, suggesting a rational and measured response to the situation."

At this time I called my brother, sobbing, and told him to get my mom.",1,"the narrative depicts a state of intense anxiety and existential dread, which are common indicators of stress. the writer expresses a profound sense of unreality and questions the very nature of existence, which suggests a detachment from reality often seen in high-stress situations. the physical reaction of grabbing the couch in an attempt to ground oneself, followed by the internal voice questioning the reality of the couch and the house, highlights the struggle to find stability and reassurance. the escalation to calling a family member while sobbing further emphasizes the overwhelming emotional distress and the urgent need for support. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of stress."

I just want to get this done as food and everything like those necessities is taken care of, but I don't have the funds to get this done before the 7th. If you can help, it would be appreciated so much! Thank you for your help and consideration!

I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1,"the narrative reflects a person grappling with internal conflict and emotional distress, which are typical indicators of stress. the mention of assuming they have ptsd suggests a significant level of anxiety and self-diagnosis, often associated with heightened stress. the hesitation to seek help and feelings of being pathetic, despite being physically fine, indicate a struggle with self-worth and a potential fear of vulnerability. this internal debate and the difficulty in brushing off their feelings highlight an ongoing emotional turmoil. the need for advice and the admission of struggling to understand their emotions further underscore the presence of stress, as they are unable to manage or make sense of their current state."
"Back ground, me and my girl have been homeless independently for about a year and we've been together for six months now. We lived in Olympia Washington for a while and where trying to make it and eventually move out of the toxic town. I received about 3.5k$ worth of back pay EFC payments the state owed me and shortly after my girl's grandmother died and she wanted to make it to the funeral so we decided to make a road trip of it, get jobs in florida and be set. We figured the lower cost of living would offset the vastly lower minimum wage and we'd be fine. We both got jobs at her old workplace (Wendy's, never go to the Lakeland Highlands Wendy's so many healthcode violations btw) and worked for two months and got fired for bs reasons (I got trained wrong and wasn't told about 60% of my responsibilities by a guy who was on his phone 75% of the time and quit a week later, she overslept and no call no showed one day and got immediately taken off the schedule)",1,"the narrative reveals multiple indicators of stress. the chronic instability of homelessness and the struggle to find a stable living situation contribute significantly to stress levels. the death of a loved one, in this case, the girlfriend's grandmother, adds emotional strain and grief. the decision to relocate to florida in hopes of better opportunities demonstrates a search for stability and improvement, but the subsequent job losses at wendy's due to unfair circumstances further exacerbate feelings of helplessness and frustration. the mention of health code violations at the workplace also hints at an environment that is not conducive to well-being. overall, the combination of financial instability, grief, job insecurity, and an unsupportive work environment are classic indicators of stress in this narrative."

So this time, I donated ten pounds to this guy sitting outside of a supermarket.",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and generous experience rather than signs of stress. the individual describes receiving a small financial bonus and deciding to use part of it to help someone in need. this act of kindness, along with the expression of feeling guilty about not donating in the past, indicates a level of empathy and social awareness. while the mention of living on government benefits and in supported accommodation could suggest potential stressors, the overall tone of the narrative is not indicative of acute stress. the focus is on the action of giving and the positive feelings associated with it, which are not typical indicators of stress. instead, they suggest a moment of personal growth and satisfaction."
"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident. This new person I'm dating has never done anything wrong, but I had a thought of what they would look like holding a knife. It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head. I don't want the event from my previous relationship to have an impact on the potential of this new one. Does anyone have any advice for breaking free from this sort of thing?",1,"the narrative indicates the presence of stress through several key elements. the individual recounts an intrusive thought about a knife incident that led to a severe panic attack, a hallmark symptom of acute stress or anxiety. the reference to a past traumatic event and its lingering impact on their current relationship suggests unresolved emotional distress. the need to physically leave the workspace to manage the panic attack further underscores the intensity of their stress response. additionally, the plea for advice on how to overcome these thoughts highlights their struggle with coping mechanisms and the ongoing impact of past trauma on their mental health. these aspects collectively point to a significant level of stress affecting the individual."

He keeps saying things like, this is all your fault and no one is making you think these things. And to be patient with things.... I feel like this is going to kill me?",1,"the narrative displays clear signs of emotional instability and distress. the alternating between crying, laughing, and freaking out indicates a lack of emotional regulation, which is a common symptom of stress. the individual expresses feelings of being upset and unsupported, highlighting a strained relationship dynamic where the boyfriend's comments exacerbate the stress rather than alleviate it. phrases like ""this is all your fault"" and ""no one is making you think these things"" suggest a lack of empathy and understanding from the partner, contributing to the individual's heightened emotional state. the question ""i feel like this is going to kill me?"" reveals a sense of overwhelming despair and anxiety, further underscoring the presence of significant stress. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative filled with typical indicators of stress, including emotional volatility, interpersonal conflict, and expressions of intense distress."

Why do I feel like I’m in the wrong.",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress. the individual expresses confusion and emotional turmoil, evident in their repeated questioning of their own feelings and actions. the sudden shift in emotions after a period of stability suggests a trigger, in this case, a message from the person they are referring to. the use of strong language like ""damn"" emphasizes the intensity of their feelings. guilt and self-blame are prominent throughout the narrative, as the individual repeatedly questions their own behavior and feels responsible for the situation. this internal conflict and the perception of having done something wrong, despite acknowledging no harmful actions from the other party, are typical stress responses. the mention of children adds another layer of complexity and potential stress, as the individual might be grappling with concerns about co-parenting and communication. overall, the narrative is characterized by emotional distress, confusion, and self-doubt, all of which are common indicators of stress."
"My heart is palpitating because I finally responded in a group chat that I'm not so active in because I'm scared nobody is going to care what I say. So I finally responded this morning because the chat seems active and it couldn't possibly hurt right? I'm trying to beat my anxiety. Well, my fears were confirmed. Nobody responded to what I texted.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly social anxiety. the individual describes physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, which are common manifestations of stress. the fear of being ignored and the hesitation to participate in the group chat highlight a preoccupation with social acceptance and fear of rejection. the fact that the person finally mustered the courage to send a message, only to have their fears confirmed by receiving no response, likely exacerbates their anxiety and stress levels. the effort to ""beat my anxiety"" suggests ongoing struggles with anxiety, further reinforcing the presence of stress in their life."

I knew it was weird, but I didn't know it was lovebombing (manipulating) me. Fortunately I never said it back because why the fuck would I love anyone after a week.",0,"the narrative reflects a process of self-reflection and learning from past experiences, which is generally a healthy psychological behavior. the individual recounts an event where they recognized a potentially manipulative behavior (lovebombing) in hindsight, indicating an awareness and understanding of such dynamics. the tone, although casual and somewhat expletive, does not convey ongoing distress or anxiety. instead, it suggests a sense of clarity and detachment from the past event. the use of past tense verbs and the mention of ""fortunately"" imply that the person feels relieved and perhaps even empowered by their ability to navigate the situation without succumbing to the manipulation. this level of insight and the lack of current emotional turmoil are key indicators that the individual is not presently experiencing significant stress."

"I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity. It’s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable. I just feel like I’m nothing but a drain on everyone and an inconvenience. I’m constantly plagued by these thoughts about what a terrible person and I am, and it’s just so exhausting. I wish I was normal.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, including persistent negative self-perception and feelings of inadequacy. the individual expresses a belief that others only tolerate them out of pity, which suggests a lack of self-esteem and significant social anxiety. the cycle of insecurity leading to self-consciousness and standoffish behavior highlights a common stress response where fear of rejection exacerbates social withdrawal. describing themselves as a ""drain"" and an ""inconvenience"" indicates a deep-seated sense of worthlessness, often associated with depressive thoughts. the exhaustion from constant negative self-evaluation further underscores the mental strain they are experiencing. wishing to be ""normal"" reflects a desire to escape their current state of distress, a typical longing in those feeling overwhelmed by their mental health struggles. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone under considerable psychological stress."

Whenever I am allowed to come here I have to bring my own food and own blanket. When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didn’t feel safe to be alone she said I couldn’t come over.,1,"the narrative describes a series of restrictive and unsupportive interactions that are indicative of a high-stress environment. the curfew set at 11 pm for someone in their 20s, along with the lack of a key, signifies a lack of autonomy and trust, which can be very stressful. the constant nitpicking of every action despite efforts to be a good guest highlights an ongoing sense of inadequacy and rejection. the requirement to bring one's own food and blanket when visiting suggests a lack of hospitality and warmth, further contributing to feelings of alienation. the most significant indicator of stress is the response to the individual's disclosure of suicidal thoughts and a need for support; the refusal to allow them to come over in such a critical time shows a profound lack of emotional support and understanding, exacerbating feelings of isolation and hopelessness. these elements collectively point to a deeply stressful and unsupportive environment."

"I've noticed usually people who have been in the street for a while or traveling around, and managed to avoid frying their brains with drugs or just losing it from the life, have really different opinions and ways of thinking compared to the just homeless sleeping in motels or shelters or cars and often trying to work at the same time. Do you hate other homeless aka ""hobos?"" The people in the tents? Or do you wish to or try to help them? Do you resent the middle and upper classes or do you think they're entitled to what they have?",0,"the narrative reflects an observational and analytical tone, focusing on the distinctions between different groups of homeless individuals. the author discusses the impact of lifestyle choices and circumstances on the mental state and perspectives of people living on the streets. there is a curiosity about societal attitudes and a contemplation of social dynamics, such as the potential resentment towards different social classes and the inclination to help others. this type of reflection and inquisitiveness suggests a level of cognitive engagement and emotional detachment rather than personal distress or overwhelming stress. the narrative lacks expressions of personal struggle, anxiety, or emotional turmoil, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, it presents a thoughtful consideration of external social phenomena."

Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way? &#x200B; Is this truly avoidance or is this dissociation?

I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school. Where/how do I start?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author mentions experiencing a ""slow burn"" of overlapping issues, which suggests a prolonged period of stress accumulation. the completion of a phd is a significant achievement, but the author describes feeling ""worn,"" indicating exhaustion and possibly burnout. the identification of psychological symptoms that align with racism-specific ptsd points to a deep-seated and ongoing source of distress. the mention of psychotherapy, coupled with doubts about the therapist's ability to address these specific issues, suggests a lack of resolution and ongoing psychological strain. the author's certainty about having ptsd further underscores the severity of their stress. the desire to begin healing now that grad school is over reflects a recognition of the need for recovery and a shift towards seeking help. these elements collectively highlight the presence of significant stress and the author's urgent need for effective coping strategies and support."
"then i check a side email account that i almost never use, i think i forgot a password or something, and see all these emails from him. he had been sending me them since essentially the day after i stopped speaking to him. saying all this 'i miss you' type stuff, telling me he had something important to tell me. so i caved. and it's been downhill ever since then.",1,"the narrative reveals a sense of overwhelm and emotional turmoil, which are typical indicators of stress. the individual describes checking an email account that is rarely used, suggesting avoidance behavior, which can be a coping mechanism for stress. the discovery of numerous emails from someone they had stopped speaking to indicates a source of unresolved tension. the content of the emails, filled with sentiments like 'i miss you' and hints of something important to convey, adds emotional weight and potential anxiety about the nature of the messages. the phrase ""i caved"" suggests a moment of weakness or giving in to pressure, leading to negative consequences, as indicated by ""it is been downhill ever since then."" this decline suggests ongoing stress and the inability to regain control or find resolution. the overall tone and context highlight the individual's struggle with managing their emotions and the impact of the reestablished contact on their mental state."
I'm in college now and got high last night and felt pretty sad. I'm a wreck. I thought I've overcome this all but I'm just feeling alone again. After trauma i started isolating myself and attaching to creative work to get a sense of worth. I declined socially by a lot and can't feel connected to anyone past a surface level.,1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and symptoms commonly associated with stress. the individual describes feeling sad and alone, indicating a sense of emotional isolation. the mention of being a ""wreck"" suggests a state of turmoil and instability. the narrative also references past trauma, which is a critical factor in the development of stress-related symptoms. the person reports isolating themselves and struggling to connect with others, which are typical indicators of social withdrawal often seen in stressed individuals. the reliance on creative work for a sense of worth highlights a coping mechanism that may not be fully addressing the underlying emotional issues. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that align with experiences of stress and emotional struggle."
"I feel like shit for writing this post. **TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me. Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is, what can I do about it? Our relationship is rock solid, I'm not leaving him. **",1,"the narrative displays several indicators of stress, particularly through the language used and the conflicting emotions expressed. the individual describes feeling awful and guilty, which are strong negative emotions often associated with stress. the use of phrases like ""feel like shit"" and ""guilty as fuck"" suggests a high level of emotional turmoil. the person is grappling with confusion and uncertainty about their partner's behavior, questioning whether it constitutes emotional abuse. this internal conflict, combined with the assertion that the relationship is ""rock solid"" despite the negative feelings, highlights a significant cognitive dissonance. such dissonance is a common stress indicator as the person struggles to reconcile positive and negative aspects of their relationship. the intensity of the language and the emotional conflict suggest that the individual is experiencing a considerable amount of stress."
"From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe. When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful. I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way. I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone. That's what I need the most is some sort of real connection with another human being.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of ongoing anxiety and fear, which are classic indicators of stress. the individual describes a pervasive feeling of not being safe from the moment they wake up until they go to sleep, which suggests a chronic state of heightened arousal and vigilance. this is a common symptom of stress-related disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder. the mention of increased anxiety when around others points to social anxiety, further compounding their stress. despite the cognitive recognition that nothing bad is likely to happen, the emotional response remains intense, highlighting the disconnect between rational thought and emotional experience often seen in stressed individuals. the narrative also touches on social isolation and the difficulty in forming meaningful connections, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and stress. the longing for a real connection underscores the emotional need for support and validation, which is unmet and contributing to their stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone who is experiencing significant stress."
"Only 7 years ago at the age of 9 I think I peaked in life. I was possibly the most fun kid in class and had no problem socializing with others. Used to be so happy then. Now I’m just known by everybody as the quiet guy who rarely ever smiles. Interacting with others (especially girls) is so hard, and I’m always so conscious about how I look.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant shift in the individual's self-perception and social interactions over time, which are common indicators of stress. the author reminisces about a time when they were happy and socially active, contrasting it with their current state of being quiet and rarely smiling. this change suggests a decline in their emotional well-being. the difficulty in interacting with others, particularly with the opposite gender, and the heightened self-consciousness about their appearance are also typical signs of social anxiety and low self-esteem, both of which are often associated with stress. these elements together paint a picture of someone who is struggling with their mental health, likely experiencing stress."
"Quick summary... She kicked her husband out several months for physical, emotional and verbal abuse to her and the kids. Things have been going somewhat civil ever since. He has been paying her child support unmandated by the court (not because he is a good guy, but he moved in with his parents, and they make him pay her). Yesterday there was an incident involving an arguement in their driveway (in front of the 3 kids) which ended with him punching out the side window of her mini-van while her kids were inside it.",0,"the narrative details a tumultuous and potentially dangerous situation involving past abuse and a recent violent outburst. despite the serious nature of the events described, there are elements that suggest a level of control and stability in the author's current life. for instance, the mention of things being ""somewhat civil"" and the husband's regular child support payments indicate some degree of routine and support. while the incident involving the argument and window smashing is undoubtedly distressing, it is described in a matter-of-fact manner, which might imply the author is coping and managing the stress effectively. the involvement of the husband's parents in ensuring he pays child support also adds a layer of external support and accountability. these factors combined suggest that, although the situation is challenging, the author might not be experiencing acute stress at this moment."
"He's the type of guy that doesn't ask for charity. His dad cast a long shadow when he grew up, and even though his dad has passed, the shadow is still there. But I know he's going to need it. His 7yo son, Andrew, has autism and is struggling in school because of it. As a single dad, Matt will now have to find a way to help his son while also managing his own illnesses.",0,"the narrative presents a complex and challenging situation, but it is framed in a way that highlights resilience and determination rather than overwhelming stress. the description of matt as someone who doesn't ask for charity suggests a strong, self-reliant character. the mention of his father's long shadow indicates a significant past influence, yet it does not convey an immediate sense of distress. while matt faces considerable challenges, such as caring for his autistic son and managing his own illnesses, the tone remains factual and composed rather than emotional or frantic. the narrative's focus on matt's potential to find solutions, despite the difficulties, points to a mindset geared towards problem-solving and perseverance. these elements collectively suggest that while matt's situation is undoubtedly difficult, the narrative does not reflect acute stress but rather a steady and resilient approach to life’s challenges."
"I started freaking out, went to the hospital because I couldn't breath. Occasionally I still feel anxiety when alone and bored at my house. My depression is now not a problem at all but the legacy it left is annoying. I feel so terrible being honest about that evil summer but recognizing my post traumatic stress makes me so happy. Any advice I've only recently been honest with myself and I think its about time I realized its not regular anxiety but ptsd.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced significant distress in the past, including episodes of panic and anxiety, and has been to the hospital due to difficulty breathing. they mention a history of depression and recognize lingering effects, which they refer to as a ""legacy"" that is annoying. the individual expresses a sense of relief and happiness in acknowledging their post-traumatic stress and seems to have reached a level of self-awareness and honesty about their condition. despite these acknowledgments, they are seeking advice and are in the process of distinguishing their experiences from regular anxiety to ptsd. the narrative shows a person who is actively working through their mental health issues and seeking clarity, which suggests they are in a phase of understanding and managing their stress rather than being overwhelmed by it."
** > I’d love to but I already have plans this weekend. I am going to my friend’s house. We will play on his new game console! > **That sounds like fun too.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of anticipation and excitement about upcoming social plans, which are indicators of a non-stressful state. the individual mentions having plans to visit a friend's house and play on a new game console, suggesting they are looking forward to engaging in enjoyable activities. this positive outlook and the casual, enthusiastic tone of the conversation are typical signs of a relaxed and content mindset. there are no expressions of worry, frustration, or negative emotions, which are often associated with stress. the straightforward nature of the response, along with the focus on leisure and social interaction, further supports the absence of stress in the individual's narrative."
"It wasn't that long ago, perhaps only a few months that I was in the darkest place that a human can be. Sitting on my kitchen floor with an empty bottle of wine and a knife on my wrist, ready to end it all. And for the first time in my 25 years of existence I though about life and I though about death, after all I was going to experience both within mere moments of each other. A multitude of thoughts raced through my mind. What will it be like?",0,"the narrative describes a deeply distressing and emotionally charged moment, highlighting a period of severe crisis. the individual reflects on their darkest time, mentioning suicidal ideation and the presence of physical tools for self-harm. the narrative captures a moment of intense contemplation about life and death, signifying a profound psychological struggle. despite the gravity of the situation, the narrative lacks ongoing indicators of stress such as continuous anxiety, persistent feelings of hopelessness, or descriptions of current stressors. the focus is on a past event rather than ongoing stress, which is a crucial distinction in understanding the overall mental state of the individual. the reflection on a critical moment, while severe, does not necessarily imply a current state of stress."
"I’m a single father to an 8 year old son. I also have my 7 and 10 year old brothers a lot of the time. Things are really hard right now and everything just added up so quickly. My son has some eating issues, and won’t eat a lot of things because of it. I have done an okay job of keeping the freezer stocked with things that he will eat but he’s going through it pretty quickly.",1,"the narrative describes the daily struggles of a single father who is also taking care of his younger brothers, which indicates a significant amount of responsibility and pressure. the mention of things being ""really hard right now"" and everything adding up quickly suggests an overwhelming sense of burden. the father's concern about his son's eating issues and the effort required to keep the freezer stocked with suitable food further highlights the stress he is experiencing. these are all typical indicators of stress, as they reflect constant worry, the challenge of meeting multiple demands, and the emotional strain of managing a household with limited resources and support."
"She tells everyone who comes over that I must have given birth to the cat and that I'm way too paranoid ""it's just a cat"". Then her granddaughter was playing on her iPad and it was super loud, I gave her a pair of my headphones and told her that she could keep them downstairs but that she couldnt take them to her moms house because I know I'll never see them again. Then she called me an Indian giver and I asked if I should just give them to her and she said ""i dont know, do what you want i guess"". Her granddaughter was playing loudly with a balloon and asked me if I wanted to play with her and I said not right now. Then the landlord was like ""I thought you liked kids??"".",0,"the narrative details a series of interactions that seem to involve minor irritations and misunderstandings, but it lacks the intensity and pervasive negative emotional tone typically associated with stress. the author recounts events with a sense of annoyance, such as being called an ""indian giver"" and dealing with a noisy child, but these incidents are described in a matter-of-fact manner rather than with heightened emotional distress. the author’s responses to these situations, like offering headphones and declining to play with the balloon, suggest a level of control and detachment rather than being overwhelmed. overall, the narrative reflects common social frictions rather than significant indicators of stress, such as pervasive anxiety, feelings of helplessness, or chronic tension."
"No idea where to ask this on reddit.

"Suddenly she snaps and goes ""I fucking hate my brother, he is the biggest piece of shit ever, I couldn't care less about him"" and just started going off. Now, I know her brother can be pretty psychotic and from what shes told me he clearly has anger issues and the rest of her family keeps ignoring it, sometimes even enabling it. So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever. She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him). I didn't want to pry too much because I felt like it isn't exactly my business of their internal family issues, but my girlfriend screenshot the text messages her brother sent her and I just could not comprehend how a human being, especially a sibling, can say that to someone.",1,"the narrative describes a highly emotional outburst, indicative of significant distress. the individual's sudden and intense anger towards her brother, coupled with the use of strong language, points to a buildup of frustration and unresolved conflict. the situation is exacerbated by the brother's reported psychotic behavior and anger issues, which the rest of the family appears to ignore or enable, creating a toxic environment. the emotional climax, where she begins to cry after her father expresses distrust, highlights a deep sense of betrayal and hurt, especially given her close relationship with him. this emotional response is typical of someone experiencing stress, as it shows a combination of anger, sadness, and helplessness. the mention of the father’s favoritism adds another layer of complexity, suggesting that her sense of security and self-worth is being threatened. overall, the narrative is filled with indicators of stress, such as intense emotional reactions, family conflict, and feelings of betrayal and helplessness."
"We had an argument, then he started trying to break my phone by bending it. I intervened and begged him not to and he stopped short of breaking it. I was a domestic violence victim before in a previous relationship and I buried those memories, but this incident made me remember some of those memories and I feel traumatized and scared to be experiencing the same things again. I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse. We don't have kids, and we've been married for a couple months.",1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and potentially traumatic situation. the individual recounts an argument that escalated to physical aggression towards their phone, which they managed to stop. this incident triggered buried memories of past domestic violence, leading to feelings of trauma and fear. the fear of potential escalation into more severe violence adds to their anxiety. the mention of feeling scared and unsure about the future highlights significant emotional distress. the recent marriage and absence of children may contribute to feelings of isolation and uncertainty about the relationship's stability. these elements collectively indicate a high level of stress and psychological turmoil."

Things that I could normally do to relax, like exercise or yoga, are absolutely out of the question because I work 16 hours a day. 3. I am frequently sleep deprived due to my work hours.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress, as evidenced by several key indicators. the individual mentions giving up hobbies and interests outside of work, which suggests a significant imbalance between personal life and professional obligations. the inability to engage in relaxing activities such as exercise or yoga further emphasizes the lack of time for self-care and stress relief. working 16 hours a day is an extreme workload that can lead to chronic stress and burnout. additionally, frequent sleep deprivation due to work hours is a critical sign of stress, as it can severely impact both physical and mental health. these elements combined paint a picture of someone who is overwhelmed and struggling to manage their stress levels effectively."

I had to leave work and go home, which hadn't happened in almost half a year.",1,"the narrative describes a series of emotional and psychological challenges that emerged after discontinuing the depo shot. the individual mentions a significant increase in anxiety, marked by a loss of control over previously managed symptoms. the mention of random days filled with depressive feelings and crying spells indicates emotional instability, which is a common symptom of stress. the intrusive thoughts becoming unmanageable and experiencing an anxiety attack, especially in a new job setting, further highlight the heightened stress levels. the need to leave work due to an anxiety attack, which had not occurred in the past six months, underscores the severity of the stress being experienced. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is undergoing a period of significant psychological distress."

I cut myself off from any meaningful relationships including my family for over 5 years.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant amount of emotional distress and unresolved issues. the author mentions going through a lot over the past few years, indicating a prolonged period of difficulty. the request for advice or connection suggests a sense of isolation and a lack of support in their daily life. the reference to pinpointing the start of their issues and apologizing for the length of the explanation indicates a degree of self-awareness but also an underlying concern about being burdensome or misunderstood. the mention of closure issues dating back to the age of 12, following the death of their grandpa, points to a significant traumatic event that has had a lasting impact. the subsequent decision to cut off meaningful relationships, including with family, for over five years, highlights a pattern of avoidance and emotional withdrawal, which are common coping mechanisms in response to stress and grief. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing considerable stress and has been struggling to cope effectively with their emotions and relationships."

I just want to not be so alone.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional distress and physical pain, which are key indicators of stress. the individual mentions feeling ""horrible physical pain"" and being ""emotionally heartbroken,"" both of which are significant stressors. the mention of a holiday weekend exacerbates the situation, as it highlights a time typically associated with family and support, yet the person feels isolated and unsupported. the fact that their children are ignoring them until they are returned to the other parent adds to their sense of loneliness and rejection. the uncertainty expressed with ""i dont even know why i am posting"" and ""i dont know what to expect"" suggests a lack of direction and hope, further emphasizing their emotional turmoil. the desire to ""not be so alone"" underscores a profound need for connection and support, which they are currently lacking. these elements collectively illustrate a state of acute stress and emotional pain."

"She has no teeth (from abuse or just from scavenging on the streets we’re not sure), perfectly behaved, sweet, trusting, and most gentle dog you’ve ever met. No dog or human aggression at all.

I know I'm going to end up failing the semester, and that's just making my anxiety worse. I' sorry for rambling, I just really don't know what to do, and I have no one to help me. Can anyone give me any advice please?",1,"the narrative exhibits several classic indicators of stress and anxiety. the author mentions that their anxiety is exacerbated by the university environment, which prevents them from seeking help from professors and leads to worsening grades. the inability to form friendships further isolates the individual, contributing to their depression. the mention of lying in bed all the time due to depression or panic attacks highlights the severity of their mental health struggles. the anticipation of failing the semester adds to their anxiety, creating a vicious cycle of stress and hopelessness. the plea for advice and the apology for rambling reflect a sense of desperation and a lack of support, which are common in individuals experiencing significant stress."
"On his 21st birthday, he consumed way too much alcohol to celebrate, and I regrettably saw an entire different side of him. I noticed that he had crazy eyes, and he was being very aggressive in speech. He seemed very off to me, and demanded to know why I didn't want to sleep in his bed that night.

"I can't be in an abusive relationship, but I find my brain trying to rationalize this. To expand a little more, this incident happened just a week after we had a huge fight over my depression, which he doesn't seem to understand completely.

Thanks ahead of time.",0,"the narrative reflects curiosity and a proactive approach to understanding and managing potential stressors. the writer is seeking advice and information on coping mechanisms, which indicates a desire for preparedness rather than an immediate experience of stress. phrases like ""how do you guys cope or manage"" and ""any information or experiences i could hear from this would be great"" suggest an interest in learning from others' experiences rather than expressing personal distress. this kind of inquiry is typical of someone who is planning ahead and looking for strategies to enhance their well-being, rather than someone who is currently overwhelmed by stress. the overall tone is inquisitive and constructive, focusing on gathering knowledge and tools for potential future situations."

"Hi everyone, this is my story, what I've been able to take away from it, and the feelings and the hurt that have lingered, as well as questions. Warning, this is kind of a long post, but there is a lot I need to say and just get out of my head. Trigger and Content Warnings**:** Explicit mentions of sex acts with some details,mentions of coercion, mentions of being threatened, mentions of alcoholism. Things to know about me, for the context of my life and who I am: I am 24, I am queer, my pronouns are she/her, I am trans-gender woman (please Google if you are unfamiliar with the terms), I am autistic, and as a child I was home-schooled for a very long time and lived in the middle of nowhere farm country, with no buses, sidewalks, or means of transportation. When I was 13, I had just found out my father was diagnosed with early onset dementia and I was stricken, to say the least, knowing that my already dysfunctional family was about to go through the horrors of watching my father become less and less of himself.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through various indicators. the author details a complex and challenging personal history, including experiences with coercion, threats, and explicit mentions of sex acts, which are often associated with trauma and stress. the mention of their father's early onset dementia adds another layer of emotional burden, highlighting the impact of family dysfunction and the anticipated deterioration of a loved one. the author also identifies as a transgender woman and autistic, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and misunderstanding, especially given their upbringing in a remote, rural environment with limited social interaction. these elements collectively suggest a high level of ongoing stress, as the author navigates multiple, intersecting sources of distress and seeks to process and articulate these experiences."
"The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress due to the high stakes associated with the scholarship. the fear of losing the scholarship and the consequent financial burden of $20,000 creates a looming sense of anxiety. the uncertainty about the outcomes of either being kicked out or placed on probation adds to the stress, as the individual cannot predict or control the situation. the emphasis on the ""great"" impact of the class on the scholarship and the potential loss of the ae degree further highlights the pressure. seeking advice on improving productivity and mental/physical health indicates a struggle to cope with the demands. the mention of limited support from the fiance, who is preoccupied with wedding planning, and the lack of close friends or confidants underscores feelings of isolation and the need for external support. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress driven by academic, financial, and social pressures."

"I phoned my actual therapist, but mostly I sat alone and chained smoked, if someone talked to me I tried to be nice and polite, and I simply reminded myself that all the evidence showed this would be possible in September, that only by acting out could I fuck it up.

"To make up for it I made a cute little note and I made him a batch of his favorite cookies. I was honestly so damn proud of the gift when I finished putting it together, it looked awesome! To add some context, I have attended a few games with him (and the rest of the family) and absolutely loved them.

"Long story but a few years ago my wife of fifteen years, who had never been with anyone else opened up and told me she fantasized a lot about being with other men, and considered herself somewhat polyamorous. I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things. We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together. Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was. This was really hard for me to hear.",0,"the narrative describes a significant shift in a long-term relationship dynamic, starting with the revelation of one partner's polyamorous desires and progressing to the couple's mutual exploration through swinging. the initial disclosure caused emotional upset and required years of discussion to reach a place of comfort. however, despite the challenges, the narrative emphasizes positive outcomes such as increased closeness and enjoyment. the recent development of one partner expressing a desire to date separately is acknowledged as difficult to hear, but the overall tone suggests an ongoing, open dialogue and a foundation of mutual respect and willingness to navigate complex emotions together. the presence of effective communication, mutual exploration, and positive reflections on their experiences indicate a capacity to manage stressors constructively, which aligns with indicators of a non-stressful state."

I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly through the description of losing control and experiencing a fit. the individual's lack of understanding of what was happening and the subsequent terror upon regaining awareness are classic signs of acute stress. the presence of someone suggesting possession by an evil spirit, and the narrator's perception of this person as feeling ""off,"" further exacerbates the stress response by adding an element of fear and confusion. these elements combined—loss of control, fear, confusion, and a sense of threat—are strong indicators of a stressed state."
"This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her. Am I missing something? She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job.

I called the vet and they suspect it could be heartworms, so while I have the $50 for the office visit, I don’t have the $45 for the test. Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated.

I did eventually get help, but not after having pot butter and a pipe shoved in my mouth. I wasn't in a good crowd back then.",0,"the narrative describes a traumatic event involving forced substance use during a time of severe illness, which led to lasting triggers and distressing associations with certain stimuli. the individual recounts joining support groups to seek help but encountering problems that exacerbate their triggers. despite the recounting of a difficult past and ongoing challenges, the narrative lacks overt expressions of current overwhelming stress or anxiety. the individual mentions eventually receiving help and implies a sense of resolution or coping, which might suggest they are managing their stressors effectively. the presence of structured support-seeking behavior and the absence of acute stress indicators such as panic, helplessness, or despair are relevant factors in understanding the narrative."

I’m not living a lavish lifestyle or rolling around in money. I explained to her that if we divided rent based on income percentage she would actually be paying more per month.

I realize this isn’t the most pressing, serious, or dramatic post on here, but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance, some past experience, wisdom, or advice on what I can do or try so that the “here and now” are in question, and not “then and there”, so that my confession can go along without regret.",1,"the narrative reflects a state of internal conflict and uncertainty, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses difficulty in making decisions and seeks external validation and advice, suggesting a lack of confidence and heightened anxiety. phrases like ""its hard. its real hard to decide what to do"" and ""i stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance"" highlight the person's struggle and desperation for support. the mention of wanting to avoid regret and the acknowledgment that the situation is not the most pressing issue still underscores the personal significance and emotional weight it carries for them. these elements collectively point to a stressed mindset, characterized by indecision, self-doubt, and a need for reassurance."

"It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that. I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no. I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions. I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards. But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the author expresses disbelief and difficulty in reconciling their perception of their wife with her actions. this cognitive dissonance can be a substantial source of stress. the repeated questioning of ""how"" and ""why"" suggests a struggle to make sense of the situation, often a sign of internal conflict and anxiety. the mention of guilt when trying not to victim blame indicates an awareness of the emotional complexity and a struggle with self-reproach. the detailed recounting of events and the effort to understand them further illustrate the author's preoccupation and rumination, both of which are typical stress responses. overall, the narrative's tone, the emotional struggle, and the cognitive dissonance are all consistent with someone experiencing significant stress."

"An app made sense for this, since so many people have a phone. But sometimes a solution can raise more problems! If we had an app that says ""domestic violence escape plan,"" and if the abuser checks the user's phone, that's even worse than a paper form. So here's the solution we came up with: the app is ostensibly a ""quote of the day"" app, just like so many others. You open it up and it just looks like any other, with inspirational quotes (carefully chosen to be relevant without appearing relevant, by the way).",0,"the narrative discusses the development of an app designed to help individuals in domestic violence situations, cleverly disguised as a ""quote of the day"" app to avoid detection by abusers. the tone is pragmatic and solution-oriented, focusing on problem-solving and innovation rather than expressing personal distress or emotional turmoil. the author presents the idea logically and clearly, showing foresight in considering potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them. this structured and rational approach, along with the absence of personal anxiety or stress-related language, indicates a mindset that is calm and composed, rather than one that is experiencing stress."

She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried. Since then things between them got complicated.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events involving another person’s relationship and their emotional responses. the author observes the behaviors and choices of someone else, noting peculiar actions and emotional admissions, such as moving in with a new partner quickly and maintaining contact with an ex despite past hurt. while the narrative contains elements of emotional turmoil and relationship complexities, it is presented in a detached manner, focusing on the actions and feelings of another person rather than the author's own stress or emotional state. the language used is observational rather than reflective of personal distress, indicating a lack of direct emotional involvement or stress on the part of the narrator."

I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life. When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt. Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly stemming from familial relationships and past experiences. the individual describes a history of being judged and shamed by their mother regarding their sexual activity, which has led to feelings of guilt and stress. the mention of a recent pregnancy scare and the mother's reaction to it exacerbates these feelings, as instead of receiving support, the individual felt criticized. this ongoing judgment and lack of support from a close family member can significantly contribute to stress. the narrative also highlights how arguments with the mother often devolve into personal attacks rather than constructive discussions, further adding to the individual's stress levels. these patterns of interaction and the emotional responses they provoke are typical indicators of a stressed state."

He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him I’ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life. But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or he‘s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem. All of this really took a toll of our relationship, to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.",1,"the narrative reveals significant stress indicators through the author's expressions of concern and emotional strain regarding their boyfriend's mental health and the impact on their relationship. the mention of the boyfriend's depression, negative thoughts, and overwhelming stress from university and family responsibilities highlights a heavy emotional burden. the author notes that these issues have taken a toll on their relationship, leading to decreased communication and connection, which are common signs of relational stress. despite moments of happiness and calm provided by their boyfriend, the underlying tension and worry about their partner's well-being and the future of their relationship are clear stress indicators. the contrast between the author's initial joy and the subsequent strain underscores the complexity and emotional weight of their situation."

Why can't movies represent people who have survived childhood sexual assault as strong? Forrest Gump, Jenny becomes a drug addict and is a mess, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang the girl dies, Mysterious Skin becomes a male prostitute. Is that really how society sees us?",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and critical perspective on the portrayal of childhood sexual assault survivors in films. the individual discusses their reaction to the movie ""mystic river"" and the subsequent online commentary, expressing disappointment with the common cinematic trope of depicting survivors in a negative light. their focus is on societal representation rather than personal distress, highlighting a broader concern about media influence. the mention of other films and their characters suggests a pattern of misrepresentation that the author finds troubling. the narrative lacks signs of personal emotional turmoil or anxiety, instead showcasing a reasoned critique of cultural narratives. the discussion is coherent and focused on an external issue, which are indicators of a non-stressful state."

Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off? this is the answer I give when people ask me what's wrong, because there's always more than one thing going on at the same time. I find myself drinking more than i'd like to admit,I never drank before this, anything to take the edge off. I feel like I'm having to teach myself everything all over again, I don't even know how to formulate that into words.",1,"the narrative reflects significant distress and difficulty in managing daily life, which are common indicators of stress. the mention of feeling different from those around them and the struggle to maintain a semblance of normalcy suggests a heightened level of internal conflict. the reference to ptsd and the ongoing challenge it presents highlights a persistent and pervasive sense of discomfort. the author’s description of feeling constantly uncomfortable in their own skin and the inability to turn off this feeling are classic signs of chronic stress and anxiety. the increase in alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism is a concerning indicator of trying to manage overwhelming emotions. the sense of having to relearn basic aspects of life further underscores the depth of the individual's struggle. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with significant stress and psychological burden."

The last time we talked was in May 2017.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging and emotionally taxing relationship, highlighting instances of blame, insults, and obsessive behavior from a partner. despite these difficulties, the individual demonstrates resilience and proactive measures to protect themselves, such as ending the relationship and threatening a restraining order. the narrative reflects a sense of resolution and empowerment, particularly with the mention of the last contact being several years ago. the ability to take decisive action and the passage of time since the last interaction suggest a state of stability and recovery rather than ongoing stress."
"(Edit: sorry if this is very word-salad-esk and difficult to follow, this is one of the only times I’ve ever spoken about this, and the first time writing the entire thing down.

Is he who I would have pictures when thinking of a love interest before we started dating? Not really. He has a different style than my normal type and different interests.

After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going.

I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is subjected to an aggressive and unsettling interaction with someone close to them. the individual expresses feelings of fear, hysteria, and confusion about the future of the relationship. being forcibly removed from a room and then trying to resume normal activities while grappling with intense emotions are clear indicators of stress. the description of the other person's unresolved anger and the individual's decision to avoid further conflict due to genuine fear highlights a high-stress environment. these aspects, such as the forced removal, emotional turmoil, and fear of escalation, are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress."

Especially on nights like these where I can't be quiet without thinking about that night or breaking down in tears.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and symptoms commonly associated with stress. the individual's difficulty with listening to music, watching emotional shows, or sitting quietly without tearing up suggests a heightened emotional sensitivity and an inability to regulate emotions effectively. the mention of a ptsd diagnosis and the acknowledgment of needing professional help but not seeking it due to past experiences and financial constraints further indicates unresolved trauma and chronic stress. the specific reference to ""that night"" and the inability to be quiet without thinking about it or breaking down in tears points to intrusive thoughts and emotional overwhelm, both of which are typical indicators of stress and trauma. the narrative overall portrays a person struggling with persistent emotional pain and a lack of coping mechanisms, reinforcing the classification of experiencing stress."

I do my level best not to dwell on it, I've accepted it's in the past and will never happen again...except that doesn't stop the flashbacks and nightmares. I wasn't directly involved in my traumatic events, I only saw and heard them.",1,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with ongoing stress despite efforts to manage it. the mention of nagging feelings throughout the day and self-doubt about their emotional state are clear indicators of inner turmoil. the reference to past trauma, even though they assert it doesn't bother them as much as before, suggests lingering psychological distress. flashbacks and nightmares are classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress, highlighting the unresolved nature of their experiences. the narrative also reveals a struggle between rational acceptance of the past and the emotional impact that persists, which is typical in individuals dealing with stress-related conditions. the person's effort to handle it alone and the mention of coping mechanisms learned through research further underscore the ongoing battle with stress."

"He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me. When I fell he stomped on my face and also choked me. I was trying to hit back but he's much bigger than me. When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off. He surprisingly did, after yelling about how it hurt, then went to finish packing.",1,"the narrative describes a traumatic and violent encounter, which is a significant indicator of stress. the individual recounts being physically assaulted, including being hit, stomped on, and choked. these actions are extreme forms of aggression and abuse, which can lead to acute stress responses and long-term psychological effects such as post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the victim's attempts to defend themselves, despite being overpowered, highlight a state of fear and desperation. biting the attacker to escape further harm is a survival response, showing high levels of stress and immediate threat. the mention of the assailant's reaction to the pain and their subsequent actions indicates a chaotic and dangerous environment, further contributing to the stress experienced by the individual."

In really shitty medical condition...and now I am going to be cut off from getting messages from any of my doctors, surgeon, or infusion clinic.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, evident in the author's detailed description of financial and medical struggles. the mention of losing essential services like cable, internet, and phone service highlights a sense of impending isolation and disconnection, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and helplessness. the ongoing medical issues, including a series of surgeries and a poor medical condition, further compound the stress, as these situations inherently carry a high emotional and physical burden. the author's concern about being cut off from critical communication with healthcare providers underscores the potential for increased vulnerability and uncertainty about their health. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with substantial stressors, both financial and health-related, which are typical indicators of stress."

Some very mild anxiety yesterday that passed within an hour or so, but that’s been about it.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently started exercising regularly and is experiencing positive effects on their anxiety levels. the person mentions that they have not exercised regularly since their anxiety began but have now been riding their bike daily for the past week. they report significant improvements, noting the absence of panic attacks and only mild anxiety that quickly subsided. the overall tone is optimistic and focused on the benefits of exercise in managing anxiety. this suggests that the individual is not currently overwhelmed by stress, as they are able to identify and articulate effective coping strategies and observe their benefits. the narrative reflects a sense of control and progress, which are not typical indicators of high stress levels."
3. Not wanting it to happen So.... Just drunk? ... Or dissociation?

Walking is painful, talking is painful, I don't know what to do. I just want everything to end. I just want to rest and not have to struggle.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, including feelings of helplessness and guilt. the individual describes a pervasive sense of bad luck and an unfair life, which suggests a negative cognitive bias often associated with stress. the mention of physical pain in walking and talking points to psychosomatic symptoms, where emotional distress manifests physically. expressions of wanting everything to end and a desire to rest highlight a deep sense of exhaustion and overwhelm, common in individuals experiencing significant stress. these elements collectively illustrate the psychological and emotional burden the individual is carrying, consistent with stress-related symptoms."
"I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all ‘bad’ children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected.",1,"the narrative describes a childhood marked by unfair accusations, destruction of personal belongings, and social isolation. these experiences are significant stress indicators, especially when they occur during formative years. the detailed account of being accused of theft at a very young age and the subsequent punishment, without any apology or explanation, highlights feelings of injustice and emotional neglect. the reference to social seclusion further suggests a lack of social support and the presence of controlling behavior from a caregiver. such environments can lead to chronic stress, affecting emotional and psychological development. the narrative's tone and content clearly reflect a history of stressful experiences, contributing to an overall sense of distress and unresolved emotional pain."

One as a server and another as an Army Reserve soldier (both of which I have just started after being unemployed for almost 3 months.) I have almost $15k worth of credit card and vehicle debt to my name and absolutely nothing in savings.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, which can be inferred from the context and specific details provided. the individual mentions being a 22-year-old veteran, suggesting a significant life transition from military to civilian life, which can be inherently stressful. living under the good graces of a girlfriend indicates a potential lack of personal stability and reliance on others for basic needs, adding to the sense of insecurity. the recent start of two part-time jobs after a period of unemployment introduces financial instability and uncertainty about job security. the substantial debt of $15k without any savings further exacerbates financial stress, as the individual faces significant monetary obligations with no safety net. these combined factors—financial strain, reliance on others, job instability, and life transitions—are typical indicators of stress, highlighting the individual's precarious situation and the psychological burden it likely imposes."
"I never personally did anything beyond a ""show me yours and I'll show you mine"" type of thing where another kid and I would see how we ""measured up"", but it felt like those experiences had heavily sexual undertones for me - I don't know if that was me figuring things out or if my mind went there from what happened to me cousin. When I was about 13 I remember thinking to myself that it was crazy that so many of my peers knew what they wanted - I was just really, really confused. I said to myself ""I don't know what I like or which team I go, and I bet that's because of what happened between me and my cousin. I'll figure it out when I'm older"" and that was it. I did what a lot of other kids my age were doing - I hopped online and watched lots of porn.",0,"the narrative reveals a reflective and contemplative approach to past experiences and their potential impact on the author's development. the individual recounts childhood curiosity and confusion but does so in a manner that suggests a process of understanding rather than ongoing distress. the mention of comparing with peers and exploring sexuality online is described as a common behavior among adolescents, indicating a search for identity rather than a source of significant stress. the author expresses uncertainty and introspection, which are typical during developmental stages, but there is no indication of overwhelming anxiety or stress. instead, the narrative highlights a rational and somewhat detached evaluation of past events and their influence, which aligns more with a non-stressful processing of experiences."

I talked about how I suffered from depression in graduate school and compared my symptoms of increased irritability and desire to stay at home with his current behavior. He seemed receptive to the conversation instead of becoming defensive as he usually does, and ultimately I suggested he try counseling, as that helped me. He never pursued it, though.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is actively trying to support and help a family member through a difficult time. the author shows empathy, understanding, and a proactive approach by initiating a conversation about feelings and behaviors. they draw on their own experiences with depression to relate and offer advice. the brother's receptive response and the author's calm, non-accusatory approach indicate effective communication and problem-solving skills. the overall tone of the narrative suggests a thoughtful and measured handling of the situation, which are not typical indicators of significant stress. instead, it reflects resilience and emotional intelligence in dealing with family dynamics."

Plus I can't take off work indefinitely because I'm a basket sake.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through expressions of distrust, self-doubt, and feelings of losing control. the writer's use of intense language like ""going fucking crazy"" and the explicit mention of past traumatic experiences, such as involuntary admission to a psych ward, highlight a deep sense of frustration and helplessness. the financial burden of previous mental health treatment adds to the stress, exacerbating feelings of being trapped. the writer also expresses a perceived lack of support from the healthcare system, which can further intensify stress. additionally, the inability to take time off work without severe consequences underscores a persistent pressure that contributes to the overall sense of being overwhelmed. these elements collectively suggest a high level of psychological distress."

"(I haven’t had to go in and get him for any reason since he started!) On top of all that, I now have a boyfriend who is a real partner in life things. He helps out with childcare when he can, he splits household chores, and we split some bills. I’ve never had this kind of support before and it feels amazing, if not a little strange since it’s a new experience for me. My marriage was certainly not a partnership like this.",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and supportive life situation, which is indicative of a non-stressed state. the individual describes having a reliable partner who shares responsibilities, both in childcare and household chores. this sharing of duties often alleviates stress, as it reduces the burden on one person. the mention of splitting bills further suggests financial stability and mutual support, which are crucial factors in reducing stress. the expression of amazement and the acknowledgment of the new experience highlight a sense of relief and satisfaction, contrasting with the previous marriage that lacked partnership. these elements collectively point towards a content and balanced life, rather than one characterized by stress."
The thoughts that have been pouring into my head theses past few days are terrifying. I wonder what driving my car off the side of the freeway would feel like. The relief that would come at the end.

"Has anyone else had this sensation? Also, if I close my mouth so my teeth are close together, I can tell that they are constantly chattering. I've definitely been much more anxious than usual lately as I work full-time at an emotionally challenging job and just decided to go back to school to pursue a Master's degree via night classes, but this shaky sensation has been a little alarming as I can't tell if it is anxiety related or something worse (which certainly contributes to the anxiety!!). If anyone has any suggestions or words of wisdom, I would be so appreciative. Thanks in advance!",1,"the narrative reveals multiple indicators of stress. the author describes physical symptoms such as teeth chattering and a shaky sensation, which are common physical manifestations of anxiety. they explicitly mention an increase in anxiety levels, attributing it to their demanding full-time job and the additional pressure of pursuing a master's degree through night classes. the uncertainty about the cause of their symptoms adds to their anxiety, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates their stress. the plea for suggestions or wisdom indicates a feeling of being overwhelmed and a desire for support, which are typical emotional responses in stressful situations. these elements collectively suggest a heightened state of stress."

"I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him feeling my ass and masturbating. I was scared, and didn't know what to do so I just pretended not to notice. I can't even remember how long this must have went on, but soon enough I had decided to put my pillow on the other side of the mattress, because he'd touch me when I sleep on my side. I thought putting my pillow on the other side of the bed will help because as I fall asleep and turn on my left side my back will be towards the wall, and he won't be able to reach. I even remember him asking me the next day why I'd decided to move my pillow to the other side of the mattress.",1,"the narrative describes a distressing and invasive situation where the individual experiences unwanted physical contact during the night. the repeated nature of these incidents and the fear of confrontation lead the person to adopt coping mechanisms, such as moving their pillow to avoid being touched. the feelings of fear, helplessness, and the need to change sleeping arrangements to feel safer are clear indicators of stress. the detailed recollection of the events and the emotional impact they had further support the presence of significant psychological distress."

Her father refuses to do anything about her or the other daughter or treats me just as bad. I try to stand up for myself, I mean I am their uncle after all, but they just yell, scream and call me names anyway.

I stay in my bedroom all day, on the computer, making things to sell or doing art.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, including the presence of conflict, feelings of helplessness, and social isolation. the individual describes a hostile and confrontational environment where they are subjected to verbal abuse and lack of support from family members. the mention of a temper tantrum and public humiliation indicates a high-stress interaction. the individual's efforts to stand up for themselves are met with further aggression, contributing to a sense of powerlessness. the long-term nature of this situation, spanning six years, suggests chronic stress. the coping mechanism of retreating to their bedroom and engaging in solitary activities like using the computer and creating art points to social withdrawal, a common response to sustained stress. overall, the narrative depicts a scenario rife with stress-inducing elements and their psychological impact."

"She talked sarcastically about how my life is ""obviously so horrible"" and I'd say ""yeah, mom, it is."" She denied yelling at us all the time, and said that if I can say she yells all the time then she can say I yell all the time too (at my little siblings), which is just not true. I am nice to my siblings, excluding today where I was angry at everything. But I still didn't yell at them. She said that for months I've been terrorizing her about this ""yelling thing"" and how I think that one small mistake automatically means someone is a bad person.",0,"the narrative describes a tense interaction with the narrator's mother, where sarcasm and accusations are exchanged. while the dialogue indicates frustration and disagreement, the narrator's tone remains controlled and reflective rather than overwhelmed or distressed. they provide specific examples of the mother's denial and their own behavior towards siblings, suggesting a level of self-awareness and rational analysis. despite the conflict, the narrator does not express feelings of helplessness or significant emotional turmoil, which are more typical indicators of stress. instead, the narrative shows a person navigating a difficult conversation with a degree of composure and reason."

I don't know how to stop thinking about what happened that night, what I could have done differently, or what would have happened if someone had come to save me.

Good day. I am from the Philippines and I was recently diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety almost a month ago (July 10th).

"I get it; my one friend has personal reasons for being against medication, the other one has a bad personal experience, and my boyfriend had a small midwestern town upbringing that allowed no room for mental weakness so he has a hard time understanding.

"(TW sexual abuse mentions) When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in.

It is a constant strain of thought that I fear the most that developed from the time I was six. Eversince I was six years old I started having weird forced habits like touching certian things for x amount of times or making weird noises.

"One of them was “Catchphrase”. Similar to Taboo, but you pass around a device, and have to get your team to guess the word/phrase before the timer runs out.

He noticed that I was getting more tense as it was passed around the circle, headed towards me.",0,"the narrative describes a game scenario involving a countdown timer, which can be anxiety-inducing for some individuals. however, the overall tone suggests a manageable level of anxiety rather than significant stress. the author mentions feeling more tense as the device approaches but also highlights their partner's supportive role in recognizing and responding to their tension. this implies a level of self-awareness and external support that can mitigate stress. the presence of a partner who is attentive to the author's emotional state and the absence of overwhelming or persistent stress indicators suggest that the situation is under control. therefore, the narrative reflects a typical, everyday experience of mild anxiety rather than a state of heightened stress."
"But I’m pissed, I waited to long for this like I honestly could have killed myself before they got back to me. I know there’s a lot of people in the system and their funding is low, but this is bullshit! The government doesn’t give a shit about mentally ill people. If they did then there honestly would be way less crime rates and suicide rate because people would be getting the help that they need instead of waiting for some bad shit to happen before they get help. The urgency is just NOT there at all.",1,"the narrative displays several clear indicators of stress. the author expresses intense frustration and anger, particularly evident in the use of strong language like ""pissed"" and ""bullshit."" there is a sense of urgency and desperation, highlighted by the mention of contemplating self-harm due to delays in receiving help. the author feels neglected by the system, which exacerbates feelings of helplessness and injustice. the criticism of government and systemic failures suggests a deeper sense of betrayal and lack of support, common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone under significant psychological strain."
"He certainly had/has the ability to. The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.

Again, thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to give me advice when I was struggling, I really appreciate it.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking information and support to better understand and manage their past experiences and current mental health. the person mentions reading a subreddit that aligns with their upbringing, indicating a desire to contextualize their experiences. they are taking proactive steps such as saving money and taking precautions, which demonstrates forward-thinking and planning rather than being overwhelmed by stress. their engagement with a therapist for anxiety and the intention to discuss their findings further suggest a constructive approach to mental health. gratitude expressed towards those who offered advice also indicates a positive social interaction and support network, which are important factors in managing stress effectively. these aspects collectively point to someone who is managing their situation with resilience and proactive measures rather than exhibiting signs of being overwhelmed by stress."
"It's also frustrating because I'm finally getting the kind of help I would expect from family and BEYOND from a woman I met while panhandling this summer. Thanks to a stranger: I've been able to finally get mental health assistance, I got my benefits fixed, I got a job, and I have a safe place to sleep out of the rain or snow. I have somewhere to leave my pack and bed roll rather than carry it around 24/7. I could probably ask to store that stuff, but it seems so asinine to ask more of this woman and especially so since it's just extra supplies for my dog I don't really need. I can't understand why even the bare minimum is too much to ask of the people who are supposed to care the most.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disillusionment with the support system expected from family and close relations. despite these negative emotions, the author highlights significant positive changes in their life due to the help of a stranger. the mention of obtaining mental health assistance, fixing benefits, securing a job, and having a safe place to sleep indicates substantial progress and stability. while there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with familial support, the overall tone suggests relief and gratitude for the improvements in their situation. the acknowledgment of not wanting to burden the helpful stranger further with additional requests shows a level of consideration and self-awareness. these elements collectively suggest a state of resilience and adaptation rather than one dominated by stress."
I make a good living and only want to get on with life. Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have. Thanks for listening. I posted this as there was a guy on the foxnews site dogging people with fake PTSD because his son served in combat and is fine. Mike,0,"the narrative indicates a person who appears to be content with their current life circumstances, as evidenced by the statement about making a good living and wanting to move forward. there is an acknowledgment of the challenges and humiliation associated with filing a claim at the va, but this is presented more as a reason for avoidance rather than a source of personal distress. the mention of a guy on fox news criticizing people with fake ptsd suggests an awareness of external opinions and a desire to clarify their own stance, but there is no indication of internal turmoil or significant emotional disturbance. overall, the narrative lacks expressions of anxiety, worry, or emotional strain that would typically be associated with stress."
"This isn't my post, I have copied and pasted from a friend. It is about a small boy that lives in our neighborhood: On May 5th Brody was a very normal 2 year old boy. His parents took him to the doctor for what they thought was an ear infection. Shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with a very rare brain cancer and given 2 months to live.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a young boy diagnosed with a rare brain cancer, which is undoubtedly a distressing and tragic event. however, the text itself is presented in a detached and factual manner, focusing on the sequence of events rather than expressing personal emotions or reactions. the author mentions that the story was copied from a friend, further distancing themselves from the emotional impact of the situation. this detachment and lack of personal emotional expression are typical indicators that the author is not currently experiencing stress themselves. the narrative lacks the hallmarks of stress, such as expressions of anxiety, worry, or personal distress, and instead provides a straightforward recounting of a third-party's experience."
"I'm 21, and have been on Lexapro for about 2 years. Was diagnosed with GAD the same time I was put on medication. Just graduated this past May from college (I had the worst anxiety of my whole life during my last semester), and I have been doing well since graduation. I started working the graveyard shift a month ago at a non-profit, and the anxiety hit me like a big wave about a week ago. Just all of a sudden, out of nowhere.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators typical of stress. the individual mentions a history of generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and the use of medication (lexapro) for about two years, which suggests a predisposition to anxiety. the mention of experiencing the worst anxiety during the last semester of college highlights a significant period of stress. although they have been doing well since graduation, the recent change to working the graveyard shift at a non-profit could be a stressor, disrupting normal sleep patterns and increasing anxiety. the sudden resurgence of anxiety, described as hitting ""like a big wave,"" indicates a significant and abrupt change in emotional state, which is a common symptom of stress. the narrative's focus on these stress-related experiences and the impact of environmental changes on their anxiety levels supports the classification."
(One is 3 yrs old and the other 19) . Now my dad would beat my mom but over the course of the years as I grew older he turned the violence onto me. He would see that I defended my mom and since I called the police one time (I found him choking her onto the wall) he stopped hurting her and transitioned into beating me. Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before? Well I have an answer to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother.,1,"the narrative describes a deeply troubling history of domestic violence and abuse. the individual recounts their father's transition from abusing their mother to targeting them as they grew older. the vivid description of the father choking the mother and the subsequent police intervention highlights a high-stress environment. the writer's internal conflict and emotional turmoil are evident as they grapple with the decision to endure abuse out of love and protection for their mother. the mention of cutting ties with the father, except for the brother, suggests ongoing familial strain and potential unresolved emotional distress. these elements collectively indicate significant psychological stress and trauma."
"Sister kicked off because she wanted to come to. It was a couple type thing and all of us were bringing a SO or a friend (if one of us didn’t have a partner) even if it wasn’t, I would have just wanted it to be Harry. As I don’t want his sister clinging on to us every single time. Harry asked me if she could come too because “it so unfair that you are isolating her like this.” I stood my ground and said that please can he just come. He said no.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is dealing with a social conflict involving their partner's sister. the author expresses a clear preference for spending time with their partner without the sister's presence, indicating a desire for personal space and boundaries. while there is a disagreement between the author and their partner, the tone remains assertive rather than distressed. the author stands firm on their decision without showing signs of emotional turmoil or heightened anxiety. the straightforward communication and lack of excessive emotional language suggest a composed handling of the situation, which aligns with an absence of significant stress."
"Today i came home from and the girls were up and had the Halloween candy all over the room. Their dad was sleeping alongside them. After a couple minutes of ""bitching"", he says to my oldest, tell your mom to shut up. And so she does. So i get on top of him and i say, don't you ever do that again.",1,"the narrative indicates a high-stress environment, characterized by several key elements. first, there is the chaotic scene of halloween candy scattered all over the room, suggesting a lack of order and control. second, the father's passive behavior, as he is sleeping while the children are causing a mess, adds to the frustration. the term ""bitching"" used to describe the narrator's reaction implies a heightened emotional state and irritation. the father's dismissive response, instructing the child to tell the narrator to ""shut up,"" exacerbates the tension, demonstrating a lack of respect and communication breakdown. the narrator's physical response of getting on top of him and issuing a stern warning not to repeat the behavior indicates a significant level of stress and the need to assert boundaries. these elements collectively point to a stressful domestic situation, marked by conflict, lack of support, and emotional turmoil."
"He is not allowed to show up and cause a scene like that, and he definitely isn't allowed to talk to a child like that, handicapped or not. So, yes, I'm moving. My brother is having panic attacks now, he shouldn't be afraid to be at the house. The only thing is, finding a house on such short notice is proving to be very difficult. We have some blemishes on our rental history from past problems, but have gotten to a much better place since then.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the mention of someone causing a scene and speaking inappropriately to a child suggests a disruptive and possibly traumatic event. the fact that the author is moving due to these circumstances highlights a significant life change under duress. the brother experiencing panic attacks is a clear sign of acute stress and anxiety, indicating a heightened emotional response to the situation. the difficulty in finding a new house on short notice adds another layer of pressure and uncertainty. additionally, the reference to past problems with rental history suggests a background of instability or previous stressful experiences. all these elements combined point to a high-stress environment and emotional strain on the individuals involved."
"come up and live with us and she'd leave me alone with him, wasted out of his mind, while she would be with her boyfriend (who shes now married to). Eventually I moved back with my dad and everything was fine. I'd call and talk to her and she sounded like she had her life together. Well then they broke up for a short period of time, and she moved to live with her half siblings. She would drink excessively, and call me and cry about her life.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events where the individual recounts living with their mother and her boyfriend, moving back with their dad, and dealing with their mother's excessive drinking and emotional distress. while the content involves challenging situations and emotional conversations, the individual reflects on these events with a sense of detachment and resolution. they mention that everything was fine after moving back with their dad and observe their mother's behavior without expressing ongoing personal distress. this perspective suggests a level of emotional processing and stability, indicating that the individual is recounting past experiences rather than experiencing current stress."
"When you can’t remember the simplest things, but your mind is racing a thousand miles a minute, you know it can’t go on. It felt like my sanity was whirling away from me. So I arrived in what I remember to be a thatch of poisonous thorns, ripe with painful, tearful memories. Instead, I have been given the give of honestly looking and starting to deal with the damage of deep scars. Today, instead of jumping on the operating table, eager to right the very wrong right foot, I got to take a bike ride.",1,"the narrative describes a state of mental turmoil and confusion, characterized by a racing mind and difficulty remembering simple things. the author uses vivid imagery, such as a ""thatch of poisonous thorns"" and ""painful, tearful memories,"" to convey a sense of emotional distress and past trauma. the mention of ""sanity whirling away"" indicates a feeling of losing control over one's mental state. despite these struggles, there is a hint of progress and coping, as the author acknowledges the process of dealing with deep scars and choosing a healthier activity, like taking a bike ride, over more drastic measures. these elements collectively point to an individual experiencing significant stress, as they navigate the challenges of their mental and emotional health."
"When I was younger, not even double digits, another minor around my age came very close to sexually assaulting me. It luckily didn’t happen and my two cousins busted the boy’s door. Years later, I couldn’t be around men without feeling anxious. I don’t remember having any nightmares but, I couldn’t trust men. Not even my own father.",1,"the narrative reflects a traumatic experience from childhood that has had long-lasting psychological effects. the individual recounts a near sexual assault incident, which is a significant source of stress and trauma. the mention of feeling anxious around men and an inability to trust them, including their own father, are clear indicators of ongoing stress and anxiety. these feelings of distrust and anxiety are common responses to trauma, especially involving sexual violence. the avoidance of men and the persistent fear suggest symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), which often includes hypervigilance and avoidance behaviors. the individual's inability to recall nightmares does not negate the presence of stress; rather, the chronic anxiety and distrust are more telling signs. overall, the narrative highlights the deep psychological impact of the traumatic event and its role in the individual's ongoing stress."
This week has been bad. I'm crying over everything. I'm struggling at work to get basic tasks done. I am SO HEAVILY OVERWHELMED by the smallest things. My sink was so full of dishes to the point where I had no clean ones left and because the pile was so high I couldn't go near it and just cried.,1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant emotional distress and difficulty coping with everyday tasks. frequent crying, feeling overwhelmed by small tasks, and struggling to complete basic work duties are common indicators of stress. the mention of being unable to handle the sight of a full sink of dishes and reacting with tears suggests a high level of emotional overload. these symptoms are consistent with someone who is under considerable stress, as they indicate an inability to manage routine responsibilities and heightened emotional sensitivity."
"The few days following this I was a wreck, an absolute mess. Crying at work, shaking, anxious, sweating, and couldn't eat. Through the week I wound up losing nearly 6lbs and have been everything from manic depressed to furious, to scared out of my wits to utterly confused aaand all the way back around again. The other night I told him I needed an answer. WHAT are we doing?",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of stress. the author describes a range of intense emotional and physical reactions, such as crying at work, shaking, anxiety, sweating, and loss of appetite. these symptoms are consistent with acute stress responses. the mention of losing nearly 6 pounds in a week suggests a significant impact on their physical health, which is often a sign of severe stress. the fluctuating emotional states—ranging from manic depression to fury, fear, and confusion—highlight the instability and turmoil the individual is experiencing. the urgency and desperation in needing an answer about their relationship status further underscore the stress they are under. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone dealing with considerable emotional and psychological strain."
"I think it’s possible that these feelings are coming from the fact that he has said he loves me while drunk but can’t say it sober. I haven’t brought his up to him, but it makes me feel like he can’t say it because of his ex. Which I understand, but it also makes me sad that he’s not excited to be in love with me. I think part of me also feels like a second choice, or like I’m being compared to her. It’s eapecially awful when I think about how ready I would have been to to go back to my ex when I was still heartbroken.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional struggle and significant relational concerns, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses confusion and sadness about their partner's inconsistent expressions of love, highlighting a disparity between their partner's behavior when sober versus when drunk. this inconsistency creates a sense of insecurity and doubt, exacerbating feelings of being undervalued or secondary in the relationship. the mention of the partner's ex introduces a comparative element, which further intensifies the individual's feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. the narrative also reveals a personal history of unresolved heartbreak, which compounds the current emotional turmoil. these elements collectively suggest a heightened state of stress, driven by relational uncertainty, feelings of inadequacy, and unresolved past emotional wounds."
"Long story short, someone presented a very powerful monologue as a precursor for a healing art session. FollowIng healing art, there were 4 powerful guest speakers. The monologue shook me and put me in a vulnerable space when heading into the healing art. The 4 speakers solidified this. I searched for the right words, and for the first time, I found them.",0,"the narrative describes an experience involving a powerful monologue and subsequent healing art session followed by four guest speakers. the individual mentions feeling shaken and vulnerable after the monologue, which could initially suggest stress. however, the overall tone shifts as they describe the impact of the healing art and the speakers as positive and solidifying. the search for the right words and the success in finding them for the first time indicates a resolution and a sense of accomplishment. the context implies that while there were moments of vulnerability, the experience ultimately led to a constructive and affirming outcome, which are not typical indicators of ongoing stress. instead, they reflect growth and a positive transformation."
"I desperately miss my childhood and I wish I could have it back. After being molested, I feel that it was cut short. I'm afraid of getting older, and getting to the age where l have less time left than I've already lived. I think about it every day and it consumes me entirely. I'm obsessed with extending my lifespan on one end, and just killing myself on the other",1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of stress. the individual expresses a deep longing for their childhood, suggesting a desire to escape their current reality, which is a common sign of stress. the mention of being molested and the impact it had on their childhood indicates a traumatic experience that has likely contributed to ongoing psychological distress. the fear of aging and the preoccupation with the passage of time reflect anxiety and existential dread, which are typical stress responses. the extreme thoughts of both extending their lifespan and contemplating suicide indicate severe emotional turmoil and an inability to find a balanced perspective, further highlighting the presence of significant stress. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress and psychological distress."
"But I don’t know why I get this feeling. What can I do to stop feeling this way? I want to focus on me and my things without having to think about her and what she’s doing all the time, so I can be less distracted and focused on my other priorities. TL;DR I want to focus on my priorities in life but I find myself getting wrapped up in my thoughts about what where, and what my girlfriend is doing.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily through the expression of intrusive thoughts and the individual's struggle to manage them. the repeated questioning about why they feel this way and how to stop it highlights a sense of helplessness and confusion, which are common stress responses. the desire to focus on personal priorities but being unable to due to constant preoccupation with their girlfriend's actions indicates a significant level of distraction and mental burden. this preoccupation can lead to difficulty concentrating on other important aspects of life, which is often a sign of stress. the language used, such as ""wrapped up in my thoughts"" and ""less distracted,"" suggests an ongoing internal conflict and a desire for mental clarity and peace, further pointing to the individual's stressed state. overall, the narrative reflects classic signs of stress through the depiction of persistent, intrusive thoughts and the impact these have on the individual's ability to focus and function effectively."
"Part of me wonders if it's not my mom's fine-tuned manipulation at work, but it's sure as hell eating at me. How do I get out of his harmful headspace? It feels like my emotions and my logic are at war right now. Even after the abuse and trauma I've endured at the hands of my mom I still question the validity of my experience because I know there are people that have it a lot worse. And seeing that video was like watching a train wreck, it made me feel so awful because of its violent nature but it also made me doubt a lot of what I'm still experiencing.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of inner conflict and emotional turmoil. the writer grapples with the lingering effects of past abuse and trauma inflicted by their mother, which is a profound source of psychological distress. phrases like ""eating at me"" and ""harmful headspace"" highlight ongoing mental strain. the mention of emotions and logic being at war underscores the internal struggle and confusion often seen in individuals under stress. the self-doubt about the validity of their experiences, despite acknowledging severe abuse, reflects a common stress response where individuals minimize their own suffering by comparing it to others. the reaction to the violent video further exacerbates their emotional distress, illustrating how external stimuli can trigger and amplify stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant psychological stress."
"Everytime, he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his. He's even broke my iPhone which I bought a long time ago. He doesn't give me money and if I want some, I need a good reason why. He works overnights which makes things very hard for me, because the Long island railroad barely runs during those times and even then I have a 2months old, where would the baby and I go overnight? I don't know what to do, but I'm tired of feeling trapped and helpless.",1,"the narrative contains multiple indicators of stress, such as feelings of helplessness and being trapped. the individual describes a controlling and punitive relationship where their partner takes away personal items and withholds financial support. the destruction of their property, like the iphone, adds to the sense of powerlessness. the mention of having a two-month-old baby while dealing with these challenges, especially with the partner working overnight, compounds the stress. the lack of reliable transportation options further isolates the individual, making them feel more trapped. these factors collectively contribute to a heightened state of stress and emotional distress."
"(NOTE: my grandma was kind to me, but she doesn’t speak a word of English and had no idea about how to get me help) July 30 2011: I think it’s the 30th I’m not sure anymore. I’ve been sleeping so much I can’t tell how long I’ve been asleep. Mom is having a family party today at our house.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is experiencing some disorientation and excessive sleep, which could be seen as signs of stress or other underlying issues. however, the overall context of the narrative, such as the mention of a family party and the presence of the grandmother, suggests a supportive and social environment. the author does not express any overt feelings of distress or anxiety directly related to the events described. instead, the narrative reflects a moment of confusion and tiredness that might be temporary or situational rather than indicative of ongoing stress. the lack of explicit stress-related language and the inclusion of positive social interactions point to a state of non-stress."
"It’s subconscious for sure, but just a feeling I get. I’m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time. And I just don’t know how to sort that out. I don’t know how to stop worrying and wondering what he’s doing, we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it. I’m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress through the use of emotionally charged language and expressions of fear and exhaustion. the individual mentions being ""terrified"" and ""praying"" for someone to get help, indicating a high level of anxiety and concern for the person's well-being. the repeated phrases ""i just don't know"" and ""i don't know how to stop worrying"" suggest a sense of helplessness and persistent worry, which are common symptoms of stress. the reference to ""several court dates"" highlights ongoing legal troubles that are likely contributing to the individual's stress levels. the final statement about being ""exhausted"" and ""ready for this fight to be over"" underscores a deep sense of fatigue and desire for resolution, further reinforcing the presence of stress."
"But even after that he still says things that makes me feel uncomfortable. For example, when I suggest we do something or go somewhere that could be somewhat unique/interesting (e.g., watching a documentary about sex workers in their 60s, or going to a church in Vienna to listen to the choir boys sing), his first reaction via text is ""wtf?"" I instantly feel bad and angry because he is saying wtf to my plans and interests. When I confront him about it, he says he ""wasn't saying it to me."" His excuse is that he was saying wtf about [insert whatever the subject matter was].",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily stemming from interpersonal conflict and emotional discomfort. the individual describes feeling uncomfortable and invalidated by a partner's dismissive reactions to their suggestions. specific examples, such as the partner's ""wtf?"" response to unique or interesting plans, highlight a lack of support and understanding. this reaction causes the individual to feel bad and angry, emotions commonly associated with stress. the repeated need to confront the partner about these reactions, coupled with the partner's dismissive excuses, exacerbates feelings of frustration and emotional strain. these elements suggest an ongoing pattern of stress-inducing interactions, which can significantly impact the individual's mental well-being."
"I instantly thought of something I rarely think about, being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10. My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldn’t even tell my family at the time. I started crying, something I haven’t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do. When it got to me, with my hand over my eyes all I could say was “I don’t think I can”. It felt like I was reliving what I’d gone through, like I could see it happening in front of me.",1,"the narrative reveals significant signs of distress and emotional turmoil. the individual recounts a traumatic event from childhood, indicating a deeply rooted psychological impact. the sudden recall of the molestation incident triggers a physiological response, with the heart beating rapidly, which is a common physical manifestation of stress and anxiety. the difficulty in verbalizing the experience and the act of crying, especially after not having done so for years, further underscore the intense emotional burden carried by the person. the description of feeling as though they were reliving the trauma suggests the presence of intrusive memories, a hallmark of post-traumatic stress. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative marked by considerable psychological stress."

"But I have two questions - 1) should I stop hanging out with these men altogether? My therapist and mother have told me they don't think what these men confessed were a big deal because they were so young while it happened. And 2) I kind of want to tell the most recent guy that him confessing that to me made me uncomfortable, but I don't know if I should or not. I need help because I don't always have the best judgment of what to do and I'm not always the best judge of character. I think it's because of my aspergers, and also because I really want to see the good in people.",0,"the narrative reflects a person seeking advice and expressing uncertainty about social interactions, which is common for individuals with asperger's syndrome. the individual mentions their therapist and mother's opinions, indicating they are actively seeking support and guidance from trusted sources. while they acknowledge feeling uncomfortable with a recent confession from a friend, they are considering how to address this discomfort in a thoughtful manner. their self-awareness about their judgment and desire to see the good in people suggest a reflective and considerate mindset. overall, the narrative does not exhibit signs of overwhelming stress but rather a thoughtful approach to managing social relationships and personal boundaries."

I also panic if anybody raises their voice or sounds angry.",1,"the narrative reveals multiple indicators of stress, including descriptions of fear, panic, and avoidance behaviors. the writer expresses a profound sense of terror and an inability to escape a distressing situation, which suggests a traumatic experience. the mention of ongoing panic and fear responses, such as reacting to pinching, using lighters, and hearing raised voices or anger, indicates persistent anxiety and hypervigilance. these reactions are typical of someone experiencing stress, as they reflect a heightened sensitivity to potential threats and a struggle with emotional regulation. the use of words like ""terrified,"" ""scared,"" and ""horrible"" further emphasizes the intense emotional distress. overall, the narrative contains clear signs of stress-related symptoms and coping difficulties."

Her health condition isn't in completely dire straits like some others on here, but it will be very tough to pay for chemotherapy and the ER visit that led to her diagnosis Any contribution would help, or simply sharing through Facebook or spreading the word is also great. <url>",0,"the narrative describes a challenging situation where a close friend has been diagnosed with stage ii hodgkin's lymphoma and faces financial difficulties due to the inability to work and the costs of treatment. despite the serious nature of the friend's health condition, the tone of the narrative is more focused on seeking practical solutions and support rather than expressing personal emotional distress. the writer is actively looking for ways to help their friend, such as requesting contributions or spreading the word through social media. this proactive approach and the lack of personal emotional expressions suggest that the writer is not experiencing significant stress themselves, but rather, they are concerned and mobilizing resources to assist their friend. the absence of language indicating overwhelm, anxiety, or personal distress is a key factor in this assessment."
"For example, she told me I was too stubborn. This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her. She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth. She refuses to listen to my point of view. We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.",1,"the narrative describes a series of interactions that are highly indicative of stress. the individual recounts being criticized on multiple fronts—political opinions, social behaviors, and pop culture views—by someone significant in their life. this persistent criticism can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and frustration. the mocking behavior described, where their words are repeated back in a childish voice, is a form of belittlement that can exacerbate stress by making the individual feel unheard and disrespected. the refusal to listen to their point of view further isolates the individual, preventing constructive communication and resolution of conflicts. the mention of a recent fight over a christmas present also suggests ongoing tension and unresolved issues. these elements collectively point to a situation where the individual is likely experiencing significant emotional stress due to constant negative interactions and lack of supportive communication."
"Come one, come all. Join us if you need support, or a friendly community to become apart of. **Invitation Link:** <url> We also have a subreddit for people who can't get Discord: r/AngelsWingsSupport **DISCLAIMER:** *We are not medical professionals.",0,"the narrative appears to be an invitation to join a supportive community, highlighting the availability of a discord server and a subreddit for those seeking companionship or support. the tone is welcoming and inclusive, suggesting a desire to help others rather than indicating personal distress. the use of phrases like ""join us if you need support"" and ""friendly community"" emphasizes a positive and encouraging environment. there is no mention of personal struggles, negative emotions, or stress-related experiences, which are often indicators of stress in an individual's narrative. instead, the focus is on providing resources and building a supportive network, which aligns with a non-stressful state of mind. the disclaimer at the end, stating that they are not medical professionals, further underscores the intent to offer a safe space rather than a response to personal stress."
"The misery is so much worse than pre-lamictal, the torment is so much scarier. It feels almost demonic, like someone outside of me is tormenting me (I do not mean this literally or psychotically, it's just my subjective description). I have crying spells all day, I mean the entire day, doesn't matter who I'm hanging out with, doesn't matter if I'm at work (I had to quit for the time being), doesn't matter if I'm working out. I shake and cry and shake and cry, like wailing violent cries. It's terrifying, it feels very ""chemical"" and out of control, like the absence of the drug does this to me, and it's scary for the people around me.",1,"the narrative describes an intense emotional and physical turmoil that is deeply affecting the individual's daily life. the use of words like ""misery,"" ""torment,"" and ""scary"" suggests a profound sense of distress. the individual mentions crying spells that are uncontrollable and occur throughout the day, regardless of their activities or company, which is a strong indicator of severe emotional distress. the fact that they had to quit their job due to these overwhelming feelings further underscores the significant impact on their functioning. the description of the feelings as ""chemical"" and ""out of control"" suggests a sense of helplessness and a belief that these emotions are beyond their control, possibly indicating a biochemical or pharmacological component to their distress. this sense of being overwhelmed and the physical manifestations of shaking and violent crying are typical indicators of high stress levels. the narrative vividly captures the pervasive and debilitating nature of the individual's experience, highlighting the psychological and physiological symptoms commonly associated with severe stress."
"ISOLATION KILLS US &nbsp; UNTIL YOU CAN FIGHT THIS WITH THERAPIES ABOVE, FIGHT ISOLATION &nbsp; ARE THERE ANY OTHERS?",0,"the narrative suggests a focus on combating isolation, which is often a concern for mental health. however, the tone and structure indicate a proactive approach rather than one of distress. the use of phrases like ""fight this with therapies"" and ""fight isolation"" implies a solution-oriented mindset, which is typically less associated with high stress levels. there is no direct expression of personal suffering, overwhelming emotions, or specific stress-related symptoms. instead, the narrative reads more like general advice or an encouragement to others, rather than a cry for help. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional language further supports the interpretation that the author is not currently experiencing significant stress."
"My Social Security disability case is still winding its way through the labyrinth of that particular bureaucracy, but there'd be no need to worry about me cutting into your food, as I do receive SNAP. I *could* get a small storage unit for my belongings while I ""hold out"" around these people, though that'd be less than ideal (and dangerous)... and paying for the unit would cut into the funds I'd need to cover fuel and such getting out and going up North. Hence why I'm trying posting here. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that my friend's car is on the smaller side, which might make a tight squeeze, so if anyone has a larger vehicle, and is able and willing to move me and my stuff from Fort Worth to Fort Wayne, that'd be cool. I'd be able to cover fuel and such (well, so long as it's not a major gas guzzler we're talking about - I've got about $200 for that purpose).",0,"the narrative describes the author's ongoing struggle with their social security disability case and their logistical challenges related to moving. while the situation involves navigating bureaucratic processes and financial constraints, the author remains focused on practical solutions, such as seeking help through posting and managing resources carefully. there is no evident expression of overwhelming emotional distress or signs of psychological strain. instead, the narrative shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving and an ability to plan and manage under the circumstances. these elements suggest resilience and adaptability rather than acute stress."
"I was on a tear. I was dressing better, eating better, losing weight, dating a little, saving some money, I was on my way out of this pit. Now nothing seems to matter. Everyone else is so far ahead of me. I finally felt like I was making up ground and the people around me did too, so they took off the kid gloves they'd been using around me a little bit and sharing more of their lives and I am realizing how completely inadequate I am compared to them and how far behind I really am in life.",0,"the narrative describes a period of positive change and self-improvement, indicating a shift towards healthier habits and a sense of progress. the individual mentions dressing better, eating better, losing weight, dating, and saving money, all of which are positive indicators of self-care and goal achievement. however, the latter part of the narrative reveals feelings of inadequacy and comparison to others. despite this, the overall tone suggests that the person is reflecting on their progress and the temporary setback of feeling behind others. this self-awareness and recognition of past achievements imply resilience and a continued effort towards improvement, which are not typical indicators of stress. instead, they suggest a period of self-evaluation and adjustment rather than overwhelming stress."
"Above all else he made me feel not that I owed him for such affections. He made me feel worth something, that I was important and beautiful. He gave me back my soul and so very much more until I married him. I know this story might not be what you want to read – I didn’t fight the good fight by myself. Nor did I find my self-worth by myself – well I did in a way, but my friend, my love and eventually my husband held my hand with every shaky step I took.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of gratitude and emotional support, which are indicators of a non-stressed state. the author describes feelings of being valued, important, and beautiful, suggesting positive self-worth and emotional well-being. the mention of a supportive relationship, where the partner provided consistent encouragement and companionship, indicates a stable and nurturing environment. phrases like ""gave me back my soul"" and ""held my hand with every shaky step"" highlight the presence of strong emotional support, which typically alleviates stress. overall, the narrative conveys a journey of self-discovery and personal growth facilitated by a loving relationship, which are not commonly associated with stress."
"Lightheadedness/flushed feeling, Burning in head and extremities, Dull Headaches (sometimes in back of head and radiates to front) Disassociation, Vision issues,",0,"the narrative describes a series of physical symptoms including lightheadedness, flushed feelings, burning sensations, dull headaches, disassociation, and vision issues. these symptoms, while potentially concerning, are not necessarily indicative of stress on their own. they could be attributed to various physical health conditions or temporary physiological responses rather than psychological stress. the absence of emotional or cognitive symptoms such as persistent worry, anxiety, or feelings of being overwhelmed suggests that the individual may not be experiencing stress. instead, the focus on physical sensations points towards a different underlying cause, possibly a medical issue that warrants further investigation by a healthcare professional. without additional context or emotional indicators, it is reasonable to conclude that stress is not the primary factor in this narrative."
"However, I still need to figure out my best options. That said, I have a few hundred USD to roll with, as well as a part-time job. I know a shelter that's not awfully far from where I work too. So I have my short-term plan, save for possessions. I'll need to call up some storage units tomorrow to check locations and prices.",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is dealing with logistical and financial planning in a composed and pragmatic manner. they mention having a part-time job and some money, which indicates a level of stability and resourcefulness. the reference to a shelter and storage units shows they are proactively planning for their needs and have a clear, organized approach to their situation. there is no indication of overwhelming anxiety or emotional distress; rather, the tone is matter-of-fact and focused on practical solutions. these elements suggest that the individual is managing their circumstances without significant stress."
"He gave me a pill to “stay awake,” claiming it was a caffeine pill. It didn’t seem to work. We started having sex, and right off the bat I could tell this was weird. He was completely quiet, wearing all of his clothes. He touched my labia (I have an innie vagina) and was like “What the fuck is this...”",0,"the narrative describes a peculiar and uncomfortable experience, but it does not exhibit clear signs of stress. the individual recounts the event in a straightforward manner, without expressing significant emotional distress or anxiety. the tone is more observational and detached rather than overwhelmed or distressed. there is a lack of language indicating panic, fear, or intense worry, which are common indicators of stress. while the situation described is unusual and potentially troubling, the narrative itself does not convey a heightened emotional state typically associated with stress."
"I started talking to a girl, 'J', on Tinder about a month ago. She's funny, attractive and quick-witted, however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away. We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city. She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her, including travel to her city to meet her), however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her, and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week. If I did this, then she would meet me on the day afterwards.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is navigating the early stages of a potential romantic relationship. the tone of the writing is relatively neutral and matter-of-fact, focusing on recounting events rather than expressing strong emotions or distress. the individual provides specific details about their interactions and the reasons given by 'j' for not meeting up, but there is no indication of heightened anxiety or emotional turmoil. the person's approach to the situation appears pragmatic, as they are willing to follow 'j's request to talk on the phone every evening for a week. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, worry, or emotional strain typically associated with stress, suggesting that the individual is managing the situation with a level-headed and patient mindset."
"Secondly; after 3 years of countless meds and as many strains of dank as you can think of, I finally discovered my cure to anxiety. I've heard handfuls of people say music helps but that's never been that case for me. Until tonight. I started listening to kid Cudi during an anxiety attack, I've been listening to him for a long time but never during an episode, I discovered his music helps me significantly. More than any meds I've ever tried.",0,"the narrative describes a positive experience of finding relief from anxiety through music, specifically mentioning the artist kid cudi. the individual shares a sense of discovery and satisfaction, indicating that they have found a method that works better than previous treatments. the tone is optimistic and reflective, focusing on the success and effectiveness of this new coping mechanism. the absence of negative emotions, such as frustration or despair, and the presence of hope and relief are key indicators that the individual is not currently experiencing stress. the emphasis on the positive impact of music and the resolution of a long-standing issue suggests a state of well-being and contentment."
"Anxiety my \*\*\*, that \*\*\*\* gave ME anxiety, being surrounded like that. * &#x200B; Skipping to college, at this point I really didn't care about anything anymore, and it didn't help that I met a girl who completely split me and my friend apart (that's a long story in of itself), and started skipping a lot of my classes. I had good grades in my computer programming class, because I was actually curious for a while, but that was about it.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events and emotions that might suggest a level of distress, but certain aspects indicate a more complex picture. while the author mentions feeling anxiety and describes a significant social disruption involving a friend and a girl, the overall tone lacks the pervasive sense of helplessness or overwhelming stress typical of highly stressed individuals. the mention of maintaining good grades in computer programming despite skipping other classes suggests some level of engagement and interest, which can be inconsistent with severe stress. the narrative also lacks descriptions of physical symptoms, persistent negative thoughts, or a sense of impending doom that are often associated with high stress levels. instead, the experiences seem more situational and related to specific incidents rather than an ongoing, pervasive stress response."
I was able to get my old office job back and that comes with okay pay and good benefits I start November 1st . Just trying to take steps to make sure we’re okay before we get too behind and stuck on the streets . Anything is appreciated all I have 11$ to my name until Friday . Pm me you would like to help . I am starting a gofund me sometime this week to help us if anyone is interested in that I will keep you updated,1,"the narrative reflects significant stress through several key elements. the individual discusses their precarious financial situation, highlighting that they only have $11 until friday, which indicates immediate financial pressure and insecurity. the mention of getting their old office job back with okay pay and good benefits suggests a recent period of unemployment or underemployment, contributing to their current stress. their proactive steps to prevent becoming homeless, such as starting a gofundme and seeking help from others, further illustrate their desperation and urgency. the language used, such as ""just trying to take steps to make sure we're okay"" and ""before we get too behind and stuck on the streets,"" reveals an underlying anxiety about their future stability and well-being. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as they involve financial strain, uncertainty about the future, and the need for external support to cope with immediate challenges."
"His mother would say, ""Who would love you if you look like that?"" or ""Why couldn't I have a fit and handsome son."" So he has his own issues with his body image and weight. He also went a few years without being physical with anyone because he never thought that anyone would be interested or love him because of his appearance. He had a few years where he got very fit and had six pack but eventually lost it as he got older.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has faced critical comments from his mother regarding his appearance, which has led to body image issues and a lack of confidence in his attractiveness. despite these challenges, the narrative indicates that he has had periods of physical fitness, including achieving a six-pack, although he eventually lost it as he aged. the presence of body image concerns and fluctuating self-esteem are noted, but the narrative lacks acute indicators of overwhelming stress. there is no mention of severe distress, functional impairment, or significant emotional turmoil that would suggest a high level of stress. instead, the narrative focuses on past experiences and changes over time, without emphasizing current or intense stress responses."
"It sent me into a full-blown crisis by breaking open the “no one believes me and I’m worthless” wound. I had to up my level of care, now I’m in IOP 5 days a week, 3+ hours a day. It’s given me just enough relief to return to weekly EMDR. I had my first session in this round, last week. It was the most physically symptomatic I’ve ever been in-session.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the description of a crisis and the subsequent need for increased mental health care. the mention of feeling ""worthless"" and that ""no one believes me"" points to deep emotional distress and negative self-perception, which are common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress. the escalation to intensive outpatient program (iop) five days a week for over three hours a day underscores the severity of the situation and the necessity for intensive therapeutic intervention. the return to weekly eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) therapy further highlights ongoing efforts to manage and alleviate symptoms of trauma and stress. the physical symptoms experienced during the emdr session indicate that the stress is manifesting not just emotionally but also physically, which is a typical response in severe stress cases. overall, the narrative clearly illustrates a person under significant stress, requiring extensive support and treatment to cope with their emotional and physical symptoms."
"I keep trying, hoping we can be what we were...that the man I fell in love with will return. What’s happening here? Why rage at your wife when she tries to be affectionate? Is this just another control tactic? He also stated that I had completely cut him out of my life (I have been spending time with women friends and taking classes).",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is grappling with confusion and seeking clarity in their relationship. while there are elements of emotional turmoil, such as questioning their partner's behavior and expressing hope for the return of a previous dynamic, these are typical concerns that arise in many relationships. the individual also mentions engaging in social activities and personal development, such as spending time with friends and taking classes, which are positive coping strategies and indicative of maintaining a balanced life. these actions suggest that the person is not overwhelmed by stress but rather actively working through their emotions and circumstances."
"He doesn't have to spend a load of money on things I like! He can use it to spend on himself. I don't understand why he feels that just because we're in a relationship that he has to ""spoil"" me. I enjoy being spoiled but only when I'm the one spoiling myself, haha. TL;Dr: My boyfriend doesn't like that I don't want him to do anything for me",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly relational stress. the author expresses frustration and confusion about their boyfriend's behavior and expectations within the relationship. the repeated emphasis on not wanting to be spoiled suggests an internal conflict and discomfort with the dynamics of giving and receiving in the relationship. this can be a source of stress as it implies a misalignment of values and desires between the partners. the use of exclamatory language (""he doesn't have to spend a load of money!"") further indicates heightened emotions. the closing statement, ""my boyfriend doesn't like that i do not want him to do anything for me,"" underscores a significant interpersonal tension, which is a common stressor. overall, the narrative reveals stress through the writer's struggle to reconcile their own preferences with their partner's actions and expectations."
"Sometimes I feel like I’m the third wheel in their relationship. And this doesn’t even include what they may do when I’m not around! Also, whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend, I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast, and say he knows roommate isn’t attracted to said guy or doesn’t want/need a boyfriend. There’s definitely an emotional dependency there. I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.",1,"the narrative reflects feelings of being an outsider and concerns about the dynamics between the husband and the roommate. the mention of feeling like a ""third wheel"" indicates a sense of exclusion and discomfort. the suspicion about what might happen when not present suggests anxiety and mistrust. the husband's quick dismissal of the roommate's interest in boys or a boyfriend points to a controlling behavior, which can heighten stress for the narrator who might feel their partner is overly involved with someone else. the emotional dependency described adds to the stress, as it suggests a complex and potentially unhealthy relationship dynamic that the narrator is struggling to understand and accept. these elements collectively indicate significant stress related to relationship insecurities and perceived boundaries being crossed."
"If you were raped on a daily basis from infancy through adolescence then you should ""radically accept"" it. Check out the parts of Linehan's book where she explains how unconditional positive regard is a myth, nonexistent. The part where she explains about paradoxical intervention. That is where you manipulate and jerk your client around using head games and reverse psychology. Then there is radical genuineness.",0,"the narrative exhibits a critical and somewhat sarcastic tone towards therapeutic concepts and techniques. it discusses sensitive and traumatic experiences, such as daily rape from infancy through adolescence, and references specific therapeutic methods like radical acceptance and paradoxical intervention. the mention of ""manipulate and jerk your client around using head games and reverse psychology"" suggests a deep skepticism or disillusionment with these therapeutic approaches. however, the tone and focus on critiquing therapeutic methods rather than expressing personal distress or emotional turmoil are indicators that the author is not currently experiencing acute stress. instead, the narrative reflects a detached, analytical, and possibly cynical perspective, which is not typical of someone in a state of high stress. the emphasis on discussing theoretical aspects of therapy rather than personal emotional experiences further supports this assessment."
"1) They are considered a ""small business"". I know that small businesses are still required to follow ADA standards for customers, but does the same go for employees? I haven't really read anywhere about my rights except that I can't have FMLA. 2) I feel safer to wear a heavy coat at work, I know it looks unprofessional and my boss constantly asks me to take it off. Is it unreasonable that i request an ""accommodation"" to be able to wear it and is it considered harassment if I make them aware of why I'm wearing it and still ask me to take it off?",0,"the narrative reflects concerns about workplace policies and personal accommodations. the author is inquiring about ada standards and their rights as an employee, indicating a proactive approach to understanding legal protections rather than exhibiting stress. they mention feeling safer wearing a heavy coat at work and question whether requesting this accommodation is reasonable. while the situation might be frustrating, the narrative lacks expressions of overwhelming anxiety, distress, or other emotional cues typically associated with stress. the focus remains on seeking information and clarification, suggesting a logical and composed mindset."
"Whenever I have a reaction or meltdown, he always tries to give shitty advice like ""just think about the things you're grateful for."" I'm sorry, but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me, nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me. I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help. I told him how important it was to me for him to read these books because it would help me feel more understood, but he keeps coming up with excuse after excuse about why he doesn't want to read them. I just don't know what to do anymore.",1,"the narrative reveals a high level of emotional distress and frustration. the author describes experiencing reactions or meltdowns, which are common indicators of stress. their partner's attempts to offer advice are perceived as unhelpful and triggering, particularly because they echo phrases used by a problematic figure from their past, their mother. this connection to a negative experience exacerbates their stress. the author's attempt to communicate their needs and seek understanding from their partner is met with resistance and anger, further heightening their sense of frustration and helplessness. the repeated dismissals and lack of support from the partner contribute to the author's feeling of being misunderstood and alone in their struggles. these elements collectively illustrate a situation where the individual is dealing with significant stress and emotional turmoil."
"I’ve started unearthing old albums; I’ve gone back to practising the drums regularly; I’ve been watching more movies and reading more books. Weirdly enough, I feel more in touch with the world. And what now? Will I continue along the road of abstinence? I don’t see any reason to jump off the wagon at this stage.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of positive engagement and personal growth. the individual describes engaging in hobbies and activities such as unearthing old albums, practising the drums, watching movies, and reading books, which are typically associated with relaxation and enjoyment. these activities suggest a focus on self-care and a reconnection with personal interests, which are not common indicators of stress. additionally, the expression of feeling ""more in touch with the world"" implies a sense of connection and well-being rather than isolation or overwhelm. the contemplation of continuing along a path of abstinence without any inclination to revert to old habits further indicates a stable and content mindset. overall, the narrative demonstrates behaviors and attitudes that align with a non-stressed state, emphasizing self-improvement and a positive outlook on life."
"- Lastly, it may be perceived to imply that having a positive mind frame will solve problems. As I understand it, this is not the message, only that there are methods to help overcome negative thinking of which this is one, but there are no guarantees. To be clear, this is not intended to be a 'cure', nor do I know if it applies to everyone, understanding is an important to recovery/reducing anxiety. and for me it helped. Beneath I will post what I discovered and how this has helped me.",0,"the narrative reflects a balanced and reflective mindset. the author discusses the concept of positive thinking and its potential benefits, while also acknowledging its limitations and the lack of guarantees. the language used is thoughtful and measured, indicating a clear understanding of the topic without any signs of overwhelming distress or anxiety. the mention of personal experience and how certain methods have helped the author suggests a proactive approach to mental well-being. the focus on understanding and recovery, along with the intention to share helpful discoveries, further underscores a sense of control and composure. these elements collectively point to a state of mind that is not dominated by stress."
We could make an arrangement where I occasionally ship you boxes of stuff. (PS I'm new to this subreddit and not sure how to ask for proof from you... I guess you could PM me a pic of your kid? Idk if that's weird. I'm happy to PM a pic of my kid bc he's super cute :),0,"the narrative reflects a casual and friendly tone, suggesting a person who is engaged in a lighthearted conversation. the mention of making an arrangement and shipping boxes of stuff implies a practical and solution-oriented mindset, rather than one preoccupied with worry or anxiety. the writer's uncertainty about how to ask for proof and the playful suggestion of exchanging pictures of their children further demonstrate a relaxed and open attitude. the use of humor and the willingness to share personal information like a picture of their child indicates comfort and trust, which are not typically associated with stress. overall, the narrative lacks signs of tension, urgency, or emotional distress, pointing to a state of calm and ease."
"Leaving was one of the hardest things I had ever had to do. My parents really disagreed with me taking time off from school, so as fall came, they spent every day trying to get me to go see if I could come back in the spring, and to get a job. Now job has always been a scary word for me, because my only job I've had is teaching people how to hit things beautifully (Percussion Private Lessons). I had come so close to interviews in the past, but I could never get myself to leave as the day came. This lead to my parents becoming more and more frustrated, and the only person I could seek refuge with, was Sarah.",0,"the narrative discusses the difficulty of leaving school and the pressure from parents to find a job. while the author expresses fear and anxiety about job hunting, particularly due to a lack of previous experience, they also mention having a supportive figure in sarah. the presence of a supportive person can act as a buffer against stress, providing emotional relief and preventing the situation from becoming overwhelming. the author's acknowledgment of their parents' frustration indicates awareness and communication within the family, which can also help mitigate stress. overall, despite the challenges mentioned, the narrative reflects coping mechanisms and social support that are effective in managing potential stressors."
"While sitting on my normally-quiet front porch today, one of my unbelievably extroverted neighbors was carrying on the loudest conversation I've ever heard on a quiet street. Her conversation partners used a normal volume - she was the only one yelling words at the top of her lungs. I wanted to snap her clueless little head off. Or at the very least, tell her to shut the f$*( up. Grumpy?",1,"the narrative exhibits clear signs of irritability and frustration, which are common indicators of stress. the individual describes an intense emotional reaction to a relatively minor annoyance, such as a neighbor speaking loudly. the use of extreme language like ""snap her clueless little head off"" and the desire to tell her to ""shut the f$*( up"" suggests a heightened emotional state and difficulty managing anger. these exaggerated responses to everyday situations often point to underlying stress. the context of a normally quiet environment being disrupted may exacerbate feelings of annoyance, but the intensity of the reaction goes beyond what would be expected from a non-stressed individual. such disproportionate emotional responses are typical indicators of stress, reflecting an underlying difficulty in coping with external stressors."
"She never messaged him back, but I asked her why she still had him on Snapchat. I only asked it because she had claimed to have deleted her ex's on social media. Whatever, that's a nice feeling and I'm glad, but at the same time it wouldn't really be an issue for me if she did still have them. Fast forward to last night... My fiance was acting all weird and put out so I tried figure out what was going on and what she was upset about.",0,"the narrative presents a situation where the individual is describing an interaction with their fiancée regarding social media connections with her ex. the person narrates their curiosity about why the fiancée still has her ex on snapchat despite her previous claims of deleting him. the tone of the narrative is relatively calm and reflective, noting that it wouldn't be a significant issue if she still had her ex on social media. the individual also describes an attempt to understand their fiancée's unusual behavior the previous night. the language used is measured and lacks signs of heightened emotional distress or anxiety. the focus is on understanding and resolving a minor relationship concern rather than expressing intense worry or emotional turmoil. this suggests a level-headed approach to the situation, which is not typically indicative of someone experiencing significant stress."
I have been trying to make plans recently and she keeps having things come up but i understand because i am doing it on kind of short notice. This last little bit after the break happened in about a 8 day span. TLDR: I am awkward and need some help with relationships. I feel like i ruined my chances with this girl and i am hoping i can fix it. I also may just be overreacting to things.,0,"the narrative reveals an individual who is reflecting on their social interactions and expressing a desire to improve their relationships. the person acknowledges the short notice of their plans and shows understanding of the other person's situation, which indicates a level of self-awareness and rational thinking. the mention of feeling awkward and needing help with relationships is common in many people and doesn't necessarily point to stress. instead, it reflects a normal concern about social skills and a desire for self-improvement. the individual also considers the possibility of overreacting, which suggests they are open to different perspectives and not fixated on a single negative interpretation. these aspects of self-reflection, understanding, and rational consideration are typical of someone who is not experiencing significant stress."
"My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful. Im ready to take him out of my life, but what should I do? When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to. How should I handle it? Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?",1,"the narrative indicates a significant level of stress stemming from a controlling and jealous partner. the writer expresses concern about the partner's unpredictable anger, which is a common source of anxiety and fear. the uncertainty about how to handle the situation, whether to ignore or communicate calmly, highlights the ongoing mental strain and the need for a safe and effective strategy. the mention of friends and family not understanding the partner's behavior adds to the feeling of isolation and confusion, which are typical indicators of stress. the writer's readiness to remove the partner from their life suggests a desire to escape the stressful environment but also reflects the inner turmoil and apprehension about the potential consequences."
"She's a real healer. She's beautiful in so many ways 🐰🥕 but it's just insane. I won't lie, she is the most expensive medication that I've ever had as she's already cost £2,000 ($2,654.510) (when I say medication, I mean that she's a therapy rabbit) but I do love her to bits. I'm actually thinking of getting another pet soon. My mum has said ""yes"" but she won't allow me to have another big animal as she has to sometimes help me with Alaska because believe it or not bunnies can sometimes be a handful.",0,"the narrative describes a person who finds great joy and therapeutic value in their pet rabbit, alaska. the individual expresses deep affection and appreciation for the rabbit, referring to her as a ""real healer"" and acknowledging the significant financial investment made for her. the tone of the narrative is positive and filled with gratitude, as the writer mentions their love for the rabbit and even considers getting another pet. the mention of the mother's support, albeit with some limitations, further suggests a supportive environment. there is no indication of overwhelming stress or negative emotions; instead, the narrative focuses on the beneficial and uplifting aspects of having a pet. the writer's enthusiasm and plans for the future indicate a hopeful and content state of mind, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"Maybe kind of nauseous? Not in a normal nauseated feeling. Its more like that pit of my stomach, I'm about to get in big trouble, or I'm waiting for the cops to come pick me up or something haha. Like, it has that prickle in my spine to it. And that restlessness in my head.",1,"the narrative reflects several classic indicators of stress, starting with the description of nausea, which is not typical but rather associated with anxiety or fear. the comparison to feeling like one is about to get in big trouble or waiting for law enforcement suggests a heightened state of alertness and apprehension. the mention of a ""prickle in my spine"" indicates a physical manifestation of stress, often linked to the body's fight-or-flight response. additionally, the restlessness in the head points to an inability to relax or quiet the mind, which is a common symptom of stress. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing significant stress, as they describe both physical and psychological symptoms that are often present in stressful situations."

"He apologizes if I point it out later, but the first instinct is always to blame me. And often the thing he's blaming me for is exaggerated, and made to look like a routine flaw in me, even if it's a once off thing. He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me, but I think it's worse when it's about me). He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people, so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public.

The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up.

Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that. Thanks in advance!",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the individual expresses frustration and annoyance at a recurring situation where their expectations for quality time with a friend are disrupted by the presence of the friend's girlfriend. the anticipation of ""bro time"" being spoiled and the need to navigate the awkwardness of either enduring uncomfortable conversations or finding a polite way to leave early highlights the individual's stress. their concern about communicating their feelings without offending their friend or seeming opposed to the girlfriend adds to the emotional burden. the repetitive nature of the situation and the struggle to find a resolution underscore the stress the individual is experiencing."
