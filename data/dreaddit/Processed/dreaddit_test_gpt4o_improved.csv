"This is good and bad... I was a STEM major before and probably would have had a challenging and high paid career by now, had my life taken a different course. However, post PTSD, I found myself extremely connected with the arts. I have intense emotional reactions to aesthetic experiences, and I think that’s largely responsible for the fact that I now work in a creative industry. I experience aesthetics in a unique way that I’m not sure resonates with the typical non-affected individual.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and adaptation rather than stress. the individual acknowledges a significant shift in their career path due to post-ptsd experiences but describes this transition in a positive light. they express a deep connection to the arts and derive intense emotional satisfaction from aesthetic experiences, which suggests a healthy coping mechanism and personal growth. the tone is contemplative and introspective, focusing on the benefits and unique perspectives gained from their experiences. rather than expressing distress or regret, the individual seems to have found a fulfilling and meaningful path, indicating a state of well-being and resilience. the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of stress such as anxiety, frustration, or overwhelming negative emotions. instead, it highlights an adaptive response to life changes and a positive redefinition of their identity and career."
"**Remember Need to Know**. Only tell people about your plans if they absolutely need to know and can be trusted.

Most browsers keep a record of websites you visit.",0,"the narrative reflects a cautious and vigilant mindset, emphasizing the importance of privacy and security. while it advises on limiting information sharing and being careful with online activities, these suggestions are framed as practical tips rather than stemming from an emotional state of stress. the tone is more instructive and preventive, focusing on maintaining control and ensuring safety. there is no explicit indication of anxiety, worry, or emotional distress; instead, the advice seems to be driven by a desire for precaution and strategic planning. such a narrative is consistent with a careful and methodical approach to personal security rather than an expression of stress."
"**Get a new phone**. One option is to purchase an inexpensive, reloadable cell phone from any major retailer. These phones, commonly referred to as “burner phones” will have no connection to the abuser and can help you keep in touch with your support system. Another option is to visit a retail location for your provider and have them move you over to a new plan. If they don’t offer you a new phone with the plan, make sure they perform a factory reset of the device to ensure any apps that could track your location are removed.",0,"the narrative provides practical advice on obtaining a new phone, either through purchasing a burner phone or visiting a retail location to switch plans and ensure privacy. the tone is informative and solution-focused, emphasizing steps to enhance personal security and maintain communication with a support system. it suggests a proactive approach to addressing potential issues without displaying signs of emotional distress or anxiety. the clarity and structure of the instructions indicate a level-headed mindset, concentrating on actionable measures rather than expressing feelings of overwhelm or stress."

Also, try to hide the fact that those things are being moved at all * Any emergency code words, such as those used with children to indicate safety or danger * New, private bank accounts",0,"the narrative provided appears to be a structured and methodical plan for an emergency situation. it includes detailed instructions on preparing for departure, securing essential items, and establishing safety protocols. the focus on organization and preparedness, such as setting up private bank accounts and having emergency code words, indicates a proactive and controlled approach. there is no mention of emotional distress, anxiety, or overwhelming feelings typically associated with stress. instead, the narrative reflects a calm and rational mindset, emphasizing practical steps and clear thinking. the absence of chaotic or disorganized thoughts further supports the indication that the individual is not experiencing stress in this context."
"**While at a shelter** Depending on the nature of the shelter, you may be asked to follow specific security rules designed to protect you, other residents, and the shelter staff. Although those rules may sometimes seem a little bit restrictive, it’s important to follow them for everyone’s safety. If the abusive partner had access to your cell phone or your account, you may be asked to remove your phone’s battery, and maybe even wrap it in tinfoil to block any transmissions. Although this may sound a little bit extreme, this might be done because a cell phone may be used to track you or find out where you’re going.",0,"the narrative provides detailed instructions and rational explanations for the security measures in a shelter, which are aimed at ensuring the safety of the residents and staff. the tone is informative and pragmatic, focusing on the importance of following rules to prevent any potential threats from an abusive partner. there is no evident emotional distress or anxiety in the description; instead, it emphasizes practicality and precaution. the language is calm and composed, without any signs of personal turmoil or heightened emotional states that are typically associated with stress. the author seems to be providing helpful advice in a clear and rational manner, which suggests a state of non-stress."
"**While traveling to a safe location** **Don’t take the most direct route** to your destination. When you leave, head off in the opposite direction from where you’re actually headed, just in case someone sees you leave and may tell the abuser which direction you went. Afterwards, double back and take another route to your actual destination. **Know what to look** for to make sure you’re not being followed.",0,"the narrative provides practical advice on ensuring personal safety and evading a potential abuser, suggesting strategies like taking indirect routes and being vigilant about being followed. while the content addresses serious and potentially distressing situations, the tone and structure indicate a focus on rational, strategic planning rather than emotional distress. the instructions are clear and methodical, emphasizing caution and awareness rather than expressing fear or anxiety. this approach suggests a proactive mindset aimed at problem-solving and maintaining control over the situation, which are not typical indicators of stress. instead, it reflects a composed and logical response to a challenging scenario, highlighting the importance of safety without conveying personal emotional turmoil."
"As I kid, I had been pretty anxious and nervous, but they were negligible. I only got anxious when there was something happening, like giving presentation etc. They did not tamper with my everyday life and I was not concerned with them. But recently, I felt like my anxiety has developed into a new level. I got so damn anxious for every day stuff.",1,"the narrative indicates a significant shift in the individual's experience of anxiety. initially, their anxiety was situation-specific and manageable, only surfacing during events like presentations. this suggests that their anxiety was within a normal range and did not interfere with daily functioning. however, the recent change to experiencing heightened anxiety for everyday activities signals a substantial increase in stress levels. this progression from occasional to pervasive anxiety is a key indicator of stress. the phrase ""developed into a new level"" implies a notable escalation, and the use of ""so damn anxious"" emphasizes the intensity of their current emotional state. these aspects collectively point to an individual grappling with heightened stress, as their anxiety has become a persistent and disruptive force in their daily life."
"Instead he followed me to the store in his car. He would even drive slow enough to have the car next to me at all times. During one of our fights he took a permanent marker and slashed lines all over me while telling me ""how does that feel, you slut?"" He walked away and I just fell to the floor in tears. He came back and poured his Gatorade all over me telling me to shut up and stop crying so loud.",1,"the narrative describes a series of distressing and abusive events that are clear indicators of significant stress. the individual recounts being followed and monitored, which suggests a lack of personal freedom and a constant state of vigilance. the physical assault with a permanent marker and the accompanying verbal abuse highlight experiences of humiliation and degradation, both of which are potent sources of psychological trauma. the reaction of falling to the floor in tears demonstrates a moment of overwhelming emotional breakdown, a common response to acute stress and abuse. the subsequent act of having gatorade poured over them while being told to stop crying further emphasizes the presence of an environment that is not only unsupportive but actively harmful. these elements collectively point to a situation characterized by intense emotional distress and a sense of powerlessness, which are hallmark indicators of someone experiencing high levels of stress."
I was not allowed to talk to anyone. I was not even allowed to be on Facebook. Erik made me feel like a prisoner. When i had the Facebook app my phone would always get this random pop up notification saying my login has expired but I was never even logging in because I was too scared of what Erik would do to me. I was only allowed to safely be on my phone while I was next to him and only if I was doing something like reading or watching videos.,1,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels severely restricted and controlled by another person, erik. the mention of not being allowed to talk to anyone or use social media like facebook highlights social isolation, which is a common stressor. the individual expresses fear of repercussions from erik, indicating a high level of anxiety and stress. the description of feeling like a prisoner suggests a significant loss of autonomy and freedom, further contributing to psychological distress. the need to use the phone only in erik's presence and for specific activities indicates constant surveillance and a lack of personal space, both of which are strong indicators of a stressful environment. these elements collectively illustrate a scenario where the individual is under considerable stress due to controlling and oppressive behavior from erik."
"Before I could tell Erik we should go outside he threw me back onto the bed saying, ""yeah, you will make a deal. You will show me everything that you do behind my back, you fucking liar. You are always on your phone talking to guys and now you will show me everything!"" Erik had me on my bed laying pushed against the wall while he laid down on me with his full body weight. His body is so big and heavy it was making it harder and harder for me to breath as he was crushing me.",1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing and traumatic situation involving physical and emotional abuse. the author recounts being physically overpowered and verbally assaulted by erik, who accuses them of dishonesty and infidelity. specific examples, such as being thrown onto the bed and pinned down with erik's full body weight, highlight a sense of helplessness and fear. the language used, including phrases like ""you fucking liar"" and ""crushing me,"" conveys intense emotional turmoil and a lack of safety. these elements are typical indicators of acute stress and trauma, as the author experiences both physical danger and psychological abuse. the overwhelming sense of being trapped and the inability to breathe further emphasize the severity of the stress experienced in this situation."
"He kept the pressure on my throat and I felt as if I was going to die or become unconscious. Erik finally let go only to hit me in my head a few times. I felt very scared from not being able to breath. Every time I tried begging Erik to stop he told me to shut up, that I was not allowed to talk. Erik used my hair as handles to bash my head on the wall at several different times throughout the attack.",1,"the narrative describes a traumatic and violent encounter, which is indicative of a high-stress situation. the individual recounts a physical assault involving choking, hitting, and head bashing, which are all severe stressors. the feelings of fear, helplessness, and the inability to breathe contribute to a heightened state of distress. the repeated attempts to plead for the violence to stop, only to be silenced and further assaulted, exacerbate the sense of terror and loss of control. such experiences are known to trigger acute stress responses and can lead to long-term psychological impacts such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and depression. the detailed recounting of the physical and emotional abuse highlights the intense and overwhelming nature of the stress experienced."
My siblings and I went through a lot growing up. You would think it would have made us close but for some reason we were never close. For some reason I was the most outcast-ed. To this day if I were to bring up the childhood abuse they would tell me that I am dramatic and that it wasn't THAT bad. They will even say they respect Jay.,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress stemming from unresolved familial trauma and feelings of isolation. the author mentions a history of childhood abuse, which is a substantial source of long-term psychological stress. the lack of closeness with siblings, despite shared experiences, suggests a profound sense of alienation and loneliness. the author also describes being outcasted within the family, which can exacerbate feelings of worthlessness and contribute to ongoing emotional distress. the dismissal of the author's experiences by their siblings, who label them as dramatic, invalidates their feelings and experiences, further intensifying their stress. the mention of respecting jay, potentially an abuser or someone complicit, adds another layer of betrayal and conflict, making it clear why the individual is experiencing significant stress."
"I laid there terrified not knowing what was going to happen. Not knowing when, or if, it was going to stop I was fighting back tears because I knew I had to keep trying to out smart him in order to protect myself and make Erik stop attacking me. When I fell onto the futon I landed on Erik's new hat that he bought when he was out earlier that day. As another tactic to calm Erik down, I asked Erik if he could show me his new hat. He stood there angry for a few seconds before answering yes.",1,"the narrative describes a situation filled with fear and uncertainty, which are strong indicators of stress. the author expresses terror and the struggle to control emotions, such as fighting back tears. the need to outsmart someone to protect oneself highlights a high-stress environment where the individual feels threatened. the specific mention of trying to calm erik down and the strategic thinking involved in asking about the hat further illustrate the tense and stressful circumstances. the overall context of attempting to manage a potentially dangerous situation while under duress is a clear sign of significant stress."
As of Sunday i have experience sever anxiety. Its too the point i am unable to do normal everyday functions and doing my job is harder. All i can think about is how i was ripped away from my daughter and how she is without me. Its to the point my therapist uas suggested i used cbd oil to manage my anxiety instead of narcotics. They help take the edge off and let me relax to the point i can sleep.,1,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing severe anxiety, which is a clear indicator of stress. the person mentions being unable to perform normal everyday functions and finding it difficult to do their job, both of which are common signs of stress impacting daily life. the persistent thoughts about being separated from their daughter suggest an ongoing emotional distress that contributes to their anxiety. the fact that their therapist recommended cbd oil to manage anxiety, rather than narcotics, underscores the severity of their condition and the need for intervention. the mention of cbd oil helping to take the edge off and allowing the person to relax enough to sleep highlights the physical manifestations of stress, such as difficulty sleeping. these elements collectively point to a state of significant stress and anxiety."
"I've been renting since university and I'm getting sick of seeing the same amount of money I'd pay towards a mortgage go into the pocket of someone else. I have a junior role in the company, it's going somewhere (I hope) but not fast. I find financially I'm staying basically cash-neutral and my quality of life isn't brilliant. I'm not managing to save anything. I've been thinking that I should get a house with the money I inherited.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with the current financial situation, but it lacks the acute signs of stress. the author discusses practical concerns such as renting versus owning a home, career progression, and financial stability. however, the tone remains relatively calm and rational. the mention of hope for career advancement and consideration of using an inheritance to buy a house indicates proactive thinking and problem-solving, rather than being overwhelmed by stress. the narrative is focused on long-term goals and financial planning, which suggests a level of control and forward-thinking, typical of someone not experiencing significant stress."
"What can I do best to support her? Are there resources on this? I don't want to simply badger her to leave. I've tried to point her to better resources than me, but I'm not having much luck. I'm worried for her life.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of concern and anxiety, which are typical indicators of stress. the author is clearly worried about another person's well-being, which can be a significant source of stress. phrases like ""i am worried for her life"" and ""i do not want to simply badger her to leave"" suggest a sense of helplessness and urgency. the repeated questioning about how to support and the mention of unsuccessful attempts to find better resources indicate a persistent and unresolved worry. this ongoing stress is evident in the author's focus on the potential danger and their emotional investment in finding a solution."
"So in the past two weeks, I’ve been supporting my dad through some mental health things, I’ve been having trouble at work, my Nanna got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and to top it off, my boyfriend broke up with me two days ago.I work full time and I’m also at uni, which I’m falling behind in. Whatever I do, I cannot concentrate on anything and just fall into an absolute panic when I have a second to think. I feel so nauseous that I can’t eat. And I’m bursting into tears randomly. Can you suggest some coping strategies that you use to stop the constant cycle of negative thoughts?",1,"the narrative describes a series of significant life stressors, including supporting a family member with mental health issues, dealing with trouble at work, coping with a family member's serious medical diagnosis, and experiencing a recent breakup. the individual also mentions the added pressures of balancing full-time work and university, with an acknowledgment of falling behind in their studies. the narrative highlights a range of emotional and physical symptoms commonly associated with stress, such as difficulty concentrating, panic, nausea, loss of appetite, and random episodes of crying. these symptoms are indicative of a high level of distress, suggesting that the individual is overwhelmed by their current circumstances. the request for coping strategies to manage negative thoughts further underscores the individual's struggle to maintain mental well-being amidst these challenges."
"He broke up with me, accused me of lying about my cousin, saying he never heard of her despite the fact he has. I ended up sleeping with my friend that night. Then there was the issue with him threatening to hide my belongings with an unnamed friend. I wouldn't get to know who. A whole bunch of crazy ensued.",0,"the narrative describes a series of tumultuous events, including a breakup, accusations, and threats. while these events are undoubtedly chaotic, the tone of the narrative seems more focused on recounting the incidents rather than expressing ongoing emotional distress. the mention of sleeping with a friend the same night suggests a coping mechanism that might indicate resilience rather than stress. the term ""a whole bunch of crazy ensued"" implies a certain detachment or even a sense of humor about the situation, which is not typical of someone currently overwhelmed by stress. overall, the narrative lacks the introspective or emotional depth often seen in individuals experiencing significant stress."
"I asked him what happened to his hand, and he told me that the hood of his car slammed down on it but he's fine. When we got home Jude pulled me to the side and told me Coop is not fine. He told me Coop can't move it at all and it's a problem. Coop doesn't like doctors. He looks at Doctors and Nurses like they're the Grimm Reaper or something.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving coop's injured hand and his aversion to medical professionals. despite the injury, coop's reaction and the description of the event lack elements typically associated with stress. there is no mention of overwhelming emotions, feelings of being unable to cope, or any significant psychological distress. the focus is on the factual recounting of events and coop's dislike for doctors, which may indicate a general mistrust or fear rather than stress. jude's concern for coop adds a layer of seriousness to the injury but does not suggest that the narrator or coop is experiencing stress. the narrative maintains a calm and composed tone throughout, further supporting the absence of stress indicators."
I doubt and second guess myself a lot. I hesitate and fear picking up the phone. Fear coming off as too aggressive or too pushy or not sending the right person and Err On the side of not being aggressive enough. I’m afraid to take control as I fear ruining relationships etc. Last year i still did surprisingly well despite all this and even earned a rookie of the year title and won a trip.,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, such as persistent self-doubt and hesitation, which are common signs of anxiety and stress-related conditions. the author frequently mentions second-guessing themselves and fearing various social interactions, like picking up the phone or being perceived as too aggressive. this constant worry about others' perceptions and the fear of ruining relationships suggest an ongoing internal struggle and heightened sensitivity to social dynamics. despite their achievements, such as earning a rookie of the year title and winning a trip, the underlying anxiety remains evident. this juxtaposition of success and persistent fear can indicate that the stress is not alleviated by external accomplishments, which is a typical sign of deeper, ongoing stress."
"However, his fits of anger kept going at the smallest things such as eating the rest of the corn chips or even mentioning politics that he doesn't agree with. This went on at the same rate of once a month or so until I turned 16, which is when I noticed that it probably wasn't normal. One occurrence of this was when I was trying to buy a pair of sunglasses, but needed to use his paypal as where I'm from you need to be over 18. This for whatever reason ended in him exploding in rage again, because he couldn't remember his password. He left the room, and grabbed me by the throat when he came back.",1,"the narrative describes frequent and intense fits of anger triggered by minor incidents, such as eating corn chips or discussing politics, which are not typically expected to provoke such extreme reactions. the narrator notes that these episodes occurred regularly and continued until they were 16, at which point they began to recognize the abnormality of the behavior. a specific incident is recounted where a request to use paypal led to an explosive reaction and physical aggression, with the individual grabbing the narrator by the throat. this pattern of disproportionate anger and physical violence indicates a highly stressful environment, likely contributing to significant emotional and psychological distress for the narrator. the unpredictability and severity of these reactions are classic indicators of a stressful and potentially traumatic situation."
"Then he didn't talk to me for day and after that suddenly he pretends like nothing ever happened. He also tries to tell me that I remember things wrong in these fights, and that I am the one who always starts them. Last night this happened again, until he said some things that I don't feel are possible to take back, like telling me I am a loser and all of my friends hate me because I'm an a#$hole, and that he regretted bringing me up. I feel that crossed a line, due to the fact that this argument started because he told me when I was barbecuing sausages not to put the lid down, even though that's the way I always do it. He then proceeds to tell me my memories of cooking sausages have never happened, and then starts the fight/argument.",1,"the narrative reflects significant interpersonal conflict and emotional turmoil, which are strong indicators of stress. the recounting of arguments and accusations, particularly those involving personal attacks and gaslighting, suggest a high level of distress. the writer describes a situation where their actions and memories are consistently invalidated, leading to feelings of frustration and self-doubt. the mention of harsh words and irreversible statements, such as being called a loser and having friends who supposedly hate them, exacerbates the emotional impact. the detail about the argument starting over something as trivial as barbecuing sausages highlights the underlying tension and potential for escalation in their interactions. these elements collectively point to a state of chronic stress and emotional strain."
"Then I came home. My Mom pointed it out first, I went from being the class clown and the life of the party, to being the quiet guy who stood in the corner of the room. I went from a musician and avid gamer, to having no interest in any of it, and no replacement hobby. The things I had the most passion for in life were gone. It was like someone removed one of my five senses and my soul at the same time.",1,"the narrative describes a significant shift in behavior and interests, which are common indicators of stress. the person mentions a noticeable change in their social interactions, going from being outgoing and lively to withdrawn and quiet. this sudden change in social behavior can be a red flag for underlying stress or emotional distress. additionally, the loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, such as music and gaming, suggests anhedonia, a symptom often associated with stress and depression. the metaphor of losing a sense and their soul simultaneously emphasizes the depth of their emotional turmoil and sense of loss. these elements collectively point to a state of high stress, as they reflect a profound change in the individual's mental and emotional well-being."
"in the end i just end up leaving, ignoring the question or just saying something like ""haha, i'm not really interested in that sort of thing"" or whatever. that's all fine i guess, but what really pisses me off is when people act like it's some kind of status symbol to be sexually active (we are 18, ok.) and treat you like an immature loser if you aren't. wish i'd known that it was cool and a good thing back when i was being abused, it could have given me some playground cred or something instead of a lifetime of trauma processing. lol! i know my anger isn't justified, that their intention is not to be offensive or rude, that i'm being petty and immature and that i shouldn't take offense from these typical teenage status things but sometimes i just want to tell people about all the horrible things i went through so they will shut the fuck up and leave me alone.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of distress and frustration. the individual expresses feelings of anger and resentment towards societal norms and peer behavior regarding sexual activity. they mention past trauma and the long-lasting impact it has had on their mental health, indicating unresolved issues and ongoing emotional pain. the use of sarcasm and dismissive language, such as ""haha"" and ""lol,"" suggests an attempt to mask deeper hurt and discomfort. the internal conflict is evident as they acknowledge that their anger may not be justified and recognize their reactions as potentially petty or immature. however, the intensity of their emotions and the desire to be left alone highlight a struggle with stress and coping mechanisms. the narrative contains clear indicators of stress, including references to past abuse, ongoing trauma processing, and emotional turmoil related to social interactions and personal history."
"That's it. My mom made me delete it and said ""that's what is wrong with your generation, you act too grown."" Nothing about my picture was ""grown"" I was actually wearing a long white t shirt and boyfriend jeans. Even when we go to the beach with my siblings, me and my sister were wearing the exact same bikini and she said something to me about ""needing to sit my fast tailed butt down."" Mind you, my sister is two years younger than me and the bikinis weren't even provocative in a bikini sense.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes a situation where their actions and attire are unfairly criticized by their mother, which could contribute to feelings of frustration and misunderstanding. the repeated instances of being singled out, despite behaving similarly to their sibling, suggest a sense of unfair treatment and possibly feeling unsupported or judged. the use of quotes from the mother indicates specific moments of tension and conflict, which are common stressors. additionally, the individual's need to justify their clothing choices and the comparison with their younger sister further highlight feelings of inadequacy and stress. the context of familial expectations and criticism, especially when perceived as unjust, is a typical indicator of stress, as it can lead to internal conflict and emotional strain."
"He blames me. He's wrong. [This is what my spine looks <url> I've got Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which is a genetic connective tissue disorder that makes faulty collagen everywhere in my body, so my muscles are always in pain trying to keep my body in place (and have clearly failed in that regard). I've had symptoms all my life.",1,"the narrative indicates a high level of stress, primarily due to the chronic health condition mentioned. the individual describes a persistent and painful experience with ehlers danlos syndrome, which is known to cause significant physical discomfort and can lead to psychological distress. the mention of being blamed and feeling wrongly accused adds an emotional layer of stress, suggesting feelings of frustration and helplessness. chronic illness often exacerbates stress due to ongoing pain and the constant need for medical management, which can be mentally and emotionally draining. the detailed description of their symptoms and the impact on their daily life underscores the pervasive nature of their condition, further highlighting the stress they are under."
"However, I can't kick the Lyme. None of the specialists who treat Chronic Lyme are covered by insurance (because it isn't recognized by the CDC), and I'm so broke I can't justify buying myself hot food not covered by Food Stamps, let alone seeing a doctor I'd have to pay out of pocket. I'm terribly afraid of getting spinal fusion while still being this saturated with Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease gets much worse if it gets in your spinal column and brain, and getting myself all cut up for surgery with Lyme in my system..... I'm afraid I'll get worse.",1,"the narrative reflects significant stress as the author describes their ongoing struggle with chronic lyme disease, which is not recognized by the cdc, thus complicating their access to affordable treatment. the financial strain is evident, with the author mentioning their inability to afford hot food or pay for a specialist out of pocket. the fear of undergoing spinal fusion surgery while still battling lyme disease adds to their anxiety, particularly the concern that the disease could worsen if it reaches their spinal column and brain. these elements—financial hardship, health concerns, and fear of worsening conditions—are clear indicators of stress."
"All of my money goes to rent, utilities, and credit cards, and delivery food a few times a month when I'm too beat to cook. My boyfriend was nearly broke as me, and was leaning on my credit and foodstamps from time to time, leaving me in significant debt. We are breaking up after five years, because my pelvic organs are collapsing downwards, making for painful sex. He hung in there for three years of sexlessness, so I can't fault him.... but he's leaving in the next few months as soon as he gets the money to move out. I've got to figure my shit out.",1,"the narrative reveals significant financial strain, as the author mentions that all their money goes towards essential expenses like rent, utilities, and credit cards, leaving little for discretionary spending. the mention of relying on delivery food due to exhaustion from cooking further underscores a sense of being overwhelmed. the relationship aspect adds another layer of stress, with the boyfriend being nearly as broke and occasionally depending on the author's resources, contributing to financial debt. the breakup after five years, particularly due to a painful medical condition, introduces emotional and physical stress. the author acknowledges the boyfriend's patience but is faced with the impending challenge of managing everything alone once he moves out. the phrase ""i've got to figure my shit out"" encapsulates the overall sense of urgency and pressure to address multiple life stressors simultaneously."
"(I travel between NJ to NYC often, and $2.75 each way is pretty expensive. NJ and NYC both have Disabled rates for public transport, but the PATH which travels in-between, does not. It's total bullshit.) A free place to live in NYC? A bold plea, I realize.",0,"the narrative discusses the financial burden of commuting between new jersey and new york city, particularly highlighting the lack of discounted rates for disabled individuals on the path train. while the author expresses frustration over this issue, the tone and content do not suggest a deeper, pervasive sense of stress. the use of strong language like ""total bullshit"" indicates irritation, but it lacks the emotional depth and breadth typically associated with stress. the narrative is focused on a specific grievance rather than a broader, more pervasive sense of distress. additionally, the mention of seeking a free place to live in nyc comes off as a bold, somewhat humorous plea rather than a desperate cry for help. the overall context and examples provided suggest a momentary frustration rather than an ongoing state of stress."
"Holy crap, this is long. Migraine ramble. Thanks to any who have read all of this. I can give verification of my claims to anyone who needs it. (EDITED TO ADD: wishlist link above.)",0,"the narrative appears to be more of a casual, perhaps slightly frustrated, commentary rather than an expression of stress. the use of ""holy crap"" and ""migraine ramble"" suggests a tone of exasperation, but not necessarily stress. the writer acknowledges the length of their message and thanks the readers, indicating a level of awareness and courtesy that is not typically present in highly stressed individuals. offering verification of their claims and mentioning a wishlist link also implies that the writer is organized and has a clear purpose, which contrasts with the disorganized thought patterns often seen in stressed individuals. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, emotional distress, and cognitive overload that are common indicators of stress."
"Hey everyone. Been subbed for a long time and a lot of you guys helped me realize a few things so I thought I can try to help back. I’ve been dealing with anxiety/depression for a long time and never really done anything to deal with it. (Family didn’t really believe in that kind of stuff back in the day) I always believed that I had a passion for extreme sports like skydiving, water rafting etc etc. which is one of the reasons I believe I have anxiety maybe (adrenal produces slightly more adrenaline causing my body to be in a constant flight or fight state).",0,"the narrative describes the author's long-term struggle with anxiety and depression, but it does not convey an immediate sense of distress or crisis. the individual shares their experience calmly and rationally, reflecting on their past and possible reasons for their mental state, such as a passion for extreme sports and the associated adrenaline rush. the tone is introspective and informative rather than frantic or overwhelmed. they also mention their family's disbelief in mental health issues without expressing significant frustration or helplessness. these elements suggest a level of acceptance and understanding rather than acute stress."
Yet no matter what I do the feeling of unwantedness and just pure hopelessness never fades. I don't really know what I'm doing anymore. Is there anywhere out there where I can just pack my stuff and live alone? Is there someone I can talk to about all this or some kind of help for things like this? I'm currently alone and have no one to talk about any of this.,1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of stress. the persistent feeling of unwantedness and hopelessness mentioned is a significant red flag, as these emotions are often associated with high levels of psychological distress. the individual expresses confusion about their actions and a desire to escape, suggesting a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to cope with their current situation. the repeated questioning about finding a place to live alone or seeking someone to talk to indicates a profound sense of isolation and a desperate need for support. the mention of being currently alone and having no one to talk to further underscores the depth of their loneliness and social disconnection, both of which are common in individuals experiencing significant stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone struggling with severe emotional turmoil and a lack of social support, which are critical factors in understanding their stressed state."
"I'm currently between jobs and looking to make money in any way I can, so I was wondering if anyone would be interested in buying a cross stitch commission from me. I can do any type of pattern or design, in various sizes. Here are some examples of things I've made: <url> I would really appreciate any help I can get! Times are rough and my mental health is not great right now, so it would be nice to have something to work on that would also help me pay my bills and medical expenses!",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the individual's precarious financial situation and the impact it has on their mental health. the mention of being ""between jobs"" and the need to ""make money in any way i can"" highlights economic instability, a common stressor. the plea for help and the offer to sell cross stitch commissions underscore a sense of urgency and desperation. phrases like ""times are rough"" and ""my mental health is not great right now"" explicitly convey emotional distress. the desire for work that could also help pay bills and medical expenses further emphasizes the pressure the individual is under. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with significant stressors related to financial insecurity and its toll on their well-being."
"Hey everybody. I'm not really sure else where else to possibly post this.

I don't know what to do but I can't keep doing this.,1,"the narrative displays several indicators typical of someone experiencing significant stress. the mention of suicidal thoughts is a serious sign of mental distress, suggesting feelings of hopelessness and despair. the writer also expresses fear and uncertainty about the future, particularly regarding starting college, which can be a major life stressor. the lack of sleep for almost two days is another critical factor, as sleep deprivation can exacerbate stress and impair cognitive functioning, leading to difficulties in thinking clearly. the overall tone of the narrative conveys a sense of overwhelming anxiety and an inability to cope with current circumstances, which are all relevant psychological insights pointing to a state of high stress."
"Hi! I live in an apartment block. There are 6 door entrances within a 5 meter proximity, so we can hear our neighbours slightly if they're very loud. I live next to an asian women I've never seen before. I don't know if she lives alone.",0,"the narrative describes a living situation in an apartment block where the proximity of neighbors is mentioned, but there are no indicators of stress. the author calmly describes the layout and mentions being able to hear neighbors if they are very loud, but there is no expression of discomfort, anxiety, or distress about this situation. the mention of an unknown neighbor is presented as a neutral fact rather than a source of worry or concern. the tone is straightforward and lacks emotional intensity, which suggests a lack of stress-related symptoms. overall, the narrative does not include elements typically associated with stress, such as heightened emotional responses, negative thoughts, or expressions of feeling overwhelmed."
For me it would start with rent. We got approved for an apartment but some shit happened and we don’t have 1st months anymore so we can’t move in. We still have time to come up with it but I doubt we will before the deadline. After we got that I have an employment opportunity lined up but I can’t start the job until after the baby so I’d just have to manage to keep the rent paid until Dec which would be after due date and minimum recovery time. After that I’d just need to make sure I had some decent savings up by then to get everything I’d need to start the gig.,0,"the narrative describes a series of logistical and financial challenges, including issues with rent, an impending move, a new job opportunity, and the arrival of a baby. while these situations could be stressful, the tone of the narrative remains relatively pragmatic and solution-focused. the author outlines the steps they need to take and acknowledges the difficulties without expressing overwhelming anxiety or hopelessness. this practical approach, coupled with the absence of emotional distress or negative self-talk, suggests that the individual is managing the situation without significant stress. their ability to plan and think ahead, even when facing obstacles, indicates a level of resilience and coping capability that is not typically associated with high stress levels."
"I hate that I am this way--I have a normal job, but all that has rotted away because out of the past 2 years, I spent 7 of those months in various hospitals and treatment using FMLA unpaid. I have so many fucking medical bills sitting in collections. I still have my job thanks to FMLA, but I am a rotting piece of shit living life minute by minute, losing a war against addiction and depression and anxiety. But...I somehow manage to ""look fine"" and I look like I should be thriving on paper. I feel like such a fraud, but I swear I am not trying to take advantage of the system or anything.",1,"the narrative reveals significant distress and emotional turmoil. the individual expresses self-loathing and frustration, evident in phrases like ""i hate that i am this way"" and ""rotting piece of shit."" the mention of extensive hospitalizations and reliance on fmla indicates serious health issues, contributing to stress. the accumulation of medical bills in collections further exacerbates financial strain. the person battles addiction, depression, and anxiety, highlighting multiple layers of psychological distress. despite outward appearances of normalcy, the internal struggle is profound, leading to feelings of fraudulence and a sense of losing control. these elements collectively signify a high level of stress and emotional suffering."
"Good news is that my application for public housing was accepted. Bad news is that it will take up to six months for anything to open up for me. More bad news is that I didn’t know until today that my friend had to report me living with her to her landlady as soon as possible, and because she waited so long I am an unauthorized guest. So I have to be out today. I think I have a place to go, but I just feel like I’ve sort of hit a wall.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the writer mentions both positive and negative events, but the focus quickly shifts to the negative consequences. the good news about the housing application is overshadowed by the six-month wait and the immediate need to vacate their current living situation due to being an unauthorized guest. this abrupt change and uncertainty about where to go next are significant stressors. the phrase ""i just feel like ive sort of hit a wall"" suggests a sense of overwhelm and emotional exhaustion. the rapid succession of problems and the urgency of finding a new place to stay today contribute to a heightened state of stress. these elements are typical indicators of stress as they reflect feelings of instability, pressure, and a lack of control over one's circumstances."
"I'll call him out on his behavior or try to stand up for myself, and then he'll either get mad and give me the silent treatment and not apologize, or he'll tell me I'm lying and that he didn't do or say something. Even though I know he did. He criticizes my parenting and tells me I'm lazy since I'm a SAHM (even though I do all the cleaning, cooking, taking care of our toddler, taking care of our pets and anything else around the house with little help from him because he feels entitled to not do anything since he works and I don't). To top it all off, he doesn't think he has a drinking problem... yet always drinks at least 3 beers or more every night. He also slapped my son and left a mark on his face while we were camping (I didn't see him do it because I went to go pee but saw it and asked about it when I got back).",1,"the narrative reveals multiple stress indicators, primarily stemming from interpersonal conflict and emotional abuse. the individual describes a pattern of invalidation and gaslighting from their partner, which is a significant source of psychological distress. the partner's behavior includes giving the silent treatment, denying actions, and making derogatory comments about the individual's parenting and contributions as a stay-at-home parent. these actions undermine the individual's self-esteem and sense of worth. additionally, the partner's drinking habits and the incident of physical aggression towards their child further contribute to an environment of fear and anxiety. the cumulative effect of these stressors—emotional abuse, criticism, lack of support, and witnessing or knowing about harm to a child—are typical indicators of significant stress."
"Now he is enraged because I said months ago that maybe internet access was not a bad idea, that there was some stuff there that may connect him more to others. He had been asking for months how to access the internet for free, and I just did not know what to say, he mentioned it so much, besides he would have to get internet access from a company if he wanted to use the internet reliably. So he did that at some point, and is now having issues. It just looks like an older man who is having difficulty navigating the internet and who finds Apple care unhelpful. But he is phoning me today yelling and accusing me of paranoid stuff and hanging up.",1,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is dealing with an individual who is experiencing significant frustration and anger. the mention of the person being enraged, yelling, and accusing the author of paranoid stuff are strong indicators of emotional distress. the difficulty in navigating the internet and the dissatisfaction with customer support, coupled with the persistent requests for help, suggest a buildup of frustration. the author's reference to the older man's struggle with technology and the subsequent blame directed at them indicates a stressful dynamic. these elements, including the escalation to yelling and accusations, highlight a high-stress environment for both parties involved."
"I knew I was unhappy in this relationship. He has a very impulsive personality, he destroys his property and overdoses on drugs when he is angry. When I was telling him that I needed some time on my own, he would threaten to kill himself so that I felt obligated to come take care of him (happened 2 times). I would stay because I felt I had the moral obligation to make sure he is okay. I felt very manipulated.",1,"the narrative describes a relationship fraught with significant emotional turmoil and manipulation, which are strong indicators of stress. the individual acknowledges unhappiness and the partner's impulsive behavior, including property destruction and drug overdoses, which create a volatile and unpredictable environment. the threats of suicide used to manipulate the narrator into staying further exacerbate the stress, as they feel morally obligated to ensure the partner's safety despite their own need for personal space. this sense of manipulation and moral conflict contributes to an ongoing, intense emotional burden, highlighting the chronic stress experienced in the relationship."
"So something happened over 3 years ago that caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety, and over the past few months the anxiety surrounding that event has come back? It doesn't make sense, I can't rationalize it either. This time around it's not as intense as it was then but I'm definitely experiencing the same thoughts, same anxiety. What the f do I do? I don't feel comfortable at all talking about it with a therapist and it's began consuming my life again.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of stress. the individual mentions experiencing a ""tremendous amount of anxiety"" related to an event that occurred over three years ago, indicating a lingering impact on their mental health. the resurgence of anxiety in recent months, despite the passage of time, suggests that the issue remains unresolved and continues to affect their well-being. the person's inability to rationalize their feelings and the recurrence of the same anxious thoughts highlight a persistent struggle with stress. their discomfort with discussing the issue with a therapist further emphasizes the depth of their distress, as they feel isolated and unable to seek professional help. the phrase ""it has began consuming my life again"" indicates that the anxiety is significantly interfering with their daily functioning and overall quality of life. these elements collectively point to a state of ongoing stress and difficulty in managing their emotional responses to the past event."
"If he's the textbook abuser, she is the textbook victim. She keeps giving him chances and accepting his apologies and living in this cycle of abuse. She thinks she's the one doing something wrong.

I tell her she does not deserve this treatment.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where an individual is concerned about someone else's well-being rather than their own. the focus is on the behavior of a friend who is in an abusive relationship and the advice being given to her. while the situation is undoubtedly distressing, the person narrating does not exhibit signs of personal stress. instead, they are taking a proactive and supportive role, offering guidance and expressing concern for their friend's safety. the language used is clear and directive, without indications of personal turmoil or anxiety. typical indicators of stress, such as feelings of helplessness, overwhelming emotions, or self-doubt, are absent in the narrative. the narrator's composed and rational approach to addressing the issue further suggests a lack of personal stress."
"I thought why not try and look for a girl at the gym, but as you can figure, at 3:30am there's not as much fish in the see. Though I fear any partner not sharing my passion for fitness will not bear the strict diet I follow and the amount of time and energy I invest daily into the whole topic. #**TL;DR** ish And it is also not me wanting a girlfriend right now, do or die-esque. I am also way more interested in finding a girl sharing the same passions, aspiring to achieve similar goals, sharing the same values and providing a safe haven for one another long-term rather than just having some fun and being superficial about it.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and introspective individual who is clear about their values and aspirations in a partner. they express a desire for a meaningful and long-term relationship with someone who shares their passion for fitness and similar life goals. the mention of a strict diet and the dedication to fitness suggests a disciplined and goal-oriented mindset. while there is an acknowledgment of the challenges in finding such a partner, there is no indication of overwhelming anxiety or distress. instead, the tone remains calm and reasoned, focusing on compatibility and shared values rather than immediate concerns or pressures. this balanced perspective and absence of urgent emotional turmoil suggest a non-stressed state of mind."

"Every single day I think about what happened, and it scares me to this very day. My hands go numb all the time with loss of sensation and my muscles are tense 24/7 I have a hard time believing it's anxiety but it most likely is because I've never had panic attacks before that incident. I've been on one antidepressant (Zoloft) for 3 months, and it didn't do anything. I was prescribed Venlafaxine but I'm too scared to take it due to the side effects. So yeah that's my story",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators typical of an individual experiencing stress. the author describes persistent, intrusive thoughts about a past event, which is a common symptom of stress and anxiety disorders. the mention of physical symptoms such as numb hands and constant muscle tension further supports the presence of stress, as these are physical manifestations often associated with anxiety. the difficulty in accepting that these symptoms could be related to anxiety, despite the lack of prior panic attacks, indicates a struggle with understanding and managing their mental health. the mention of medication (zoloft) that did not alleviate symptoms and the fear of taking another prescribed medication (venlafaxine) due to potential side effects highlights ongoing distress and apprehension about treatment options. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress impacting the individual's daily life and mental well-being."

A very uncomfortable feeling in my chest.",1,"the narrative describes a person who is engaging in multiple healthy and stress-reducing activities such as meditation, jogging, and eating well. despite these positive behaviors and an overall satisfaction with life and passion, the individual reports experiencing random physical symptoms of anxiety, specifically mentioning an uncomfortable feeling in the chest. the absence of negative thoughts but the presence of physical symptoms like chest discomfort is a common manifestation of stress. this disconnect between a positive mental state and physical anxiety can be indicative of underlying stress that may not be immediately apparent through typical emotional or cognitive signs but is instead expressed somatically. the inconsistency between the individual's lifestyle and their physical symptoms highlights the complexity of stress, which can persist even when one is doing everything ""right"" to manage it."

After talking to a few close people, I have decided that I can’t sit around waiting for my rent to inevitably go up again, and that staying there means I can’t continue with school. But I’m having issues coming to terms with the fact that bf won’t come with me. He says he doesn’t want to abandon his mom, and that he has to help them any way he can (like now giving up 50% of his income).

They refuse to rent out the extra rooms to help.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the sudden and significant increase in financial obligations, from $250 to $500, without prior discussion, creates a sense of unpredictability and pressure. this abrupt change, coupled with the increased financial burden on the boyfriend as well, contributes to a heightened state of anxiety. the writer's status as a full-time student who already manages all her expenses, including school fees, exacerbates the situation. the backstory of potential foreclosure adds a layer of instability and insecurity, as the house's future is uncertain. the refusal of the boyfriend's mother and sister to rent out extra rooms, despite the financial strain, highlights a lack of support and cooperation, further intensifying the writer's stress. these elements collectively depict a scenario filled with financial strain, unpredictability, and lack of communal support, all of which are typical indicators of stress."

I explained my situation without giving him how long I’ve been homeless but said I’d be back on my feet by December. That was at the beginning of the conversation.

Last Thursday night I’m woken up by a cop banging on my window with his flashlight at 1:45am. He said he helped someone in the same parking lot a week prior find a place to live. I call bullshit on that.,1,"the narrative describes a prolonged period of homelessness, which is a significant stressor. the individual has been sleeping in their car for over three years, indicating a lack of stable housing and the associated insecurity and discomfort. the mention of a specific, consistent parking spot in a dark edge of a public lot suggests a need for safety and avoidance of attention, common behaviors in high-stress situations. the incident with the police officer adds to the stress, as being woken up in the middle of the night can be startling and distressing. the skepticism towards the officer's claim of helping someone else highlights a possible mistrust in authorities or a sense of hopelessness, which are psychological indicators of stress. overall, the narrative reflects ongoing challenges, uncertainty, and emotional strain typical of someone experiencing significant stress."

So I honestly don’t know what to do or how to go about this situation.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels isolated due to their friends being preoccupied with their own relationships or showing disinterest in hanging out. the absence of social clubs at their school limits opportunities to meet new people. despite expressing a desire to be part of a close-knit group, the tone of the narrative remains relatively calm and reflective rather than distressed. the individual is contemplating potential solutions and seeking ways to navigate their social environment, which indicates a level of coping and problem-solving rather than overwhelming stress. the language used is straightforward and lacks signs of emotional turmoil or urgency, which are typical indicators of stress. overall, the narrative reflects a thoughtful consideration of social challenges rather than an immediate emotional response."

But he's okay with it, so is it any of my business?",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving the writer's sister, who is openly exploring her feelings for another girl while still in a relationship with her boyfriend. the writer expresses concern about the fairness of this situation to the boyfriend, who appears to be very accommodating and unbothered by his girlfriend's actions. the sister's openness about her feelings and the boyfriend's passive acceptance are discussed, but there is no indication of significant distress or anxiety from the writer. instead, the tone suggests a level of acceptance and contemplation about whether or not to intervene. the writer's main concern seems to be about the ethics and fairness of the situation rather than any personal stress or emotional turmoil, which aligns with the classification."
"It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll.",1,"the narrative describes a situation filled with several stress indicators. the individual discusses their direct manager being overworked and the resulting last-minute scheduling, which suggests a chaotic and unpredictable work environment. the person also mentions not getting enough sleep, which is a common physical symptom of stress. another significant point is the difficulty in maintaining their medication regimen due to an unpredictable weekly schedule, highlighting a lack of control over their health management. these elements collectively point towards a high-stress environment, where both work-related pressures and personal health challenges are present. the unpredictability, lack of support, and physical symptoms such as sleep deprivation are all typical indicators of stress."
"That was about 7 hours ago. Normally, I do not get much effect from tea because I only ever drink half a cup as I don't like it that much. However, I have been feeling jittery all day and my heart periodically feels as though it is racing. I have that adrenalized and uneasy feeling that I always get with caffeine. It wasn't really bothering me because I knew it was probably from the caffeine.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual describes feeling jittery and having a racing heart, which are common physiological responses to stress. these symptoms suggest heightened arousal and activation of the sympathetic nervous system, often associated with stress. the mention of an ""adrenalized and uneasy feeling"" further underscores this state of heightened physiological alertness. while the person attributes these sensations to caffeine, the persistence of these feelings throughout the day, despite typically consuming only a small amount of tea, indicates a possible underlying stress response. the acknowledgment of these symptoms and the attempt to rationalize them suggest an awareness of their body's stress signals, which reinforces the classification."
"He was arrested for assault and battery and DWI. He took off with our infant daughter while inebriated and then returned and beat me down then left again. Why am I being made to feel like this is all my fault. The way he looked at me in the courtroom, like I did this, I didn’t even call the police?! The neighbors did after our children ran over to them screaming.",1,"the narrative reveals a deeply distressing situation characterized by significant emotional turmoil and trauma. the individual describes a series of alarming events, including an assault, the endangerment of their infant daughter, and the subsequent arrest of their partner. the mention of physical violence and the traumatic experience of being beaten down are clear indicators of a high-stress environment. furthermore, the individual's feelings of guilt and confusion about being blamed for the situation, despite not having called the police themselves, highlight a common psychological response to trauma known as self-blame. this reaction can exacerbate feelings of stress and anxiety. the observation of their partner's accusatory look in the courtroom further compounds their emotional distress, contributing to a pervasive sense of helplessness and victimization. these elements collectively underscore the intense psychological strain and stress the individual is experiencing."
"I tried everything at work, from doing meditation, office yoga, to getting a board to keep track of my tasks. Everyday seemed overwhelming, and I slowly started dreading my patient appointments and sometimes rushed through them because I could sense a panic attack coming on. To make matters worse, my supervisor is not the most understanding person. English is not her first language, and it's sometimes very hard to communicate with her in person or in email. I meet with her twice a month to discuss my progress and she never gives me positive feedback, only highlights things I've done wrong and things I don't do.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant workplace stress. the individual mentions trying various coping mechanisms such as meditation, office yoga, and task management boards, which indicates a proactive approach to managing stress. however, despite these efforts, they feel overwhelmed daily and have begun to dread their patient appointments, a clear sign of emotional and psychological strain. the mention of rushing through appointments due to impending panic attacks is a strong indicator of acute stress. additionally, the relationship with the supervisor exacerbates the situation; the supervisor's lack of understanding and failure to provide positive feedback contribute to the individual's feelings of inadequacy and frustration. the communication barrier with the supervisor adds another layer of stress, as it hinders effective interaction and support. these elements collectively illustrate a scenario where the individual is under considerable stress, struggling to cope with their responsibilities and lacking sufficient support in their work environment."
"Well maybe afraid isn't the best word, but it's not far off. I'm not worried they can physically harm me or anything, nor do I even hate kids, most kids I actually like, but certain kids, like uncle's girlfriend's one kids, make me uncomfortable and make my anxiety go off badly. He's like 6 or something like that, but he is disrespectful to me, and harasses me when I'm around. He'll make smart ass remarks which although typical small child insults, get to me, not because they hurt my feelings so much, but it gets to me that I'm so pathetic, I can't even demand respect from a fucking child. Today, playing some backyard cricket with my brother and other cousin (a very respectful kid who I love), he asks if he can peg the ball at my groin, to which I obviously say no, so what does he do?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily through the individual's descriptions of anxiety and discomfort around certain children. the person explicitly mentions that their anxiety ""goes off badly"" when interacting with their uncle's girlfriend's child, highlighting a significant emotional reaction. the use of phrases like ""make me uncomfortable"" and ""harasses me"" suggests ongoing distress and a sense of being targeted, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. the narrative also reflects a sense of self-criticism and frustration, particularly when the author describes feeling ""pathetic"" for not being able to command respect from a child. this internalization of perceived inadequacies is a common stress response, where individuals blame themselves for situations that are often beyond their control. the specific example of the child asking if he can throw a ball at the author's groin and then acting against the author's wishes underscores a lack of control and respect, further contributing to the author's stress. the comparison between this child and another ""very respectful kid"" also highlights the disparity in interactions, emphasizing the stress-inducing nature of the problematic child's behavior. overall, the narrative is rich with expressions of anxiety, self-doubt, and frustration, all of which are typical indicators of stress."
"Pretty normal life. My dad has been suffering of severe depression as long as I can remember, but he always refused to get help. I didn't notice as a child; but it wasn't as bad when I was younger. It really got bad a few years ago, when I was around 15. He gets angry at very little things and when he does, he closes off.",0,"the narrative describes a generally stable life, despite the presence of a significant stressor: the father's severe depression. the individual recounts their father's condition without expressing personal distress or overwhelming emotions. they mention not noticing the severity as a child, indicating a level of emotional resilience or detachment from the father's issues during their formative years. the narrative focuses more on observing the father's behavior rather than expressing personal turmoil or anxiety. although the father's anger and tendency to close off are mentioned, the narrative lacks indicators of the individual's own stress response, such as feelings of helplessness, constant worry, or impact on their daily functioning. the tone remains relatively calm and factual, which suggests that the writer is managing the situation without significant personal stress."
"This weekend she had a breakdown and gave me the following reasons: - I'm almost a momma's boy - My mom shares an unhealthy relationship with her children (my mom has admittedly told my gf a number of times that she makes her jealous and I care for another woman, but that's because my mom doesn't have a life outside our family and is understandable. My mom however cares for my gf, buys her presents, keeps in mind her allergies and cooks her food that she'd eat, so I don't get why my gf would have an issue) - Apparently it's weird that I spend all my time and don't like to hang out with friends",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author recounts a breakdown experienced by their girlfriend. the reasons given for the breakdown include concerns about the author's close relationship with their mother and the mother's behavior towards the girlfriend. despite these concerns, the author rationalizes their mother's actions as caring and understandable. the author also mentions that their girlfriend finds it odd that they prefer to spend time with family rather than friends. the tone of the narrative suggests a level of detachment and rationalization rather than emotional distress. the author appears to be more focused on justifying their own and their mother's behavior rather than expressing personal feelings of stress or anxiety. this detachment and rationalization are not typical indicators of someone experiencing significant stress, as they do not convey a sense of personal emotional turmoil or overwhelming concern. instead, the author seems to be analyzing the situation from a logical standpoint, which aligns with the absence of stress."
"When sis ""woke up"" as a teenager, she started raising hell about the singing evangelist father who'd held her by the wrist, telling her to ""watch and learn"" while her older sister was forced to copulate him. (Bro was hiding behind the clothes & sliding doors in the closet, watching through the crack.) Spouse had been threatened repeatedly with extinction (from the age of three until she was well-normalized at 13) to ""perform."" (Grampa got *his* turns, too.) Moreover, the perp beat and otherwise terrorized the mother into submission, and then manipulated her to get out of his way when my two step-daughters were left there by my dissociated spouse.",0,"the narrative details severe trauma and abuse experienced by multiple family members over an extended period. it describes physical and sexual abuse, manipulation, and psychological terror inflicted by a family member. while the content is undoubtedly distressing and involves significant trauma, it does not necessarily indicate that the author is currently experiencing stress. instead, the narrative could be a recounting of past events, possibly from a detached or clinical perspective. indicators of stress in a narrative typically include expressions of current emotional turmoil, anxiety, or behavioral symptoms directly linked to the present state of the author. in this case, the narrative focuses on past events without explicitly connecting them to the author's current emotional or psychological state. thus, while the described events are harrowing, the narrative lacks clear indicators of the author's present stress."
She referred me to a dermatologist who was known to treat white gay guys and other asian gay guys with genital warts. That's how gossipy these doctors can be. I went to this new dermatologist and showed her my growths. She then showed me pictures of genital warts from her textbook. They looked like cauliflowers.,0,"the narrative reflects a clinical and somewhat detached recounting of events. the individual describes being referred to a dermatologist and provides details about the dermatologist's reputation and the interaction during the appointment. the tone is factual and lacks emotional language or expressions of anxiety, fear, or frustration. the mention of doctors being gossipy is presented in a matter-of-fact manner rather than a distressed or agitated one. the description of the medical condition and the comparison to textbook images are clinical and descriptive without emotional embellishment. these elements suggest that the individual is not experiencing significant stress related to the events described, as there is an absence of typical stress indicators such as heightened emotional responses, catastrophizing, or preoccupation with negative outcomes."
"They looked nothing like my growths. She told me I was misdiagnosed. I didn't have an std. I had sebaceous epidermal cysts. Had I never had awful sex, then I would have never thought the growths on my scrotum were stds.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a medical misdiagnosis, where the individual initially believed they had an std but later learned they had sebaceous epidermal cysts. despite the potential for stress in such a scenario, the narrative is presented in a factual and resolved manner. the person recounts the events without expressing ongoing anxiety or distress. the tone is more reflective than emotionally charged, indicating that the issue has been addressed and resolved. the lack of emotional intensity or lingering worry suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress related to this situation."
"I was struggling to read the situation between us. My head was telling me she liked me but my anxiety was telling me I was wrong about this and not to pursue any sort of romantic relationship with her. I ended up getting a little drunk one night just before the new year and was texting her, I realised how much more at ease I was talking to her when I was drunk and that I quite liked her. I felt like I was being weird when I was sober too and i didn't like that. So I decided that instead of hiding my anxiety I would open up to her about it.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly in the context of social and romantic interactions. the author describes an internal conflict where their head and anxiety are at odds, suggesting a significant level of psychological tension. the mention of anxiety explicitly highlights a common symptom of stress, which is the persistent worry about social perceptions and outcomes. the reliance on alcohol to feel more at ease when communicating is another red flag, as it indicates a coping mechanism often used to manage stress. additionally, the author's discomfort with their sober behavior and the subsequent decision to disclose their anxiety to the other person underscores their struggle with managing stress in social situations. these elements collectively illustrate the presence of stress in the author's experiences and thought processes."
I always have to touch my face and trace my fingers along my body because it's so odd to know that I am real. That I am alive. I often now sit and think about what I am made of. How behind my skin is a complex make up of organs that keep my unique body and overly aware mind alive. I think how inside my skull is an organ that is thoroughly condensed and holds vast amounts of knowledge.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-awareness and introspection, which is not necessarily indicative of stress. the individual is contemplating their existence and the complexity of the human body and mind. this kind of philosophical musing, while profound, does not inherently suggest distress. instead, it shows a curiosity and fascination with one's own being. the repeated actions of touching their face and tracing their body could be seen as grounding techniques, which might be employed to enhance the sense of reality and presence rather than as signs of stress. the tone of the narrative is contemplative rather than anxious or distressed, focusing more on the marvel of human existence rather than any feelings of overwhelm or tension."
"Switching my major to something I’d actually enjoy would add in years to my education and everyone would be like “wtf you need to just commit and finish it because of the money you’ve paid and time etc” because it’s not like I’m 22 anymore or whatever. But I dream of a career involved in science, something morbid or outdoors. I feel like I’m too old to be indecisive. I want to start a family in the next couple f years but if I switch up this career stuff that’ll just push it back and I am almost 30 after all! :/",1,"the narrative exhibits several classic indicators of stress. the individual is grappling with significant life decisions, such as whether to switch majors, which could extend their education timeline and provoke societal judgment. this pressure is compounded by concerns over financial investments and age-related expectations. the person also expresses a desire for a science-related career and a family, yet feels constrained by time, highlighting an internal conflict between personal aspirations and perceived societal pressures. the mention of feeling ""too old to be indecisive"" and the anxiety over delaying family plans further underscore the stress associated with balancing career ambitions and personal life goals. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, driven by a sense of urgency, societal expectations, and the fear of missed opportunities."
"As a high school junior, I'm always severely depressed whenever I make poor grades on something to the extent I'm always on the verge of crying. Every time this happens, I always feel like my future is bleak and hopeless, my rank is gonna drop like hell, and I'm worthless compared to the other people who do better than me. I'm always driven to think lesser of myself in comparison to other people and I always hate myself because of it. Now the pain is becoming unbearable to the point I nearly start screaming, sobbing alone in my bedroom out of grief. It's only the beginning of my junior year and I feel like hell has already descended upon me and there's little I can actually do.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional distress and feelings of hopelessness. the individual expresses severe depression and self-deprecating thoughts related to academic performance, which are common indicators of stress. phrases like ""always on the verge of crying,"" ""my future is bleak and hopeless,"" and ""i am worthless compared to the other people"" highlight a pervasive sense of despair and inadequacy. the mention of physical manifestations of stress, such as ""nearly start screaming"" and ""sobbing alone in my bedroom out of grief,"" further underscores the intensity of their emotional turmoil. the overall tone conveys a deep sense of helplessness and suffering, suggesting a high level of stress and emotional strain."
"My job is very difficult to get, I know multiple people who drive two hours each way because it is the best job around (midwest). It isn't one I can just give up but every time he gets close I start to panic and I can't breathe. My anxiety is through the roof. The worst part is he tries to hit on me and it honestly makes me sick. Add in that I'm pregnant and my hormones are through the roof, I just don't know what to do any advice?",1,"the narrative contains several clear indicators of stress. the author describes their job as difficult to obtain and implies a high level of commitment and necessity to keep it, which can inherently contribute to stress. the mention of a long commute by others highlights the job's perceived value, adding pressure not to leave it. the author explicitly states experiencing panic and difficulty breathing, both physical symptoms of acute stress and anxiety. the mention of high anxiety levels further confirms this. an additional source of stress is the inappropriate behavior of a colleague, which is described as making the author feel sick, indicating a strong negative emotional response. the author is also pregnant, a condition known to cause significant hormonal changes and emotional fluctuations, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. overall, the narrative reflects a confluence of work-related pressures, personal safety concerns, and physiological changes, all of which are typical indicators of a high-stress situation."
"I don't remember always being like this, but over the last two years or so I have had a few tumultuous friendships/dating connections with people (I make deep connections quickly, or seemingly deep anyways with lots of self disclosure and vice versa) and after things don't work out I feel like I am lost and won't be able to cope on my own. I recently started talking to someone again after not talking to them for a few months, there was no bad blood between us we just decided it would be best to move on and not talk anymore. They reached out first about a month ago, then nothing. I have been going through it at work, feeling overwhelmed and anxious and so I feel stupid for doing this but I began talking to them again. I feel better, even if its slight.",0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on their experiences with relationships and their emotional responses. they mention having tumultuous friendships and dating connections over the past two years, which suggests a pattern of intense but short-lived relationships. despite these challenges, the person appears to have some self-awareness and insight into their feelings. they acknowledge feeling lost and unable to cope when relationships end, but also note that there was no bad blood with a recent connection, indicating a level of emotional maturity and the ability to maintain civility. the person also mentions feeling overwhelmed and anxious at work, which are common stress indicators, but they find solace in rekindling communication with an old acquaintance. this action leads to a slight improvement in their mood, suggesting that they are actively seeking ways to manage their feelings and find support. overall, while there are elements of stress in their narrative, the person's ability to reflect, maintain positive connections, and seek support are indicators of resilience and coping mechanisms that mitigate the overall impact of stress."
"But unfortunately it's so easy to lie. I really want to ask people who are on this subreddit, has this ever happened to you personally? Is it possible that someone actually catches feelings through the internet? Every comment would be truly appreciated. P.S: I'm sure he isn't a catfish, I wanted to share as little information as possible but if you really want to know you can PM me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of curiosity and concern about online interactions, but it does not exhibit signs of stress. the individual expresses a desire to understand if others have experienced similar situations and seeks validation or advice. while there is a mention of lying, it is presented in a general context rather than indicating personal distress. the tone is inquisitive rather than anxious or overwhelmed, and the writer is open to engaging with others for further information. the mention of ensuring someone isn't a catfish suggests caution but not paranoia or significant stress. overall, the narrative lacks the urgency, negative emotional language, or cognitive distortions that are typically associated with stress."
"It was hard on me. I let her know it but I also let her know I do it because I love her. She seemed to have an issue with me expressing myself. With stress from the school directly into the job itself she became distant. Less and less texting, feeling no need to communicate, moments of depression which she suffers from, low self esteem, her mom becoming ill and needing hip replacement at age 74 and not doing well following the surgery.",1,"the narrative reflects multiple indicators of stress. the author describes personal difficulties, such as the strain of expressing emotions and the challenges of maintaining communication with a loved one. the mention of school and job-related stress adds to the overall burden. the narrative also highlights the loved one's struggles with depression and low self-esteem, further compounding the stress experienced by the author. the added concern for the loved one's mother's health and her complications post-surgery exacerbates the emotional toll. these elements collectively point to a significant level of stress experienced by the individual."
"And here I am, several years later. But I hadn't expected to still be alive by now. So planning anything for more than a few hours in the future feels stupid and pointless. Self-harm and suicide seem like pretty decent options most days. As a compromise, I sleep, because being unconscious gives me a chance to not be in this world for a little while.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of hopelessness and emotional turmoil, which are classic indicators of stress. the individual's admission of not expecting to be alive suggests a prolonged struggle with suicidal ideation. planning for the future feeling ""stupid and pointless"" highlights a lack of motivation and an overwhelming sense of futility, both of which are common in individuals experiencing severe stress or depression. the mention of self-harm and suicide as ""decent options"" further underscores the severity of their mental state, indicating a high level of distress. finally, using sleep as an escape mechanism from reality suggests a coping strategy to temporarily alleviate their psychological pain. these elements collectively point to significant emotional distress and a strained mental health condition."
My abuse ended years ago. My life is good now. I'm about to get married to someone really wonderful. Everything is great. But it still feels wrong that I'm still alive.,0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on past abuse and acknowledging that their life has significantly improved, with positive developments such as an upcoming marriage to a wonderful partner. however, despite these positive changes, the individual expresses a lingering sense of wrongness about being alive. this paradoxical feeling, despite the positive context, suggests underlying unresolved emotions. while the individual recognizes their current life's goodness, the dissonance between their external circumstances and internal feelings could be indicative of residual effects from past trauma. the key indicators here are the acknowledgment of a good present life juxtaposed with the lingering sense of something being wrong, which might reflect deeper, unprocessed emotional layers rather than current stress."
"I recovered somewhat after a few hours but somethings changed now; I cant be alone without constantly feeling like Im on the verge of another attack. When my fiance is home Im perfectly fine, but as soon as she leaves for work (I work from home) I start to feel terrified, my feet and hands start sweating, I feel like Im about to be sick, I get lightheaded and I feel like I become wayyyy too conscious of my breathing to the point where I focus on it and it feels like no matter how much I exhale and inhale Im not actually breathing. I dont understand why this is happening....Ive never had issues being alone; now I cant even be alone in my own home. This feels like my life is ruined if I dont get it under control because I cant work like this. What the hell is happening?",1,"the narrative describes a significant change in the individual's ability to function independently, marked by intense physical and emotional reactions when alone. specific examples include sweating hands and feet, lightheadedness, a heightened focus on breathing, and feelings of terror. these symptoms are indicative of anxiety and panic attacks, common stress responses. the individual's distress about the inability to be alone and the impact on their work further underscores the presence of stress. the use of phrases like ""constantly feeling like im on the verge of another attack"" and ""this feels like my life is ruined"" highlights the severity of their experience. such expressions of helplessness and urgency are typical indicators of significant stress."
"It's hard for me to even type this, but today I dropped my classes after only a week of school. I've been in school for a while, just got my associate's degree in liberal arts at a community college and was planning on going to university for an English degree. I will note that the majority of my classes were online as I can't focus in an in-person class due to my social anxiety. However, I panicked about my future and how English isn't a ""lucrative"" field and changed gears. I enrolled in a program that was for Physical Therapy Assisting.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the writer's expression of difficulty in even typing their message, suggesting a high level of emotional distress. the abrupt decision to drop classes after only a week indicates an impulsive reaction often associated with stress and anxiety. the writer's background of social anxiety, which affects their ability to focus in an in-person class, adds another layer of psychological strain. the panic about their future and the perceived lack of financial stability in their chosen field further amplifies their stress, leading to a drastic change in their academic direction. this combination of emotional turmoil, anxiety about future prospects, and sudden decision-making are clear markers of an individual experiencing stress."
SIL and BIL are seeing s couples therapist as well as individual therapists. SIL is adamant that she wants my wife and I to participate in group therapy with both of them and that my BIL wants to set the record straight and feels awkward around our family. He hasn't personally apologized for his actions and states that my SIL fell and hit her head on dumbbells in their apt. I do not believe him. He has only apologized that we had to deal with the entire mess.,0,"the narrative describes a complex family situation involving multiple individuals in therapy, which might initially suggest a high-stress environment. however, the writer maintains a relatively detached and observational tone, indicating a level of emotional distance from the turmoil. the focus is on reporting events and actions rather than expressing intense emotions or personal distress. the writer does not describe feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, or other emotional responses typically associated with stress. instead, they present a clear account of what has happened and the actions taken by others, suggesting that they are managing the situation without significant personal stress. the lack of emotional language and the structured, matter-of-fact description of events are key indicators that the writer is not experiencing high levels of stress themselves."
"I constantly cancel plans on friends because sometimes going out is just too much. I recently heard about a friend of a friend who passed away at 25 from breast cancer and instead of empathy or sympathy, all I could feel was terrified fear that I would get diagnosed with the same cancer that she had. That was all I could think about - and that always happens when I hear about someone else dying. Ugh. I don't even know.",1,"the narrative displays several indicators of stress, beginning with the avoidance behavior described, such as constantly canceling plans with friends because going out feels overwhelming. this avoidance is a common symptom of stress and anxiety, as social interactions can become too demanding for someone experiencing high levels of stress. the narrative also reveals a preoccupation with mortality, specifically a pronounced fear of being diagnosed with breast cancer after hearing about a young person’s death. this intense fear and fixation on personal health risks, especially when it dominates thoughts and emotions, is another hallmark of stress. the individual's response to hearing about death, focusing on their own potential for illness rather than feeling empathy, suggests a heightened state of anxiety and stress. this pervasive worry and the feeling of being overwhelmed by such thoughts are consistent with stress responses, making these elements significant indicators in the narrative."
"I was raised by a narcissistic grandmother and emotionally unavailable mother. In fact, when I was born, she tried to take it upon herself to take full custody away from my mother because apparently my mom was 'unfit' to be a mother. She never did because she found out that my biological father might have had to be involved. My grandma kept me away from my father my entire life, he barely knows I exist, I've never spoken directly with him, in fact, his identity was hidden from me for 22 years, up until last May. My grandmother was very emotionally abusive towards me as a child.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging and emotionally taxing upbringing involving a narcissistic grandmother and an emotionally unavailable mother. specific examples, such as the grandmother's attempt to take full custody and the concealment of the biological father's identity, highlight significant familial conflict and secrecy. despite these difficult circumstances, the narrative lacks explicit indicators of current stress. there is no mention of ongoing emotional distress, anxiety, or overwhelming feelings that typically signify stress. the recounting of past events is factual and detached, suggesting a level of processing and acceptance rather than active emotional turmoil. this perspective indicates that the individual may have come to terms with their past experiences and is not presently overwhelmed by them."
"I told her about the darkest parts of my soul, and she never flinched. Well, a few days ago, she says that I am too old for her, and she just wants to be friends. I have never been friends with an ex before. But I cared about her enough to try. New Years Day - she calls to tell me about how drunk she got at a party, and how they all played a kissing game (she was the judge, and kissed at least half a dozen people, men and women), and how she was so drunk that some of her friends had to babysit her and even help her pee.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual shares deeply personal and vulnerable aspects of themselves with someone they care about. despite the emotional weight of these disclosures, the person they confide in responds without judgment. however, a shift occurs when the confidant expresses a desire to transition the relationship to friendship due to an age difference. the individual is willing to adapt to this new dynamic, indicating flexibility and a lack of overwhelming distress. the narrative continues with an account of the confidant's behavior at a party, including heavy drinking and participating in a kissing game. while these events might be unsettling or disappointing, the individual recounts them in a straightforward manner without signs of significant emotional turmoil or distress. this suggests a level of emotional resilience and an ability to manage and process complex interpersonal dynamics without succumbing to stress."
Exercise has helped in the past with my anxiety but since I have been having my recent dealings of anxiety I have been finding it harder to get active. A triggering factor of my anxiety over the last few weeks has been an increased heart rate. Sometimes if I stand up too fast/run up the stairs my heart starts pounding and then my mind spirals into the fear of a heart attack and my heart beat just keeps increasing till the point of anxiety. I have been taking walks and my heart rate would increase (naturally) and I would get the fear and my fears would multiple till the point when I would be close to a panic attack. I would like to start riding my bike again or working out in general but I am afraid of:,1,"the narrative clearly demonstrates several indicators of stress. the author mentions experiencing anxiety and specifically points out that their usual coping mechanism, exercise, has become difficult due to recent exacerbations of anxiety symptoms. the fear of a heart attack triggered by an increased heart rate is a common stress-related concern, particularly for those with anxiety disorders. the description of the heart rate increasing upon standing up quickly or running up the stairs, followed by a mental spiral into fear, is a classic example of anxiety-induced stress. the mention of walking and the subsequent escalation of fear leading to near panic attacks further emphasizes the presence of significant stress. the author’s desire to resume activities like biking or working out but feeling afraid to do so indicates a pervasive sense of apprehension and stress about physical activity, which they previously found helpful. this narrative reflects the cyclical nature of anxiety and stress, where fear of symptoms perpetuates the stress itself."
"and money will be tight. I sometimes augment my income with Mturk, but additional advice on how to make a little extra cash would be appreciated (would have to be one time gigs though due to the nature of my disability, I can't hold down a long term job. Stuff like plasma donation, opinion surveys, medical studies, etc.) Any kind of life hacks, government assistance, etc. that I do not know about would be appreciated.",0,"the narrative reflects a pragmatic and solution-focused mindset, indicative of someone managing their situation rather than being overwhelmed by it. the individual acknowledges financial constraints and proactively seeks advice on augmenting their income through various means, demonstrating resourcefulness and adaptability. they mention their disability but do so in a matter-of-fact manner, without expressing significant emotional distress or hopelessness. instead, they are focused on finding practical solutions such as plasma donation, opinion surveys, and medical studies. their request for life hacks and government assistance also indicates a proactive approach to problem-solving rather than a passive or defeated attitude. these aspects suggest a level of control and composure, typical of someone who is managing their stress effectively rather than being consumed by it."
"I've read that quality sleep, regular exercise, and fish oil all can help. Does that sound right? What are the best, non-pharma methods to help resolve anxiety? What about mediation (and is there a suggested starting point)? While I'm probably genetically more prone to anxiety, is it that I've let my body down somehow?",1,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking solutions for anxiety, which is a common symptom of stress. the person mentions genetic predisposition to anxiety, suggesting a heightened awareness of their mental health. the questions about non-pharmaceutical methods and lifestyle changes like sleep, exercise, and fish oil indicate a desire for control and management of their condition, often seen in those experiencing stress. the mention of mediation and seeking a starting point implies a proactive approach to coping mechanisms, which is a typical response when someone feels overwhelmed. overall, the narrative showcases concern about personal well-being and a search for effective strategies to alleviate stress-related symptoms."
"And it only took me three doctors telling me this over the span of 10+ years for me to believe it. Given all the crazy symptoms I've had, and that I really trust and like my current doc, I'm willing to believe it. So here I am looking at a bottle of Escitalopram (5mg, Lexapro generic) thinking ""so... it's come to this"". I've always been a shy one, but I thought I could handle anxiety on my own. However, 3 years ago I hit a giant anxiety wall (not knowing that's what it was).",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who has experienced significant anxiety and symptoms over a long period, but the tone suggests a sense of acceptance and readiness to address the issue with professional help. the mention of trusting their current doctor and being willing to try medication indicates a proactive and hopeful approach. the use of phrases like ""i am willing to believe it"" and ""so here i am"" implies a shift towards positive action rather than being overwhelmed by stress. the narrative also highlights self-awareness and a rational perspective on their mental health journey, which are not typical indicators of acute stress. instead, these aspects suggest a person who is managing their situation with a sense of control and optimism."
"It was hard to function I didn't used to be like this though. **Is there a road back to normalcy? ** I want my life back. I guess I'll start doping myself up with Escitalopram for now, but I'd rather it not become a crutch.",1,"the narrative reflects a struggle with functioning and a longing for a return to a previous state of normalcy, which are common indicators of stress. the expression of difficulty in functioning suggests significant distress and impairment in daily activities. the rhetorical question about finding a road back to normalcy indicates a sense of uncertainty and desperation. the desire to reclaim one's life points to a loss of control and dissatisfaction with the current state. the mention of using escitalopram, an antidepressant, implies the presence of symptoms that require medical intervention, and the concern about it becoming a crutch highlights a fear of dependency and further indicates ongoing stress. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing significant stress and is seeking ways to manage and overcome it."
I’m leaving for the airport right now and i’m so fucking scared. I’ve been nauseous all day and already puked like 4 times even though i haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday. I will have to check my bags in and talk to the attendant and then go through security without holding up the queue. And then sit inches away from a stranger on the plane. At least I have a window seat.,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the writer expresses intense fear and anxiety about traveling, evidenced by the use of strong language such as ""so fucking scared."" physical symptoms like nausea and vomiting multiple times despite not eating are classic signs of acute stress and anxiety. the detailed anticipation of the steps involved in the airport process, such as checking bags, talking to the attendant, and going through security, suggests a heightened level of worry and preoccupation with potential problems. the concern about not holding up the queue indicates a fear of social judgment or causing inconvenience to others, which can be a stress trigger. the mention of sitting close to a stranger on the plane further highlights discomfort with personal space and potential social anxiety. the slight relief expressed about having a window seat suggests a search for some control or comfort in an otherwise stressful situation. overall, the narrative reflects a state of heightened emotional and physical stress, with clear examples of both psychological and physiological symptoms."
"Tomorrow I bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. I'm heartbroken and I will be speaking at his funeral. I am happy with the speech but I am nervous, petrified to mess up.

"Hi, everyone! Just a warning, kind of a long story, as you can probably tell from the paragraph. So my relationship with anxiety has always been a thing, at least from what I remember from childhood (undiagnosed OCD). But recently my anxiety has gotten worse, no thanks to unfortunate events over the past few years involving 3 family deaths and the loss of a childhood home and pets. While I have always been kind of an anxious person, I have upgraded (downgraded?)",1,"the narrative reflects several clear indicators of stress. the author mentions a long-standing relationship with anxiety, suggesting a persistent underlying issue. the recent exacerbation of anxiety due to significant life events such as family deaths and the loss of a childhood home and pets are classic stressors. these events are known to cause considerable emotional turmoil and can worsen pre-existing mental health conditions. the use of the phrase ""upgraded (downgraded?)"" indicates a self-awareness of the worsening condition, adding to the narrative's weight. these elements collectively point to a heightened state of stress, with both historical and situational factors contributing to the individual's current mental health status."
"I worry that if I sit around too often, I will develop blood clots and die. Anything to do with death really. On top of that, I have been developing intrusive thoughts. But the worst part is that last week I was laying in bed and randomly became afraid that I was going to lose my sense of reality and start hallucinating. I have never hallucinated in my life (unless you count the 2 times that I tried psychedelics) and have never had this fear before but it scared the shit out of me.",1,"the narrative exhibits clear signs of stress through the expression of persistent worry and fear. the individual describes a preoccupation with the possibility of developing blood clots and dying, which indicates a heightened level of anxiety about health and mortality. this kind of catastrophic thinking is often associated with stress and anxiety disorders. additionally, the mention of developing intrusive thoughts further supports the presence of stress, as these unwanted and distressing thoughts are a common symptom of anxiety. the account of suddenly fearing a loss of reality and potential hallucinations, despite no prior history of such experiences, underscores the intensity of the individual's anxiety. this irrational fear and the emotional response it elicited are indicative of a heightened stress response. the narrative's focus on these fears and the emotional impact they have on the individual highlights the significant psychological distress they are experiencing."
"Other things that are good about me... well, I can cook really well! I can make anything as long as I have a recipe. I can also draw anime art, too, though I'm still an amateur (I can show it privately!).

"And I think it's important to get to know someone for a bit before making a decision to live together. I'm happy to send pictures of me, talk via voice, webcam, or whatever. The major restriction I have is that it will have to be at specific times because my abusive partner is home most days. I also will have to speak with anyone on secret messaging accounts when the abusive partner is not home, so I am not always available to talk about this but I check those accounts as much as possible. Due to anticipated trolling and people just asking questions that I've already answered (like telling me to go to a shelter instead), rather than coming back to all these posts (I'm posting this on a ton of websites) to see the replies, I'm just going to let anyone who is serious about speaking to me message me privately through the following places.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is cautious about forming a relationship and moving in with someone, emphasizing the importance of getting to know the other person first. they mention logistical constraints due to the presence of an abusive partner, which necessitates specific times for communication and the use of secret messaging accounts. the individual also anticipates unhelpful responses and prefers private messages from serious individuals. despite the challenging situation, the tone remains practical and focused on finding a solution, indicating a level of resilience and strategic thinking. these aspects suggest that the person is managing their circumstances with a clear plan and not exhibiting signs of overwhelming stress or distress."
"Last time we talked she promised that it wouldn’t be the last time we saw each other, and she said she couldn’t imagine there ever being a last time we saw each other. I don’t know what my exact question is on all of this but if anyone has any advice, criticism or has gone though a similar experience I’d appreciate input. Thanks for reading Tl;dr: Girlfriend and I are taking an indefinite break, but we still see us in the future. Should I maintain this hope for us despite some complications during the break up?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of uncertainty and seeking advice rather than clear indicators of stress. the individual recounts a conversation with their girlfriend, mentioning promises and future hopes. while there is a break in the relationship, the tone is more inquisitive and open to external input rather than expressing overwhelming stress or anxiety. the writer is actively looking for advice and criticism, indicating a proactive approach to understanding the situation. the mention of ""thanks for reading"" and ""tl;dr"" suggests a structured and composed mindset, which is not typical of someone under significant stress. overall, the narrative lacks the intensity and urgency that would typically characterize a stressed individual."
"I have extremely depressed and yes I've thought about suicide, but my family needs me alive, they need me or they may die, it's very dire where they live. I need pointers on how to find a good city to be homeless in, how to obtain a mailing address so I don't lose my SSDI (they've already pulled the stunt of ""you have 10 days from this mailing to respond or you are kicked off of SSDI, give us your last 5 years records) they've done this 4 times already in the past 10 years. I've been rejected for DSS services, no food stamps, I'm losing medicaid (but still have medicare, for now), no housing help (waiting list here is years), and only one agency is still willing to help me, a job agency, and the workers there are very distraught over my situation as they've tried very hard with me to help me get a good job. I have about 10 solid skills but I keep getting turned away and we cannot figure out why? I don't use drugs or alcohol, haven't even smoked weed since a teen and I'm about 61 years old.",1,"the narrative presents several indicators of significant stress. the author describes feelings of extreme depression and mentions suicidal thoughts, which are strong signals of psychological distress. the concern for their family's well-being adds to their burden, suggesting a sense of overwhelming responsibility and urgency. the struggle to maintain basic needs, such as housing, food, and medical services, highlights a precarious living situation that contributes to chronic stress. the repeated bureaucratic challenges with social security disability insurance (ssdi) and the lack of support from social services further exacerbate their anxiety. despite having valuable skills, the inability to secure employment and the emotional toll it takes on both the author and the job agency workers underscore a persistent and unresolved state of stress. the narrative is marked by a sense of hopelessness and frustration, which are common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress."
"He had the sweetest voice and only the kindest heart. I had started talking to him for a month or so, by then we had gotten to know one another well. He had told me a little about his past as I slowly opened up about mine, sometimes I wouldn't even talk but I'd still sit in his office and he'd make every gesture. Sometimes we wouldn't even talk about my problems but other things in life and what we were into. It was hardly ever about school, it was like I had a friend that developed into a crush real quick.",0,"the narrative describes a positive and supportive relationship between the author and another individual. the tone is warm and affectionate, highlighting the individual's kind heart and sweet voice. the author feels comfortable enough to open up about their past, indicating a sense of trust and safety. the interactions are described as enjoyable and comforting, with conversations often drifting away from problems to more pleasant topics. the development of a crush suggests feelings of excitement and happiness rather than distress. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of stress such as anxiety, overwhelming emotions, or negative thoughts, and instead reflects a sense of well-being and emotional support."
"I noticed that towards the end of my stay at the school he had grown protective, maybe flirty. We were constantly talking, he would pull me out of classes ,I hardly attended, to talk. He would cut someone's counseling session short to see me sooner. If any other authority figure tried to talk to me he was quickly my shadow. He had set me up with several services to do with therapy (I had already seen a lot but he made room for more.)",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is reflecting on interactions with an individual who was attentive and perhaps overly involved in their life. the tone of the narrative is observational rather than emotional, focusing on the actions of the other person rather than the author's internal state. there is no mention of anxiety, worry, or any other emotional distress that would typically indicate stress. instead, the narrative details specific behaviors of the other person, such as pulling the author out of classes and prioritizing their sessions, without expressing any negative feelings about these actions. the lack of emotional language and the focus on external events rather than internal experiences suggest that the author is not currently experiencing stress."
"That's the thing that really bothers me, not so much the act of sending one text, but sending one text doesn't make me feel done, it carries the weight of every other text I'll have to send. When I see someone's name come up on my caller ID I almost always get this flare of panic, and then just ignore it, even though I actually like chatting with my friends on the phone. It hardly ever even occurs to me to actually answer it (except family because they're equally uncommunicative so it's probably really important). Not an excuse, but I think I learned all of this -- especially my refusal to answer the phone -- from my parents, my mom more than my dad. They've don't stay in touch with people they aren't living in close proximity to, and they're pretty terrible at communicating consistently with us as well.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly through the description of emotional responses to communication tasks. the mention of a ""flare of panic"" when receiving calls and the tendency to ignore them suggests a heightened anxiety response. this avoidance behavior, despite an expressed enjoyment of chatting with friends, highlights a conflict between desire and stress-induced actions. the weight attributed to sending a single text, as it symbolizes the burden of future communications, further illustrates the overwhelming nature of these seemingly simple tasks. additionally, the individual identifies a learned pattern of poor communication from their parents, suggesting a deep-rooted source of stress related to social interactions. these elements combined portray a person experiencing considerable stress in their daily interactions and communication habits."

"*Begins quoting a rap and making hand gestures* ""Go out and make a name or do something!"" Everyone ignores him. He came back to his bunk and starts mumbling, ""I hear you talking under your breathe man don't think I don't cause I do don't start with me today."" Not sure if that was directed towards me or not because I never did that, but whatever. He starts to leave and I start going,",0,"the narrative describes an individual engaging in behavior that seems unusual, such as quoting a rap and making hand gestures, and then mumbling to themselves. however, the context provided suggests that this behavior does not elicit concern from the narrator, as they note that everyone ignores the individual and they themselves are uncertain if the mumbling is directed towards them. the narrator's reaction of indifference or dismissal (""but whatever"") indicates that the situation does not provoke anxiety or stress. these reactions imply that the environment or the individual’s behavior is perceived as benign or unthreatening, aligning with a state of non-stress. the absence of heightened emotional responses, like fear or worry, supports this interpretation."

"I have been seeing mia for about 3-4 months Last night we were together drinking at a little get together before going to the club about 7-8 people in a small group, everyone knows each other pretty well. Mia was drunk and being quite obnoxious which can be fun just as much as it can be bad? She started talking about how her girl friends all get nice things from their boyfriends, a $500 hair job, presents/gifts whatever Made me feel a bit uncomfortable because it was clearly something targeted at me and she was saying this in front of everyone",0,"the narrative describes a social situation involving mia and the author, where mia's behavior becomes a focal point. while mia's comments made the author feel uncomfortable, the overall tone of the narrative does not suggest significant distress or anxiety. the author mentions the context of a social gathering, which typically involves a degree of relaxation and enjoyment. the discomfort described appears situational and specific to mia's behavior rather than indicative of a pervasive stress response. there are no signs of overwhelming worry, preoccupation, or physical symptoms commonly associated with stress. the author's reaction seems more related to a momentary awkwardness rather than an ongoing emotional strain."
"and I giggled. He stomped towards me, mocked my laugh with an angry face and ripped the keys from my hands. He grabbed me by the top of my shirt and looked me in my eyes and said ""Stop playing these stupid F*CKING games"". That was my childhood. He'd abuse me and my brother.",0,"the narrative describes a troubling and abusive childhood experience. however, the description is presented in a past tense and seems to recount an event rather than express ongoing stress. the tone is somewhat detached, focusing on the factual recounting of the event rather than the emotional impact it has on the narrator in the present. the use of specific, vivid details about the abusive behavior might suggest trauma, but the lack of immediate emotional language or expressions of current distress could indicate that the author is not experiencing active stress at the moment of writing. the narrative reads more like a historical account rather than an expression of ongoing psychological strain."
"Just a simple ""seen"" status can get me into a deep downward spiral of anxiety that suppresses my hunger, takes away my will to do anything, makes me nauseous, takes away my sleep. As soon as the person texts back, I immediately feel okay. I've had relationships with girls that I've felt this way. Both times it was long term and both times I ended it. I somehow find a way to ignore every good thing I had thought before and find all that I feel she misses on other girls.",1,"the narrative describes a significant emotional response to a ""seen"" status, which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety. this anxiety manifests in physical symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, and insomnia. the immediate relief felt upon receiving a text back indicates a dependency on external validation for emotional stability. the individual also mentions a pattern in relationships where initial positive feelings are overshadowed by a focus on perceived deficiencies, leading to the end of long-term relationships. these patterns of intense emotional reactions, physical symptoms, and relational instability are indicative of high stress levels and anxiety."
"**TL;DR's** 1st: Why would parents be like this to their kids? Thinking they need to be treated like a king, or willing to say they wish their kids would just vanish isn't normal parenting, right? Or am I just insane? I know I'd never do that.",0,"the narrative reflects a questioning and somewhat perplexed tone rather than one that is overtly stressed. the author is expressing confusion and concern about certain parental behaviors they deem abnormal, such as treating children like royalty or wishing them to disappear. while these topics could be distressing, the narrative lacks indicators of personal stress, such as emotional language, descriptions of physical symptoms, or signs of overwhelming anxiety. instead, the author is more focused on seeking validation and understanding about parenting norms, which suggests a more analytical and curious mindset rather than one burdened by stress."
"I'm too insecure not to make it into some sarcastic joke like, ""bet you actually can't wait to get rid of me,"" blah blah. Late August, I'm days from leaving and he's desperate for my time, looking to meet me after work everyday and have me stay over. I'm unsure of what to make of all it which in retrospect is so stupid on my part. I just can't stop denying things to myself. Anyway, two nights before I'm leaving, he mentions how we've never defined what our relationship is.",1,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing significant stress, as evidenced by the insecurity and self-doubt expressed in their thoughts and actions. the person mentions making sarcastic jokes to mask their insecurities, which is a common coping mechanism for those under stress. the urgency and desperation for time from the other person, coupled with the uncertainty about the relationship's status, contribute to the individual's emotional turmoil. the retrospective self-criticism and inability to accept reality further indicate an internal struggle. these elements, such as the need for reassurance, self-denial, and relationship ambiguity, are typical indicators of stress and emotional distress."
"So I'm a student living off loans and part time work, he's a bank executive. We couldn't be at more different places in our lives, including when we met (again) back in Feb 2017. But we actually had a lot in common, including our sexuality -- both bi and both never formally dated a guy. We first met four years earlier when I was a security guard at the building he worked at. I noticed him right off the bat but was closeted at the time and never put much thought into him other than attraction, even when he became super friendly toward me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of calm and acceptance rather than stress. the author describes their financial situation and relationship history in a matter-of-fact tone, without expressing anxiety or distress. the mention of living off loans and part-time work, while indicative of a challenging situation, is presented without emotional turmoil. the relationship dynamics are recounted with a focus on shared experiences and commonalities, rather than conflicts or pressures. the narrative also highlights a past connection that was positive and friendly, suggesting a level of comfort and ease in recalling these events. overall, the absence of negative emotions or stress-related symptoms such as worry, tension, or urgency in the narrative supports the classification."
"I also added up the value of everything I can possibly remember that's either missing or destroyed, and it reaches over 2,100 dollars...and that's a lenient estimate, I definitely rounded down. But I'd love to charge another grand for mental anguish or whatever. The whole ordeal has been like Trigger-City for someone like me who is struggling to recover from mental illnesses and over a year and 9 months clean after 10-12 years of substance abuse. I'm also receiving supportive services from a county program aimed at helping mentally ""screwed up"" people become independent, for lack of a better term. What's cool about the service is that I get a case manager who I can call for advice and in turn checks on me and referred me to a halfway house which only lasts 30 days but it's much better than having to stay at the local shelter, which might be my only option come June...",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress through several key indicators. the author discusses a significant financial loss, which is inherently stressful, and mentions this loss in a detailed and specific manner, indicating preoccupation with the issue. the phrase ""trigger-city"" suggests that the situation is exacerbating their existing mental health challenges, highlighting their vulnerability and heightened emotional state. the reference to recovering from long-term substance abuse and the precise duration of their sobriety underscores their ongoing struggle and the fragility of their recovery. the reliance on supportive services and the mention of potentially having to stay at a local shelter further illustrate the precariousness of their living situation, adding to their stress. the tone conveys a sense of being overwhelmed and the use of terms like ""mental anguish"" and ""mentally 'screwed up'"" points to a deep-seated distress. all these elements combined paint a clear picture of someone experiencing significant stress."
"But what should I say? Part of me wants to tell her I'm sorry for being a shit boyfriend at the start and that as I've gotten older I've gotten wiser and more experience. But would she even care about that shit? Or should I just start off with ""Hey, haven't seen you in awhile, hows everything"" and start from there? Ugh, maybe I'm overthinking this... Anyways would really appreciate you guys or gals out there with more experience than me guiding me through this minor plight I put myself in.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author is experiencing significant indecision and self-doubt, evident in their questioning of what to say and how to approach the situation. the internal conflict about whether to apologize or to start with casual conversation shows an underlying anxiety about the potential reaction and outcome. phrases like ""maybe i am overthinking this"" and ""minor plight i put myself in"" indicate that the author is aware of their own over-analysis and the self-imposed nature of their stress. seeking advice from others also suggests a lack of confidence and a need for external validation, which are common in individuals experiencing stress. overall, the narrative's tone and content reflect a preoccupation with making the right decision and concern over past actions, both of which are indicative of stress."
"After that I ran to Mexico, just across the border to heal. I needed my daughter to get better to press charges. I didn’t want to risk him walking away free because my daughter wouldn’t talk. She was physically and emotionally hurt. For years without sleep, several visits to the ER because of panick attacks, plus terrible head aches caused by a cyst in the back left side of her brain.",1,"the narrative describes a situation filled with significant emotional turmoil and distress. the author mentions fleeing to mexico for healing, which suggests a desperate need for escape and recovery. the concern for the daughter's well-being and the need for her to be in a condition to press charges highlight a high-stress environment. the mention of physical and emotional harm to the daughter, along with the author's sleeplessness and frequent emergency room visits due to panic attacks, are strong indicators of chronic stress. additionally, the mention of headaches caused by a cyst in the daughter's brain adds a layer of medical stress to the already overwhelming emotional burden. these elements collectively point to a narrative marked by high levels of stress, as the author grapples with the immediate and long-term impacts of trauma and seeks justice and healing for their daughter."
I had a pretty creepy experience almost a week ago. I've never had a hallucination like that. So disconnected and vivid and super weird. I was anxious because I was in a building filled with people. Then all of a sudden I hallucinated where I was in a dark room all by myself.,1,"the narrative describes a vivid and unsettling hallucination, which is a strong indicator of stress. the individual's experience of feeling disconnected and anxious in a crowded building suggests heightened levels of stress and anxiety. the sudden shift to a hallucination of being in a dark room alone highlights a significant mental and emotional response, which is often associated with stress. the description of the hallucination as ""super weird"" and ""vivid"" further emphasizes the intensity of the experience. such intense and abnormal sensory experiences are typical indicators of a stressed state, as they reflect the mind's response to overwhelming anxiety and pressure."
"I didn’t tell her my feelings, because I value her too much, but do not want to hurt her. I just want to let go of all my feelings, but I can’t. There’s only a few days left at school, after which we might go our different ways. But I have this strange feeling inside, that I do not want to live in any sort of regret, about not telling her how I felt. It’s just really weird.",0,"the narrative reflects a scenario where the individual is grappling with unexpressed feelings and the anticipation of potential regret. while there is an emotional struggle, the overall tone does not suggest overwhelming stress. the individual is thoughtful and considerate about the consequences of their actions, showing a level of emotional regulation and introspection. the mention of valuing the other person and not wanting to hurt them indicates a balanced perspective. the uncertainty about the future and the ""strange feeling inside"" are typical of normal emotional experiences rather than indicative of heightened stress. the language used is reflective and contemplative, without signs of distress or anxiety that would suggest a stressed state."
"They've since tried to apologise for their behaviour, and other friends have tried to encourage me to forgive them and reconnect with them. But I refuse to. I have some amazing people in my life who far more deserve my attention. I now realise these people were a huge source of some of my anxiety and cutting them off has gone a long way towards finding some stability. Don't be afraid to shut the door on those who don't deserve you!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of empowerment and clarity, indicating that the individual has taken proactive steps to improve their mental well-being. they mention having amazing people in their life who deserve their attention, suggesting a supportive social network. the decision to cut off those who were a source of anxiety highlights a healthy boundary-setting behavior, which is a positive coping mechanism. the tone of the narrative is resolute and confident, rather than anxious or distressed. the advice to not be afraid to shut the door on undeserving people further underscores a sense of control and self-worth. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress, but rather has moved towards a more stable and positive mental state."
"I get it, people collect guns as a hobby, this is america. When I saw it I immediately panicked because when I was with one of my abusive exes he bought an AR-15 really close to the end of our relationship and would do things like take it apart and put it back together over and over again in front of me and keep it loaded in our bed and I’ve been terrified of guns of all kinds ever since. I can’t even use a staple gun. This new guy and I just talking and haven’t decided to go on a date yet but it might go that way. Is this something that I’m panicking about because of my past or should I really be concerned?",1,"the narrative describes a person's intense reaction to seeing a gun, which is directly tied to a traumatic experience with an abusive ex-partner who owned and manipulated an ar-15. the mention of immediate panic upon seeing the gun indicates a strong emotional response linked to past trauma. the individual also expresses a pervasive fear of guns, extending even to staple guns, highlighting the depth of their anxiety. the narrative further explores uncertainty about whether their reaction is a justified concern or a result of their past experiences, suggesting ongoing internal conflict and heightened stress levels. these elements are indicative of significant stress and anxiety, likely stemming from unresolved trauma and fear."
"I went to the ER recently because it reached 100 bpm and wouldn’t go down but in retrospect it’s because I was reinforcing my anxiety by numbers high, it won’t go down, oh shit number’s higher and it won’t go down. Repeat. I turned off heart rate tracking and fitness tracking. It’s a shame because I feel it’s turning off a valuable part of the device but quantifiable health data has become one of my triggers. If x to x+5 is a healthy range I freak at x+6 etc.",1,"the narrative reflects a clear struggle with anxiety and stress, as evidenced by the repeated cycles of worry about heart rate numbers. the individual describes a situation where their heart rate reached 100 bpm, leading them to visit the er, indicating a significant level of concern and fear. the phrase ""reinforcing my anxiety by numbers"" highlights a cognitive pattern often associated with stress, where the person fixates on specific data points, causing their anxiety to escalate. the decision to turn off heart rate and fitness tracking, despite recognizing its potential benefits, underscores the extent to which these metrics have become stress triggers. the mention of ""quantifiable health data"" and the reaction to slight deviations from the ""healthy range"" further illustrates a heightened state of vigilance and anxiety, common in individuals experiencing stress. overall, the narrative is marked by a preoccupation with health metrics and a pattern of catastrophic thinking, both indicative of stress."
"Like she knew she had gotten herself into a bad situation but now I'm just ""trying to put doubts in her head about her girlfriend"". And how it's okay because her girlfriend has depression.

I need answers.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the writer describes a situation involving significant emotional turmoil and conflict, particularly with references to manipulation and severe depression. the mention of ""trying to put doubts in her head"" suggests a struggle with trust and communication. the writer's comparison of their own behavior to that of the girlfriend's highlights feelings of injustice and frustration. phrases like ""i need answers"" reflect a sense of desperation and a search for clarity amidst confusion. overall, the emotional intensity and the focus on negative experiences are typical signs of stress."

We attend the same school and I feel like someone is crushing my heart whenever I see her or if I see that she's sent me a text.

I have to be in bed at 10pm.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of stability and positive change in the individual's life. the curfew and structured environment at the shelter provide a grounding influence, which is crucial for mental well-being. the individual acknowledges the benefits of the new routine, noting an improvement even after just one day. the shift from harmful behaviors like staying up late and spending money on binging and purging to having a set bedtime and managing emotions suggests a move towards healthier habits. this narrative showcases typical indicators of reduced stress, such as feeling safer, experiencing a boost from structure, and adopting more positive coping mechanisms. the overall tone is one of relief and progress, rather than distress."

I don't abuse alcohol or drugs, but I'm no different than someone who does...I have other mental health issues that I feel nobody really can understand. It has essentially rendered me a useless piece of shit.

How to cope? how to stop doubting that this is happening?",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through descriptions of avoidance behaviors and psychological distress. the individual mentions an inability to use public restrooms due to intense fear and dissociation, which are clear signs of anxiety and stress. the avoidance of certain shows linked to a traumatic hospital experience further highlights the impact of past events on their current mental state. the repeated self-doubt about the reality of their suffering suggests an ongoing internal struggle and possible symptoms of derealization or dissociation, common in stress-related disorders. the plea for coping mechanisms underscores a recognition of their distress and a desire for relief, reinforcing the presence of significant psychological stress."

I’ve got green beans to make green bean casserole, tea and coffee to keep me sane and comfortable while I’m in so much pain.

Being friends for years, the three of you are a narrow circle of good friends who are always together.

At the same time, I don't want to end things and then regret it and never get what we've had again.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is experiencing some relationship challenges but does not exhibit signs of significant stress. the person expresses a desire for personal space and time, which is a normal and healthy aspect of individual identity within a relationship. they acknowledge their partner's clinginess but do not describe feelings of overwhelming anxiety or distress about it. instead, they are contemplating their future and the compatibility with their partner, which is a common and rational thought process in relationships. the absence of language indicating intense emotional turmoil, such as feeling trapped, hopeless, or excessively anxious, suggests that the person is navigating these thoughts in a relatively calm and reflective manner. their concern about potentially regretting a decision to end the relationship also indicates a thoughtful and measured approach rather than a reaction driven by acute stress. overall, the narrative contains elements of normal relational introspection without clear markers of high stress."
Obviously this doesn’t help the mental health. I have a great relationship with a professor at my institution. Because I go to a SLAC close professor / student relationships are encouraged. My professor has been very helpful and making sure I get the mental health assistance needed while at school while also frequently checking in on me. This person has also offered to Skype me over break if I needed to chat or if being home became difficult.,0,"the narrative reflects a positive and supportive environment, which is beneficial for mental health. the individual mentions having a great relationship with a professor who is attentive and proactive in providing mental health support. the professor's willingness to offer assistance, even over breaks, indicates a strong support system. such relationships are crucial in mitigating stress, as they provide a sense of security and continuous support. the narrative does not exhibit signs of overwhelming stress or distress; instead, it highlights the presence of effective coping mechanisms and a supportive network, which are indicators of a stable mental state."

She isn't answering my phone calls, and will only give a vague text response with an I'll call you later while she is at work. Or HE will text me back and say she is fine and can't talk right now. I spoke to 2 of our mutual friends today and she isn't speaking to them as well. I can feel it in my soul that he is going to seriously hurt her or those babies.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of distress and anxiety. the author expresses fear and concern for someone they care about, indicating a strong emotional response to the situation. the repeated attempts to contact the person and the vague or dismissive responses they receive heighten their sense of worry. the involvement of mutual friends who are also unable to reach her adds to the author's sense of urgency and helplessness. the statement about feeling it in their soul that harm will come to her or the children is a powerful indicator of their heightened stress and anxiety. these elements collectively suggest a state of high emotional turmoil and stress."
"With the help of my therapist, I've come to somewhat of a revelation. I have a very hard time feeling a sense of accomplishment, especially for ""little"" things throughout the day. Obviously something like applying for a few jobs (I'm unemployed) isn't going to give anybody the same sense of accomplishment as something like earning a college degree. But I have a hard time not feeling like I should have applied for more, I'm still being lazy, a normal person would have done more, etc. Which in turn is making me feel like crap and leading me to apply for even less jobs and get less done.",1,"the narrative reflects a struggle with feelings of inadequacy and self-criticism, which are common indicators of stress. the individual expresses difficulty in recognizing and appreciating their daily achievements, feeling that their efforts are insufficient compared to what they perceive as normal standards. this self-imposed pressure and comparison to others can exacerbate feelings of worthlessness and frustration. the mention of being unemployed adds to the stress, as job searching can be a significant source of anxiety and self-doubt. the cycle of feeling unaccomplished and subsequently doing less, further perpetuates their negative self-perception. these patterns are typical of someone experiencing stress, as they highlight a persistent internal struggle and a critical self-view that hinders their ability to function optimally."
"He told me that we are at different places in life - he is looking to buy houses and I'm just starting grad school. I understand that I won't be financially stable for a few more years because I do have a student loan. But that being said I'm getting a master's in engineering so at worst I'm looking at a 5 year payback plan. He told me that he doesn't think we will work out long term because of being in different places. He thinks making adjustments to the differences between us will be ""forcing things to work out"".",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and rational approach to the situation. the individual acknowledges the differences in life stages between themselves and their partner, as well as the financial implications of their current educational pursuits. they display an understanding of their future financial stability despite the presence of student loans and have a clear plan for repayment. the mention of the partner's concerns about long-term compatibility is met with acceptance rather than emotional distress. the tone is calm and pragmatic, indicating a level of emotional resilience and a lack of overwhelming stress. the ability to articulate a logical plan for the future and the absence of catastrophic thinking are typical indicators of someone not experiencing significant stress."
"she then tells me i’m self centered and i’m a fuck up and i’m fucking my sister up. And once everything has been said 10 mins later she acts like she did none of it. she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the expression of emotional turmoil and interpersonal conflict. the individual's recounting of being verbally attacked and then experiencing a sudden shift in behavior from the aggressor highlights a chaotic and unpredictable environment. such inconsistency in interactions can lead to heightened anxiety and emotional distress. the use of strong language like ""self centered,"" ""fuck up,"" and ""fucking my sister up"" reflects internalized negative self-perception and feelings of worthlessness. additionally, the person's admission of confusion and mental exhaustion, illustrated by the phrases ""mentally making me lose it"" and ""i cant do this anymore,"" further underscores the overwhelming nature of their stress. the struggle to balance school, personal, and family issues amplifies the sense of being overwhelmed, a common experience for individuals under significant stress. these elements collectively point to a high level of psychological strain, indicative of a stressed state."
"i’m 15, i don’t want to be anywhere near my dad bc of the shit he’s done and this has been going on for 4 years now. she also claims i give her an attitude anytime i do something. today i took the pair of shorts to fold and she looked at me and said “ are you really gonna grab them like that? your a fucking asshole. your giving me an attitude after all this shit?",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly through the expression of ongoing familial conflict and emotional turmoil. the individual's avoidance of their father due to past negative experiences suggests a prolonged period of distress. the recounting of a specific incident with their mother, where harsh language and accusations of attitude are present, highlights a hostile and unsupportive environment. these interactions are likely contributing to the individual's heightened stress levels. the use of profanity and the detailed description of the negative encounter are strong markers of emotional strain. such environments can lead to chronic stress, especially in adolescents who are still developing coping mechanisms. overall, the narrative's content and tone are consistent with someone experiencing significant stress."

"Wrote this in about three minutes today. I need to work some things out but it is crazy how much writing has helped me in the past three and a half months. My therapist credits my journaling to the progress I am continuing to make. I want to send my thoughts to everyone posting on this sub, I am strong not only for myself but for you. Being in a toxic relationship is so isolating you don't even realize how many people feel hopeless and desperate for change.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of progress and empowerment, which are typical indicators of a non-stress state. the author mentions the therapeutic benefits of writing and acknowledges the positive impact journaling has had on their mental health. the reference to the therapist's approval of their journaling efforts further suggests that they are on a path to recovery and self-improvement. the author's intention to share their strength with others and their awareness of the broader community's struggles indicate a supportive and empathetic mindset. while they recognize the challenges of being in a toxic relationship, their tone is one of resilience and hope rather than distress. these elements collectively point to a state of mental well-being and active coping, rather than ongoing stress."
"Hey guys, circumstances in my life has brought me to being homeless starting tomorrow. I live in Central Florida and the reason why I come to this position is due to my car breaking down, not being able to make it to work since its a 35 mile commute, and now that I can't pay rent, I have to leave the room I'm renting. Lately though Ive been thinking a lot of leaving to New York. I'll be homeless there, yes, but at least I'll be able to get around with 24/7 transportation. My question is: Is this a good idea?",0,"the narrative describes a series of unfortunate events leading to homelessness, including a broken car and inability to pay rent. despite these challenges, the individual is considering a proactive solution by relocating to new york for better transportation options. this indicates problem-solving and forward-thinking, which are less typical of someone experiencing high stress. the question posed at the end shows openness to advice and planning, suggesting the person is managing their situation with a level of composure. the lack of overwhelming negative emotions or despair in the narrative further supports the notion that the individual is not under significant stress."
Lately I've just been having that terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach and also a feeling of nausea \- like I constantly need to throw up. I'm sleeping normal but still feeling so tired and drained and can't really focus at work \- and because of that I feel like my work performance is slipping up. I am constantly afraid that I'm going to lose my job and that my manager hates me. This has been happening so much more frequently. About a week ago my doc gave me prozac (once a day) and xanax (only as needed) prescriptions and I feel like it's helped with the bigger attacks and some dark thoughts but now its almost like just a little constant anxiety all the time and it sucks.,1,"the narrative describes a range of physical and emotional symptoms that are commonly associated with stress. the individual mentions a persistent feeling of nausea and a sensation in the pit of their stomach, which are physical manifestations often linked to anxiety and stress. despite sleeping normally, they report feeling tired and drained, indicating that their rest is not restorative, which is another sign of stress. difficulty focusing at work and concerns about job performance slipping are classic cognitive symptoms of stress, as is the fear of losing their job and the belief that their manager dislikes them. these thoughts suggest a heightened sense of anxiety and worry. the frequent occurrence of these feelings and the need for medication, such as prozac and xanax, further underscore the severity of the stress being experienced. the narrative conveys a sense of ongoing, pervasive anxiety that impacts daily functioning and overall well-being, which are key indicators of stress."
"For my two worst offenders, they will each get a postcard. Everyone at work will read that post card as it gets passed to the executive director of the rehab center. The old lady will get a warning that she's not smart enough to protect herself and she should be thankful she picked on another elderly widow woman instead of someone looking for revenge for fun. Over the years I've been to the mayor, I've attended a number of (laughable) ""homeless conferences"". It's all a joke so no approaching from that angle.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of cynicism and frustration rather than stress. the author describes their interactions and experiences with a certain level of detachment and sarcasm, suggesting a critical view of the situations mentioned. the reference to sending postcards to ""worst offenders"" and the dismissive attitude towards ""homeless conferences"" indicate a judgmental perspective rather than one rooted in personal stress. the tone is more indicative of someone who feels disillusioned with the systems and people around them, rather than someone who is overwhelmed or distressed. the language used, such as ""laughable"" and ""it is all a joke,"" further emphasizes a perspective of scorn rather than stress."
"The difference between nightmares and nigh terrors is diagnosed through sleep studies using tools that measure rapid eye movement. All of which tells me absolutely Sweet F*** All, let’s be honest. &nbsp; Sleep and our need for it is not entirely understood, many fantastic theories abound but what little we do states that it is a fundamental requirement for life. &nbsp;",0,"the narrative discusses the difference between nightmares and night terrors, focusing on the diagnostic process through sleep studies. it mentions the use of tools that measure rapid eye movement but dismisses their personal relevance with a colloquial and somewhat dismissive tone. the writer also touches on the enigmatic nature of sleep and its necessity for life, referencing the plethora of theories surrounding it. despite the somewhat cynical remark about the diagnostic tools, the overall tone remains analytical and detached rather than emotionally charged. there are no explicit signs of personal distress or anxiety; instead, the writer maintains a factual and inquisitive approach. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional language suggests a more objective stance, which is not typical of someone under significant stress."
"Brian has exactly the same responses. I know he is in a nightmare because I am fully aware of his breathing, his perspiration and his heart rate (a gift of growing up as a small child being hunted, there are some skills that are animalistic that I retain to this day). His service dog, Sasha, no longer wakes Brian up from his nightmares but stands up stretches, which is enough to wake me up and if I don’t fix the problem, she will wander over to my side of the bed lay her head on it and make that condescending “get a move on with it woman” growl she has developed. She loves me in that I exist and am occasionally useful. Smile.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving brian's nightmares and the service dog's behavior. while the details of brian's physical responses to nightmares and the dog's actions are noted, the tone of the narrative is relatively detached and observational. the writer mentions their awareness of brian's condition and the dog's signals in a matter-of-fact manner, without expressing personal distress or anxiety. the inclusion of humor, such as the dog's ""condescending growl"" and the affectionate yet lighthearted remark about the dog's attitude, suggests a coping mechanism that does not align with acute stress. the writer's ability to observe and describe the situation with a sense of humor and detachment indicates a level of emotional stability and resilience."
"My own sleep issues were that of a cat: I could sleep anywhere, anytime for brief at most 40 minute slots of time. I was known to lean against a wall and be fast asleep. On a 20 minute taxi ride. Boom. Out.",0,"the narrative describes a pattern of sleep that, while unusual, does not necessarily indicate stress. the individual mentions being able to sleep anywhere and anytime, suggesting a flexibility and adaptability in their sleep habits. there is no mention of difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feelings of fatigue and exhaustion which are common indicators of stress-related sleep disturbances. instead, the ability to fall asleep quickly in various environments could point to a non-stressed state where the person is able to relax and rest easily. the tone of the narrative is casual and almost humorous, lacking any expressions of frustration or concern that would typically accompany a stressed individual discussing their sleep issues."
"My flaws seemed huge to me, and I assumed everyone thought negatively of me all the time. My life was consumed by a spiral of negative thoughts and social anxiety. I went to my doc, admitted my social anxiety, and he prescribed me Lexapro 10mg/day. I took my first pill a few days ago, and not two hours later, I had nearly complete relief of my anxiety of all kinds. The bad thoughts completely stopped.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who initially experienced significant social anxiety and negative thoughts, which are common indicators of stress. however, the turning point in the narrative occurs when the individual seeks professional help and starts medication. the immediate and substantial relief from anxiety and cessation of negative thoughts following the medication indicate a positive shift in mental health. this resolution and the relief from previously overwhelming stressors suggest that the individual is no longer experiencing the high levels of stress that were present before treatment. the narrative highlights the effectiveness of the prescribed medication and the positive impact it had on the individual's mental state, ultimately indicating a transition from a stressed to a non-stressed condition."
"I've got a good handle on my triggers. I know how to prepare myself when I have to encounter a trigger and how to move past it without too much discomfort. That being said today I encountered an event that blindsided me. I was not prepared at all. I know its possible I will come across triggers without warning, but this was something that had not been a trigger before.",1,"the narrative describes an individual who typically has a good understanding and control over their stress triggers. however, they encountered an unexpected event that caught them off guard and caused significant discomfort. the mention of being ""blindsided"" and ""not prepared at all"" indicates a sudden and intense emotional response, which is a common indicator of stress. the fact that this event had not previously been a trigger but caused a strong reaction suggests a heightened state of vulnerability and sensitivity, both of which are indicative of stress. the individual's awareness of their usual coping mechanisms contrasts sharply with their reaction to this unforeseen event, highlighting the stress experienced due to the unpredictability and novelty of the situation."
"I am also not sure if I should press charges on my mother for stealing my identity, or even bother looking into the student loan fraud. Student loan fraud is incredibly difficult to prove, and reporting identity theft would be a lengthy process. The debt is paid and I almost feel like just running away and forgetting about it. I am 26 and truly terrified because, though I have been on my own before, I have never been completely alone or financially independent. I am shocked and horrified by everything that has happened to me in the last year.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the writer expresses uncertainty and confusion about pressing charges for identity theft and student loan fraud, which suggests a significant level of distress and indecision. the mention of the difficulties in proving student loan fraud and the lengthy process of reporting identity theft further underscores the overwhelming nature of their situation. the writer also conveys a desire to escape from their problems, indicating a high level of anxiety and a sense of being overwhelmed. their fear of being alone and financially independent at the age of 26, coupled with feelings of shock and horror about recent events, highlights a profound sense of insecurity and instability. these emotions and thoughts are typical indicators of stress, as they reflect a struggle to cope with significant life challenges and a pervasive sense of fear and uncertainty."
"My mother is a narcissist. A few months ago I pulled up my credit report and discovered that my mother had stolen my identity in 2015– but had just paid off the balance. I asked her about it and she admitted it without apologizing. A few weeks ago I was thinking about what I owe in student loans, and it wasn’t adding up. I asked her if she ever pulled out extra money for herself, and she snapped.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply troubling and stressful family dynamic, particularly involving betrayal and financial exploitation by a close family member, which is a significant source of stress. the discovery of identity theft by the mother, a figure typically associated with trust and protection, is a major stressor. the lack of remorse from the mother and her hostile reaction when questioned about student loans further exacerbates the sense of betrayal and emotional turmoil. these interactions indicate a pattern of manipulative and harmful behavior from the mother, contributing to ongoing stress. the narrator's preoccupation with financial discrepancies and the confrontational nature of their interactions are clear indicators of the psychological distress they are experiencing."
"I have panic attack after panic attack and I truly just don't know what to do anymore. No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted.",1,"the narrative describes a person experiencing continuous panic attacks, which are a clear indicator of acute stress. the individual expresses feelings of being misunderstood despite their attempts to communicate the severity of their mental state. the mention of intrusive thoughts, particularly about potential harm to loved ones and constant ""what if"" scenarios, further highlights the presence of anxiety. the description of their mind being active 24/7 and driving them insane indicates a relentless mental struggle. the fear of dying and concern for their family's safety are classic symptoms of anxiety and stress. the overall tone of sadness, fear, and exhaustion reinforces the depth of their distress, making it evident that the individual is grappling with significant psychological stress."
"I read somewhere that feeling like you can't swallow is a symptom of anxiety. It usually only happens when I take pills, but lately it's expanded to nearly everything I eat or drink. It helps if I'm moving or fidgeting with something, but my family has started noticing. It makes me avoid eating with others when I can, or just eating super slow. It's become a fear of choking or asphyxiating now.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress and anxiety. the individual describes a specific physical symptom—difficulty swallowing—that has expanded from a situational issue to a more pervasive problem. this symptom is a common manifestation of anxiety, where the body's stress response affects normal bodily functions. the person's need to move or fidget to alleviate the discomfort suggests a coping mechanism to manage their heightened anxiety levels. the avoidance of eating with others and the fear of choking or asphyxiating are also significant markers of stress, indicating how the anxiety is beginning to interfere with daily social interactions and routines. these behaviors and fears are consistent with anxiety disorders, where physical symptoms and avoidance behaviors can significantly impact a person's quality of life."
"I keep getting this... creeping/moving feeling in my stomach. Right below where my ribs part, maybe slightly to the right. I have no idea what it is but I've never had stomach issues with my anxiety. It just started in the past couple of weeks. Admittedly my anxiety has been a lot worse lately.",1,"the narrative indicates significant stress as evidenced by the physical symptoms described, such as the ""creeping/moving feeling"" in the stomach. these somatic complaints are often associated with heightened anxiety levels. the individual mentions a recent increase in anxiety, which correlates with the onset of the new physical sensation. this connection between increased anxiety and physical symptoms is a common manifestation of stress. the location of the sensation, described with specific details, suggests a preoccupation with bodily functions, which is typical in individuals experiencing stress. the narrative reflects a heightened awareness and concern about these new symptoms, further underscoring the stress response. overall, the description of physical discomfort combined with an acknowledgment of worsening anxiety provides clear indicators of stress."
"I hadn't realized until a year ago, but this gave me ptsd and shaped the way I interact with men and boys. Now I'm dating a boy who is very sweet, very understanding and such, but I often find myself thinking about ending it because his behavior feels too ""man-ish"" to me, and it makes me uncomfortable and scares me. It puts me in a very irritated state - a response to feeling threatened by men in my case - and often starts ""discourse"" between us. Luckily he is very understanding and we talked about it a lot, but whenever he asks me what he's doing that makes me uncomfortable, I can't answer, I can't put it into words, which means he can't change his behavior perfectly and that the cycle will start over again. I'm fighting as hard as I can against the effects of my ptsd on my relationship, as it is very important to me to make it work, but I know when we end it, it will be partly caused by it.",1,"the narrative describes a person who has been significantly impacted by a past traumatic event, leading to the development of ptsd. this trauma has altered their interactions with men and boys, creating a persistent sense of discomfort and fear. the individual is currently in a relationship with a supportive partner but struggles with feelings of irritation and threat, which are common symptoms of ptsd. their inability to articulate what specifically triggers their discomfort exacerbates the situation, creating a cycle of misunderstanding and stress. the effort to manage these ptsd symptoms while trying to maintain the relationship highlights the ongoing internal conflict and the emotional toll it takes. these elements collectively indicate a high level of stress and psychological distress."
"I made some dumb decisions 1-2 years back. I took out some loans i shouldn't have, and i'm paying for it dearly now. I know it was dumb, but i don't feel like i deserve to starve for it, but thats just my opinion. On the other hand, i also know that i am not owed anything, and i am deeply ashamed of myself almost every day. Honestly, i am on a verge of a mental breakdown.",1,"the narrative displays several indicators of stress, which are evident through the individual's expression of regret, self-criticism, and emotional turmoil. the mention of ""dumb decisions"" and ""deeply ashamed of myself almost every day"" highlights a significant level of self-reproach and guilt, which are common symptoms of stress. the financial strain from taking out loans and the resultant hardship of ""paying for it dearly"" further exacerbates the individual's stress levels. the phrase ""i do not feel like i deserve to starve for it"" indicates a sense of injustice and helplessness, contributing to emotional distress. finally, the admission of being ""on the verge of a mental breakdown"" is a clear and direct indicator of severe stress, suggesting that the individual is struggling to cope with their current situation. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative steeped in stress and psychological strain."
"Alright so, for my entire life I've been a straight-A student. High honor roll every time. I never expected any less and neither did my parents, teachers, friends, etc. Over the past year (8th grade) I've developed anxiety, depression, and OCD. (Not self diagnosed.)",1,"the narrative indicates significant psychological distress. the individual describes a history of high academic achievement and the pressure of maintaining those standards, which is a common stressor. the mention of anxiety, depression, and ocd—conditions that are not self-diagnosed—suggests they have been evaluated by a professional, underscoring the seriousness of their mental health struggles. the context of transitioning through a critical educational period (8th grade) adds to the stress, as this is a time when academic and social pressures intensify. the narrative reflects feelings of overwhelming expectations from parents, teachers, and friends, which are typical stress indicators. the combination of high expectations and the onset of mental health issues is a clear signal of the stress the individual is experiencing."
"Was looking at therapies for my gf and this stood out. Love any feedback from anyone who has used this. She's going to start Monday at 5 mg and go up from there.

"I'd like to note that I have had a couple close individuals look at my emails, evidence, etc since the last court date. I'm not that crazy, but I showed them the emails because I wanted to make sure they were real. The emails, evidence, and notes are all real. I checked my phone history, and the phone calls to the advocate and office are all logged and sufficient in length to indicate that an actual conversation occurred. I never doubted reality before the abuse, and I have never done so outside of the abuse.",1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of stress. the writer expresses a need for validation from close individuals to confirm the reality of their emails and evidence, suggesting a significant level of self-doubt and anxiety. the repeated emphasis on checking and rechecking details, such as phone call logs and email authenticity, points to a heightened state of vigilance and possibly obsessive behaviors. the mention of abuse as a turning point in their perception of reality indicates a traumatic experience that has likely exacerbated their stress levels. the overall tone of the narrative is one of uncertainty and heightened alertness, which are common psychological responses to prolonged stress and trauma."
"He didn't remember, and didn't care that they weren't in the file any longer. He said he had 400 cases on his docket and couldn't remember something so trivial.

The Prosecutor was aggressive, dismissive, and belittling.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a prosecutor who is dismissive, aggressive, and belittling. while these interactions could be stressful, the individual recounting the experience does not exhibit classic signs of stress in their own behavior or emotions. instead, they describe their feelings in a detached manner and mention becoming defensive, which can be a normal reaction to feeling undermined or belittled. the focus is more on the prosecutor's behavior rather than the narrator's internal emotional state. there is no indication of overwhelming stress symptoms such as anxiety, panic, or distress that would typically be present if the individual were experiencing significant stress. the narrative lacks expressions of intense emotional turmoil or physical symptoms that are often associated with high levels of stress."
"I am in a very bad situation, stuck in Nashville, with no friends or family and no money. I have some personal belongings that I am trying to sell, but can't see myself raising more than $100. Food stamps don't come in for another two weeks. I am 19. The plan is to hop on a Greyhound to Atlanta, and stay at Covenant House.",1,"the narrative indicates significant stress through several clear indicators. the individual describes being in a ""very bad situation,"" which sets a tone of distress and urgency. being ""stuck in nashville"" without any support network of friends or family highlights feelings of isolation and helplessness. financial strain is evident as they mention having no money and the inability to raise more than $100 by selling personal belongings, which underscores a sense of desperation and immediate need. the delay in receiving food stamps for another two weeks exacerbates their anxiety about basic survival needs. being only 19 years old adds to the stress, as it suggests a lack of life experience and resources to effectively manage such a crisis. the plan to take a greyhound to atlanta and seek refuge at covenant house, a shelter for homeless youth, further illustrates the severity of their situation and the extreme measures they feel compelled to take. these elements collectively paint a picture of acute stress stemming from financial hardship, lack of social support, and uncertainty about the future."
"I am still rather lacking in social skills. Writing this is gradually helping me calm down. Does anybody else feel this way too? Several years ago I just gave up on life, not in the way suicidal people do, but, I just stopped putting in any effort to achieve any goals or plans since it wasn’t working, I stopped standing up for myself or resisting other people, I stopped doing anything that was hard or required effort or that caused me emotional pain, that triggered panic attacks. Not because I wanted to die but because I wanted to live, to live a life free of those burdens.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, evident in the author's admission of lacking social skills and the need to write as a means of calming down. the mention of giving up on life several years ago, not in a suicidal sense but by ceasing to put effort into goals and plans, highlights a profound sense of hopelessness and emotional fatigue. the avoidance of activities that are hard or cause emotional pain, as well as the experience of panic attacks, further underscore a state of high stress. the author's desire to live a life free of burdens indicates a struggle with overwhelming stressors and a yearning for relief. these elements collectively suggest a narrative deeply embedded in stress, characterized by avoidance behaviors, emotional exhaustion, and a search for coping mechanisms."
"It is quite annoying. I get diarrhea when I get panic attacks and then need to shower thoroughly to get myself cleaned up because it is disgusting. I also get hypochondriac thoughts and sometimes panic so badly I call 911 and have an ambulance sent. Thankfully I have not done that today. This is so annoying, this fight-or-flight response.",1,"the narrative describes a series of physical and psychological symptoms that are commonly associated with stress. the individual mentions experiencing diarrhea during panic attacks, which is a physiological response often triggered by high stress levels. the need to shower thoroughly indicates a heightened sense of discomfort and a desire for cleanliness, possibly linked to stress-induced compulsions. the mention of hypochondriac thoughts and the act of calling 911 for an ambulance during severe panic episodes highlight the acute anxiety and fear that accompany their stress. the repeated use of the word ""annoying"" reflects frustration and a sense of being overwhelmed by these stress responses. overall, the combination of physical symptoms, anxious thoughts, and emergency behaviors are clear indicators of significant stress."
"My best friend died last year, of a rare type of bacteria that killed him very quickly, a contagious disease. He was a year younger than me. I am still relatively young but also starting to get old, my age is in between somewhere. I can feel the medicine starting to work and I am not as anxious now. I have been typing for over half an hour.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, particularly through the mention of a traumatic event—the death of a best friend from a rare, rapidly fatal bacterial infection. the suddenness and contagious nature of the disease likely exacerbated feelings of vulnerability and fear. the author reflects on their own age, indicating a possible existential concern and heightened awareness of mortality. the reference to feeling the medicine starting to work suggests that the individual is undergoing treatment for anxiety, which is a common response to prolonged stress. the act of typing for over half an hour might be a coping mechanism to manage stress or anxiety. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress, as the author is grappling with loss, existential thoughts, and the need for medication to manage their anxiety."
"I am a very strange person in more ways than one. Everything I have written here is top secret classified information, do not disclose it to anyone outside this subreddit, you are all sworn to secrecy. Yes I know Reddit posts are viewable by the public, in retrospect maybe I should not post this because of privacy concerns. Too bad, I am going to do it anyway because I feel like it. Good night and good luck.",0,"the narrative exhibits a whimsical and somewhat playful tone, suggesting a lack of serious concern or distress. the author's self-description as ""a very strange person"" and the playful warning about secrecy indicate a lighthearted approach to sharing personal information. the mention of privacy concerns is acknowledged but dismissed casually, reflecting a carefree attitude rather than anxiety or stress. the sign-off with ""good night and good luck"" further reinforces a relaxed and nonchalant demeanor. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of stress such as tension, worry, or urgency, instead presenting a laid-back and humorous perspective."
"I need to be my own person, however flawed I am. My panic attack ended at least 20 minutes ago, now. I think that is the end of this post. What more is there to say, other than, I am sorry for writing something so long? It is just who I am, I write long things.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is self-aware and acknowledges their own flaws. they mention experiencing a panic attack, but it is described as having ended, suggesting a resolution or return to a baseline state. the tone of the narrative is reflective and somewhat apologetic, but there is no indication of ongoing distress or overwhelming stress. the person seems to be processing their emotions and behaviors in a rational manner, which is not typically indicative of someone currently experiencing high levels of stress. instead, they are expressing a desire for self-acceptance and understanding. the use of phrases like ""i need to be my own person"" and ""it is just who i am"" suggests a level of acceptance and self-compassion, further supporting the absence of acute stress."
Today I have $4. And no gas. I have to pick my son up from school in half an hour. My wife and my phones are due tomorrow. And we have cricket so if its not paid.,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, particularly through the depiction of financial strain and time pressure. the individual mentions having only $4 and no gas, highlighting a precarious financial situation that can lead to heightened anxiety. the urgency of needing to pick up their son from school in half an hour adds a layer of immediate pressure and potential worry about failing to fulfill parental responsibilities. additionally, the mention of upcoming phone bills due tomorrow, with the implication that the phones will be disconnected if not paid, further compounds the stress by introducing concerns about losing a critical means of communication. these elements collectively point to a scenario where the individual is juggling multiple stressors, each contributing to an overall sense of being overwhelmed and anxious."

Why fix the leak when the rubber mallet driving the cork into the hole disturbs the family when the damp doesn’t bother them quite so much at the moment. Never mind the water is rotting the floorboards. Never mind the mold growing in corners. Never mind how sick I get from exposure. Now here comes the real question: Do I abandon the ship or go down with it?,1,"the narrative presents a metaphorical scenario that reflects significant underlying stress. the imagery of a leaking ship, rotting floorboards, and growing mold symbolizes persistent problems that are being neglected. the mention of a rubber mallet disturbing the family suggests a fear of causing further distress or conflict by addressing the issues. the repeated phrase ""never mind"" highlights a sense of resignation and hopelessness, indicating that the problems are being ignored despite their severity. the narrator's sickness from exposure to mold adds a physical dimension to the stress, emphasizing the personal toll it takes. the final question about abandoning the ship or going down with it reveals a profound internal conflict and a feeling of being trapped in a deteriorating situation. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress, characterized by neglect, resignation, and a struggle with difficult decisions."

"I forgot about it until I noticed one day that I saw a co workers name written on a receipt that was for a room sale (we stapled the receipt of the room sale on the back of the vip room tracking sheet to keep up with sales) I asked the manager what that was about. He told me that that is how the bookkeepers keep track of who sold which room so they will get credit and the surcharges of the sale. So I explained to him I was never told of this and explained that in my six month tenure I had never received anything. He then told me he would help me go through each sale with me to make sure I get the amount I was supposed to get. I was fired a week after that conversation because an entertainer tipped me 80 bucks when I made her 3500 I never complained or anything about it, but they fired me for not splitting that 80 bucks with everyone.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events at work involving a misunderstanding about sales tracking and subsequent termination. the individual recounts a situation where they were unaware of a procedure for tracking sales credits, which led to a conversation with their manager. the manager's response was helpful, offering to go through the sales records to ensure proper credit was given. however, the individual was fired shortly after for a different reason, which was not related to the initial issue discussed. while the situation involves a significant and potentially distressing event (being fired), the tone and structure of the narrative do not convey strong emotions or indications of stress. the individual recounts the events in a straightforward, factual manner without expressing feelings of anxiety, frustration, or other stress-related emotions. this suggests that the person is reflecting on the events with a level of detachment or acceptance, rather than experiencing ongoing stress or emotional turmoil."
"My wife suffers from chronic migraines, of which, she is allergic to most of the medications they have out there for this. Our options for relief comes in the form of Methadone that is the only thing that helps, I know what a lot of you are thinking and no we do not do drugs or anything that the stigma of methadone has with it. I paid for her meds no problem for a while while she was filing for disability which many of you know is a very lengthy process. While I was working there I heard rumors that there was a commission system set up for vip hosts that includes giving the surcharges of the bottle sales to the vip host. I asked each manager and none of them could say one way or the other (strange right?).",0,"the narrative reflects an individual dealing with significant challenges, particularly concerning their wife's chronic migraines and the complexities surrounding her medication and disability process. despite these difficulties, the tone of the narrative suggests a pragmatic and proactive approach rather than one overwhelmed by stress. the author describes their actions in a matter-of-fact manner, focusing on solutions like paying for medications and seeking clarity on workplace policies. the mention of managing financial responsibilities and navigating bureaucratic processes indicates resilience and resourcefulness. there is no evident expression of emotional distress or signs of being overwhelmed, which are typical indicators of stress. instead, the narrative maintains a composed and problem-solving attitude, suggesting the individual is coping effectively with the situation."
"However, because the other couple’s share comes out to just under what they owe me, my fiancé and I had planned to keep their share and forgive the rest of their debt. I tried to deposit the check, but since it has all four of our names on it, I was told all four of us have to be present. So I had to get in contact with them. Obviously they weren’t happy that I wanted to keep their share. The way they see it, because they paid the deposit in the first place, the money is theirs.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a financial disagreement between the author, their fiancé, and another couple. while the scenario involves some conflict, it lacks significant indicators of stress. the author details their plan to keep the other couple's share of money and forgive the rest of their debt, which suggests a rational and thought-out approach. the need to get in contact with the other couple due to a banking requirement is a logistical issue rather than a stressor. although the other couple's displeasure is mentioned, the author does not express personal distress or emotional turmoil. instead, the tone remains factual and focused on resolving the issue. the absence of language indicating anxiety, frustration, or overwhelmed feelings supports the classification. overall, the narrative reflects a challenging situation but does not convey the psychological markers typically associated with stress."
"It’s why I was okay with paying so much rent for them in the first place. But I don’t have a job anymore. I’m trying to get one again, but I have historically had a hard time finding employment. I have my own rent and bills to pay. I need to get into therapy, and I want to go back to school someday.",0,"the narrative reflects a series of challenges and aspirations that are common in many people's lives. while there are mentions of difficulties such as unemployment and financial responsibilities, the tone remains focused on problem-solving and future goals. the author is actively seeking employment and has clear intentions to pursue therapy and education, which indicates a proactive and goal-oriented mindset. this approach is typically associated with resilience rather than overwhelming stress. the desire to return to school and the acknowledgment of the need for therapy suggest a level of self-awareness and forward-thinking that are often absent in narratives characterized by high stress. overall, the narrative shows a balanced perspective, with the individual acknowledging their difficulties but also demonstrating a capacity to plan and strive for improvement."
"But whatever. I got paid today, so food is no longer an emergency and I wouldn't feel right accepting your gifts of compassion. Thank you all so much thoughfor your efforts.

Thanks again and god bless.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of gratitude and relief, indicating that the author has recently experienced a positive change in their situation. the mention of getting paid and no longer considering food an emergency suggests a resolution of immediate financial stress. although the author acknowledges not being in a good financial position overall, the expression of thanks and blessings, as well as the decision to decline further assistance, indicate a state of coping rather than ongoing stress. the narrative's tone is appreciative and hopeful, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"But it took me months afterward to end it. I remember him screaming at me, calling me stupid, calling me a moody bitch when I got frustrated at him for screaming and insulting me, threatening to break up with me, holding his “love” for me over my head when I wasn’t doing things his way, getting drunk and high and cheating on me and then coercing me into helping him fake a piss test, and on and on and on.... And the whole time I knew he was being an abusive asshole and I *still stayed. * I had absolutely no reason not to leave him, and it was 100% in my power to end things between us. But I didn’t.",0,"the narrative describes a tumultuous and abusive relationship, where the author details experiences of being screamed at, insulted, manipulated, and coerced by their partner. despite recognizing the abusive behavior and acknowledging their power to leave, the author chose to stay in the relationship. while the content is undoubtedly distressing and highlights significant emotional turmoil, the tone of the narrative suggests a retrospective reflection rather than an immediate sense of stress. the author appears to be processing past events with a sense of clarity and self-awareness, which may indicate that they are no longer in the midst of the stressful situation and are instead reflecting on it from a distance. this reflective tone, combined with the detailed recounting of events, suggests that the author has gained some degree of emotional distance and insight into their past experiences."
"I needed to run some errands, but it was a Saturday afternoon when stores were usually too busy for me, but I felt so great I decided to try it. I went into a busy store and actually waited in line to pay infont of a very obnoxious couple who didn't understAnd personal space. I was totally fine. I couldn't believe it. In other situations i'd have to avoid the store all together or walk around the store until the line went down or I'd get dizzy and start freaking out, get to the point of feeling like I'm going to pass out.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who typically finds running errands on a busy saturday afternoon stressful, particularly due to the crowded environment and personal space issues. however, in this instance, the person felt great and decided to face the challenge. despite encountering a situation that would usually trigger stress, such as standing in line in front of an obnoxious couple, the individual remained calm and did not experience their usual symptoms of stress, like dizziness or the urge to avoid the store. the ability to handle the situation without the typical stress responses indicates a state of well-being and resilience. this contrast between their usual reactions and their current state suggests a significant reduction in stress, highlighting their capability to manage situations that previously would have been overwhelming."

After months of looking for a job, I finally got one but not in time to pay my rent because of that I got a ton of fee's added to my rent for being late. I have been served an eviction and have pay over $1000 by august the 15th. While I have half of that I' am trying to pick up some web design clients--- I was a web designer before I went back to school.

You are more than welcome to message me about any questions you have.",0,"the narrative describes the role of a caseworker who is responsible for assisting over 300 homeless men, a task that certainly involves significant responsibility and fluctuating demands. however, the tone of the narrative is composed and proactive. the individual offers practical advice and encourages others to reach out with questions, indicating a sense of control and confidence in their ability to manage the situation. there are no explicit expressions of feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or distressed. instead, the focus is on providing help and solutions, which suggests a level of comfort and competence in their role. the narrative reflects a person who is managing their responsibilities effectively and does not exhibit typical indicators of stress such as frustration, helplessness, or emotional exhaustion."
"I am not, except the one that exists in my mind. We, our nation, are at a very precarious point in our history. All generations have said that, I am sure.

Anyway, that is my rant/prayer/I don't know what.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful contemplation on societal issues rather than personal stress. the author expresses concern about the juxtaposition of wealth and poverty, indicating a broader social awareness rather than individual distress. the use of phrases like ""we, our nation"" and the focus on historical context suggest a collective rather than personal perspective. the tone is reflective and philosophical, showing a deep concern for societal conditions rather than an immediate, personal emotional response. while the narrative contains elements of frustration and worry, these are directed outwardly towards societal conditions rather than inwardly towards personal experiences. such expressions are more indicative of a thoughtful critique of social inequalities rather than a manifestation of personal stress."
"I fully expect to be asked for a higher deposit due to my rental history in the past three years. It is hard to decide.

Once I store stuff.",0,"the narrative reflects a logical and methodical approach to solving a practical problem. the individual is weighing their options and considering the financial implications of each choice. this type of problem-solving and planning is indicative of someone who is managing their situation rather than being overwhelmed by it. the absence of emotional language or expressions of distress suggests that the person is not experiencing significant stress. instead, they are focused on making a rational decision about their living situation, which implies a level of control and composure."
"My boyfriend and I are out of options, night has fallen and we have no place to stay for the night. We're terrified beyond all reason. Neither of us has been this bad off before, and all nearby shelters have closed their doors for the night. All we have are two suitcases with our clothes and our phones. Where do we sleep in the city?",1,"the narrative reveals a situation marked by acute distress and anxiety. the individuals are facing homelessness for the night, a circumstance that naturally induces high levels of stress. the mention of being ""terrified beyond all reason"" underscores their emotional turmoil. the fact that they have never been ""this bad off before"" indicates a significant deviation from their usual state of well-being, contributing to their heightened stress levels. the closed shelters add a layer of helplessness and urgency, as they have no immediate solution for a safe place to sleep. their limited resources, consisting only of two suitcases and their phones, amplify their vulnerability. such a scenario is fraught with uncertainty and fear, which are classic indicators of stress."
"So to the point, I’m almost 30 and I’m starting to think maybe I *am* this anxious person who says stupid things and gives off the ‘Don’t mess with me’ vibe I apparently give off when I’m anxious. I’m painfully awkward. I unintentionally say really rude things and I don’t even realize it until way later. I’m socially inept and it’s frustrating that all this work I’ve continually been doing for my mental health has been for nothing. I feel like I should just succumb to accepting that the good times are few and far between and this person I am when I’m unstable mentally is just who I am.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-awareness and frustration, which are often indicative of stress. the individual describes themselves as anxious, awkward, and socially inept, highlighting a negative self-perception that can be a common symptom of stress. they mention saying rude things unintentionally and realizing it much later, which points to social anxiety and the stress that comes with worrying about social interactions. the feeling of frustration with the lack of progress despite continuous efforts for mental health improvement suggests a sense of hopelessness and exhaustion, both of which are strong indicators of chronic stress. the resignation to the idea that good times are rare and the unstable version of themselves might be their true self further underscores a profound sense of despair and stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of an individual struggling significantly with stress and its impact on their mental health and social life."
"I picked at it yesterday and made it worse. What do I do about this? I'm still convinced there's something there but nothing I've tried has worked. I've tried flossing and even using a small needle to dislodge whatever I _think_ is in there but it still hurts long after it's healed and it still bothers me like crazy. FYI I have trich and dermo as symptoms of OCD, anxiety, and body dysmorphia and is the main reason why I pick at myself",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress, most notably the obsessive and compulsive behaviors described. the individual mentions engaging in repetitive and harmful actions, such as picking at their skin and using a needle, which are symptomatic of underlying anxiety and body dysmorphia. the mention of trichotillomania (trich) and dermatillomania (dermo) as symptoms of ocd further emphasizes the presence of stress-related disorders. the person's ongoing distress about the perceived issue, despite attempts to resolve it, indicates a high level of preoccupation and discomfort. the use of phrases like ""bothers me like crazy"" and the continuous focus on the unresolved problem highlight the persistent and intrusive nature of their stress. these behaviors and thoughts are consistent with the psychological profile of someone experiencing significant stress and anxiety."
"They have changed since we first met. I don't feel attracted to the person they actually are compared to who they seemed to be when we first met. I know as you get to know people more, you learn more facets of their personality, but they just aren't a great person honestly... When we first met, they were incredibly sensitive and sweet. They portrayed themselves as a feminist (which is important, but not an end-all be-all for me), they were very in-touch with their emotions, and just came across like someone I'd love to be around.",0,"the narrative describes a change in perception of another person over time. initially, the individual found the person to be sensitive, sweet, and emotionally in-tune, qualities that made them attractive. however, as they got to know them better, they realized that the person was not as great as they initially seemed. while this realization might be disappointing or disheartening, it doesn't necessarily indicate stress. instead, it reflects a common experience of disillusionment when initial impressions do not match reality. the writer acknowledges the natural process of getting to know someone better and does not express overwhelming emotional distress or anxiety. the tone remains relatively calm and matter-of-fact, suggesting a rational evaluation rather than an emotional crisis."
"I don't know what to do. We have two weeks. My girlfriend is a single mom with two kids, but her ex-spouse is primary and she pays him child support. We are both struggling to get sustainable work, currently jobless, will lose the kids, and simply can't get funds to continue living in the rental we're currently in. Time is ticking and I'm very scared.",1,"the narrative exhibits multiple indicators of stress. the writer expresses uncertainty and fear, evident in phrases like ""i do not know what to do"" and ""i am very scared."" the mention of a tight deadline, ""we have two weeks,"" adds to the urgency and pressure of the situation. the complexity of the girlfriend's family dynamics, including her being a single mom with two kids and paying child support to her ex-spouse, further complicates their circumstances. both individuals are described as struggling to find sustainable work and currently jobless, which heightens financial insecurity. the fear of losing the kids and the inability to afford their current rental exacerbates the stress. the combination of financial, familial, and time-related pressures are classic indicators of a high-stress situation."
"I then confronted my parents and finally the walls came tumbling down. It wasn't the first time I asked them about it, I did so on at least 3 different occasions throughout my twenties. Well after 2 weeks I got written confirmation, when my parents handed me a note from 1986, where they wrote down, what I told them, when I talked about it afterwards again and again. I addition to this, the memories came back from when I was about 12-15, when my parents used to lock me up in my room and bathroom and made me learn my latin vocabularies on my knees, only being allowed to eat, when I was finnished. That was something I kinda always knew happened, but I thought it was just on a few occasions and well - I was such a rascal, how else could they have handled me?",0,"the narrative describes a confrontation with parents about past events and the subsequent realization of those events' impact. despite the emotionally charged content, the individual recounts these experiences in a matter-of-fact tone, suggesting a level of detachment. the use of phrases like ""finally the walls came tumbling down"" indicates a resolution rather than ongoing distress. the narrative also includes a rationalization of the parents' actions, referring to themselves as a ""rascal"" and implying acceptance of the past treatment. these elements suggest that the individual has processed these memories to a point where they do not currently induce significant stress. the overall tone and structure of the narrative reflect a sense of closure and understanding rather than ongoing emotional turmoil."
I'm living in my car right now which sucks because the radiator just got a hole in it and now I can't keep the AC on at night. I'm working a full time job but I'm not making enough to rent an apartment or even a hotel. What I need is some food. Something portable that won't need refrigeration. I'm former Army so I'm used to MRE's but I don't have anywhere local to get them.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. living in a car is inherently a challenging and unstable situation, which is compounded by the recent damage to the radiator, making it impossible to use the ac at night. this detail suggests discomfort and potential health risks due to heat, which can exacerbate stress levels. the individual also mentions working full-time yet not earning enough to afford stable housing, highlighting financial strain and feelings of inadequacy or frustration. the need for portable, non-refrigerated food further underscores the precariousness of their living conditions. the reference to being former army and used to mre's might indicate resilience, but also suggests a fallback on survival strategies learned in high-stress environments. all these factors combined point to a high level of stress due to financial instability, inadequate living conditions, and basic needs not being met."
I don't post that much so sorry about the formatting! As a preface my mum has always been protective of me. But the main drama started on boxing day (26th December). She misunderstood me and thought I wasn't going to see her before I moved back to University so she locked herself in her room and began to cry. She even told me to pack up my stuff and move to my boyfriend's.,1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. firstly, the writer apologizes for the formatting, which can suggest a level of anxiety about how their message is perceived. the context of the situation is emotionally charged, as it involves a significant misunderstanding with the writer's mother, who is described as protective. the event occurring on boxing day adds to the emotional weight, as holidays often carry heightened expectations and stress. the mother's reaction of locking herself in her room and crying indicates a high level of emotional distress, which likely impacts the writer as well. the suggestion for the writer to move to their boyfriend's adds a layer of urgency and tension to the situation. these elements combined point to an environment filled with emotional strain and stress for the writer."
"I'm stuck on my couch alone with bronchitis. I'm passing out to sleep every hour, and obviously not safe to cook or drive to one of the few open places on this holiday. Due to my bad financial situation after a job was delayed by a month, and another large medical bill, ordering out isn't possible. If anyone in the San Bernardino area would be willing to drop by some soup or hot easy to eat food, I'd appreciate it so much. Thank you and Happy Christmas Eve.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the author is dealing with bronchitis, a physical illness that often contributes to emotional and mental strain. being stuck alone on the couch implies a sense of isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. the mention of passing out to sleep every hour suggests severe fatigue and possible concern about their safety, adding to the overall stress level. the financial difficulties described, such as a job delay and a large medical bill, contribute to the stress by creating a sense of insecurity and helplessness. the inability to cook or drive further limits their options, increasing their dependence on others. the plea for assistance highlights a feeling of desperation and the urgency of their situation. all these elements together paint a picture of an individual under significant stress, trying to cope with multiple challenging circumstances simultaneously."
"My boyfriend and I got into a really bad fight the other night and it ended with him throwing a full waste bin over my head while I was sitting on our bed. To clarify- he threw the trash in the waste bin over my head, the actual bin didn't hit me. Although, even so, I know it's not great. He's apologized but I'm still feeling really shaken up. I'm not sure what to do.",1,"the narrative describes a highly distressing event involving a physical altercation between the individual and her boyfriend. the incident of having trash thrown over her head, even if the bin itself did not hit her, is a clear act of aggression and disrespect, which can be profoundly unsettling. the writer expresses ongoing emotional turmoil, evidenced by feeling ""really shaken up"" despite her boyfriend's apology. this persistent emotional disturbance is a strong indicator of stress. the uncertainty about what to do next further highlights her inner conflict and stress, as she grapples with the implications of the incident on her relationship and personal well-being. these elements collectively underscore the narrative's portrayal of a person under significant stress."
"I did do a couple years of college but in the midst of it, I developed a physical disability (blood clots in the legs) and was forced to drop out. Naturally, this difficult transition wasn't made any easier when mom began calling me to claim I was faking being disabled because I'd seen the actually disabled people in/around my life, how easy they had it not having to work, and I just wanted to do that. For financial reasons, I haven't been able to return to college, but I genuinely want to if it ever becomes feasible. Last year, I finally found a decent therapist and started seeing her every other week. That has helped some, keeping my depression in check and teaching me techniques to rein in my anxiety.",0,"the narrative details a significant life disruption due to the development of a physical disability and the subsequent impact on the author's education and family dynamics. the mention of blood clots in the legs leading to dropping out of college highlights a major life stressor. additionally, the mother's accusations of faking the disability could potentially contribute to feelings of frustration and invalidation. despite these challenges, the author shows resilience and proactive behavior by seeking therapy, which has been beneficial in managing depression and anxiety. the narrative reflects a journey of coping and adaptation rather than an overwhelming sense of stress, suggesting that the individual has found some stability and support through therapeutic intervention. the desire to return to college also indicates forward-looking optimism and goal-setting, further pointing to a managed state of stress rather than acute distress."
"I still have issues with writing, driving, standing up to people/for myself, and with the aforementioned complex PTSD. It's generally triggered by loud confrontation. I do have a great fiancee these days. She has helped me a ton. It's the first genuinely healthy romantic relationship I've ever had.",0,"the narrative describes ongoing challenges with writing, driving, standing up to people, and dealing with complex ptsd, particularly triggered by loud confrontations. however, the mention of a supportive and healthy romantic relationship with a fiancée indicates a significant positive influence and emotional support in the author's life. this balance between acknowledging difficulties and highlighting a strong, positive relationship suggests resilience and an ability to manage stressors effectively. the presence of a healthy relationship is a crucial protective factor against stress, contributing to the overall sense of well-being and stability, which are key indicators of not being in a state of high stress."
"When I was 17, my mom turned her attacks on my writing into high gear. She constantly berated me about how pointless, worthless, stupid and childish it was to write. How I'd never make it as a writer. How I'd be poor and alone. How (again) I needed to stop doing ""childish things"" like writing (and any other hobby/passion she decided to attack that day) and grow up.",0,"the narrative recounts a past experience involving significant criticism and negative feedback from a parent, which might be expected to induce stress. however, it appears to be a reflection on a past event rather than an expression of current stress. the individual describes specific instances of verbal attacks on their writing and hobbies, but there is no indication of ongoing emotional turmoil or present-day distress. instead, the tone suggests a recounting of events with a degree of detachment. the absence of present tense language or expressions of current emotional struggle suggests that the person may have processed or moved past the described experiences. thus, while the events described could be stressful, the narrative does not convey ongoing stress or emotional distress at the time of writing."
"My intelligent and self-worth were constantly, viciously attacked. Eventually, I gave up on school, I lapsed into depression (was suicidal for awhile) and just stumbled through each day in a daze. My grades went from straight A's to D's and F's at midterms that I'd barely get up to low C's at the last minute.

"-What are you gonna do with that strange looking super shiny thing over there? -That's not really going anywhere *near* me, **is** it??? ? -Wish I could go on my phone right now and play a silly game to distract myself but I've just got to sit here while Dr. fiddles around in my mouth. -I love the way the drill makes a sound like kittens.",0,"the narrative reflects a playful and somewhat whimsical tone despite being in a situation that could be potentially stressful, such as a dental appointment. the use of humor and lighthearted expressions, like referring to the drill sound as ""like kittens,"" suggests a coping mechanism that is effective in reducing anxiety. the desire to play a game on the phone to distract oneself is a common, non-stressful way to pass time and indicates a normal level of discomfort rather than high stress. overall, the narrative lacks markers of significant distress, such as expressions of intense fear, panic, or overwhelming worry, which are more typical indicators of stress. instead, the individual appears to be managing the situation with a mix of curiosity, mild discomfort, and humor."
"I don't know why this happened, but I use to have these really bad panic attacks up until about a decade ago. Since then I've been having what feels like one long one. For 9 years I've been in a constant state of panic. It's not as severe as the full blown ones but I'm always short of breath, jittery, with an increased heart rate, a bit warm and super aware of my surroundings. At times I feel like I'm one loud noise away from pulling a seizure or losing consciousness and if I take my mind off my breathing I would stop.",1,"the narrative describes a prolonged experience of anxiety and panic symptoms, which are clear indicators of stress. the individual mentions having had severe panic attacks in the past and now experiencing a continuous state of panic for nine years. this chronic condition includes symptoms such as shortness of breath, jitteriness, increased heart rate, feeling warm, and heightened awareness of surroundings. these symptoms are consistent with the physiological responses associated with stress and anxiety. the person's fear of losing consciousness or having a seizure and the need to constantly monitor their breathing further illustrate the pervasive and debilitating nature of their stress. these aspects are typical indicators of chronic stress and anxiety, which can significantly impact one's quality of life and mental health."
"My mother has always been a difficult person to talk with. She is extremely stubborn, and I have never seen her consider another person’s suggestion or opinion. She usually considers helpful advice or offers of assistance to be personal attacks. When having a conversation, she doesn’t listen to the other person, but only waits for her next turn to speak. She tends to obsess about a single topic and will refuse talk about anything else.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging relationship with the author's mother, who is depicted as stubborn, unyielding, and dismissive of others' opinions. while these characteristics can certainly create frustration and tension, the narrative lacks indicators of the author's personal stress response. the author provides a detached and factual account of their mother's behavior without expressing emotional distress, anxiety, or signs of feeling overwhelmed. the tone remains consistent and composed, focusing on descriptive aspects rather than emotional reactions. typical indicators of stress, such as feelings of helplessness, irritability, or anxiety, are absent in this narrative, suggesting the author is more focused on recounting their observations rather than expressing personal stress."
"My mom has a degenerative neurological disease, and can barely walk, bathe, or feed herself anymore. Her most problematic symptom is a movement disorder, but she also has declining mental capacity (but not much confusion/forgetfulness). She either needs to receive in home care or be moved to an assisted living facility as soon as possible. My brother and I made an appointment to have her assessed by the regional health authority at the end of the month. She moved back to her hometown a few years ago, and my brother and I can’t take time off work or afford travel, so we can’t be there.",1,"the narrative describes a highly stressful situation where the individual is dealing with their mother's severe degenerative neurological disease. the mother's inability to perform basic activities such as walking, bathing, or feeding herself indicates a significant caregiving burden. the mention of her declining mental capacity adds to the complexity and emotional strain. the urgency of needing to arrange in-home care or an assisted living facility highlights the immediate and pressing nature of the problem. the logistical challenges of coordinating care from a distance, combined with the inability to take time off work or afford travel, exacerbate the stress. the overall tone reflects a sense of helplessness and concern for the mother's well-being, which are common indicators of stress in caregiving situations."
"I don't know if that's true or if my brain just can't find where all of that is supposed to fit in with this. I don't know if anyone knows what to advise here or if anything even could be, but it's just all so much. I feel like I have poison blood. TL:DR - one more straw added the family history of sexual abuse but my brothers abuse has thrown off my memories of my own childhood. It's all too complex and of course no one in the family will talk to me about it and my SO has no clue how to help me either, and I don't blame her.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of confusion and overwhelming emotions, which are clear indicators of stress. the individual expresses uncertainty about their thoughts and feelings, suggesting cognitive dissonance and difficulty processing complex emotions. phrases like ""it is just all so much"" and ""i feel like i have poison blood"" indicate a profound sense of being overwhelmed and experiencing distress. the mention of a family history of sexual abuse and the impact on their memories further highlights significant trauma and unresolved issues, which are common sources of chronic stress. the lack of support from family and the significant other’s inability to help exacerbates the individual's sense of isolation and helplessness, both of which are strong indicators of stress. overall, the narrative reveals multiple layers of emotional and psychological strain, characteristic of someone experiencing significant stress."
"aaaa sorry I feel so dumb for messing up like that, I hate when people lie and I really hope I don't come across like that to you but now I just sound desperate? I'm s o r r y I don't think he'll be online for a while but maybe in a few hours you could try and talk to him about it hello?",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of self-criticism and worry, which are typical indicators of stress. the author repeatedly apologizes, indicating a sense of guilt or fear of judgment. the use of phrases like ""i feel so dumb"" and ""i hate when people lie"" suggests internal conflict and distress over perceived mistakes or misunderstandings. the concern about sounding desperate further emphasizes anxiety about how they are perceived by others. the fragmented and somewhat disjointed nature of the narrative, along with the uncertainty about future actions (""i do not think he'll be online for a while""), highlights a preoccupation with the situation and an inability to find closure or resolution, all of which are consistent with stress."
"All I have from them is a roof over a head and sometimes food that suits my diet. They won’t talk to me about my problem, they won’t lend me a hand to find a job, they won’t support me with my uni, they won’t even lend me a car to drive to doctors. All I keep hearing is to: go talk to doctors if I’m ill and get antidepressants if I’m depressed. Not realising that neither one will solve my problem. So I thought that maybe someone could help me out with this, maybe someone has similar experience.",1,"the narrative reflects a significant level of frustration and helplessness, which are strong indicators of stress. the individual expresses a sense of neglect and lack of support from those around them, which exacerbates their feelings of isolation. specific examples such as the absence of emotional support (""they wont talk to me about my problem""), practical assistance (""they wont lend me a hand to find a job""), and essential resources (""they wont even lend me a car to drive to doctors"") highlight a pervasive sense of abandonment. the repeated dismissal of their concerns with simplistic solutions (""go talk to doctors if im ill and get antidepressants if im depressed"") underscores a lack of understanding and empathy from others, further intensifying their stress. the plea for external help and the mention of possibly finding someone with a similar experience suggest a desperate search for validation and connection, common in individuals experiencing high levels of stress. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with significant emotional and practical challenges, indicative of a stressed state."
"It was one week before the start of my second year of my bachelor’s degree. The first year was wonderful. The second, I was dead because of him… That night, we (my best friend (J), her boyfriend, and L) went to a party at N’s. I don’t really like to drink, so I stayed clear the whole time.",0,"the narrative describes a time leading up to the second year of a bachelor's degree, contrasting it with the positive experience of the first year. despite the mention of feeling ""dead because of him,"" the context of the statement and the events described do not convey a strong sense of ongoing distress or significant stress. the recounting of attending a party and choosing not to drink suggests a level of self-control and decision-making that does not align with typical indicators of stress. there is no detailed elaboration on feelings of anxiety, overwhelming pressure, or other stress-related symptoms. the tone remains relatively neutral and matter-of-fact, lacking the emotional intensity often seen in narratives of individuals experiencing stress."
"I’m onto new studies now, erasing my ancient life, my life related to him. That’s how i’m reconstruct myself for now. I plan to see another therapist, someone who could help me without any conditions. I just need help.

Past few months were pretty rough and I think i’m finally ready to write it down, like if I needed it… I was raped by a “friend” (let’s call him L), the exact day I met my actual boyfriend (let’s call him N), 5 years ago. L wasn’t really a friend of mine, I never appreciated him, but he was closely related to my best friend at the time.",0,"the narrative recounts a traumatic event that occurred five years ago involving sexual assault by an acquaintance. the writer mentions the difficulty of the past few months and the process of coming to terms with the event by writing it down. despite the gravity of the incident, the language used does not convey acute stress symptoms such as panic, overwhelming anxiety, or a sense of immediate threat. instead, the tone appears more reflective and factual. the writer's focus on sharing their story on a supportive platform suggests a coping mechanism rather than a current state of heightened stress. this indicates a level of processing and managing the trauma, which aligns with an absence of immediate stress indicators."
"I remember thinking “What the hell is he doing ?!”. This guy was so tall, so much heavier than me… He grabbed me, was on top of me, told me to “shut my fucking mouth right now”. I tried so hard to move, but I couldn’t… I remember him spitting on his dick, and then he penetrated me, his hand over my mouth. It was so violent, so painful. I can still feel the sweat on his cheek...",1,"the narrative describes a traumatic and violent experience involving physical and sexual assault. the detailed recounting of the event, including the physical overpowering, the explicit language used by the assailant, and the vivid sensory memories such as the feeling of sweat, all indicate significant psychological distress. such intense and invasive experiences are common triggers for acute stress responses and long-term psychological conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the individual's inability to move, the physical pain described, and the emotional impact of the assault are clear indicators of the severe stress and trauma they endured. these aspects of the narrative align with typical symptoms of stress, such as hyperarousal, intrusive memories, and emotional numbness, which can persist long after the incident."
"I do feel like some of my trust has been broken. I know he will always prefer to befriend girls, and I'm not the jealous type, but I just need some help with how to respond to him and how to process this whole scenario.

"Save yourselves, and get a doggo if you can. *Make sure you have the financial stability, and get a dog that’s on-par with your dog experience. It’s important to remember they are a ton of work, large puppies especially, but the distraction is part of what helps. A lot of people get large, active, intelligent dogs as puppies and don’t understand they are a full-time job. For the protection of the dogs, if you’re a first time owner don’t get one that weighs over 30lbs when mature.",0,"the narrative discusses the benefits of getting a dog and offers practical advice for potential dog owners. the tone is informative and balanced, emphasizing the importance of financial stability and matching the dog's needs with the owner's experience level. it highlights the responsibilities involved in dog ownership, particularly with large, active, and intelligent breeds, without displaying signs of emotional distress or urgency. the focus on practical considerations and thoughtful planning indicates a rational and measured approach, which is not typically associated with stress. the narrative's emphasis on the well-being of both the owner and the dog suggests a clear and organized mindset, further supporting the absence of stress indicators."

"However, I've vaguely brought it up before and she said that she wants to also invest one day. My gut feeling is that she's comfortable if we both pay rent and lose money, but might feel weird if one person is benefitting and the other person is not.

"I cannot remember for a fact what age we were and for exactly how long the abuse occurred. But of course I can say for sure there is a 5-year age gap between us, me being younger and female. For some reason the age 8 keeps popping into my head as to how old I was when it happened. I may have been a tiny bit older, but I don't think much younger.

Also, my husband now finds it very very hard to be around my brother when my mom and him and his gf get together for family occasions. I don't find it totally difficult, because he's always been in my life and I've gotten so used to just burying it and forgetting about the abuse.

He tries to stay ""strong"" and act as ""normal"" as possible when we get together so that no one thinks anything is ""wrong"" or asks / puts us on the spot.",0,"the narrative reflects a person discussing complex family dynamics and the varying reactions of family members to past events. the mention of a brother's religious background and uncertainty about his reaction introduces a potential source of tension, but the narrator does not express personal distress about this. instead, they focus on their husband's difficulty being around the brother due to past abuse, highlighting a contrast in coping mechanisms. the narrator's ability to bury and forget about the abuse suggests a level of emotional detachment or resilience. the husband's effort to act normal and avoid drawing attention to their discomfort shows an awareness of social expectations but does not indicate that the narrator is overwhelmed by stress. overall, the narrative emphasizes managing relationships and maintaining appearances rather than conveying a sense of personal stress or anxiety."
"I had been searching for a new place to live since the start of that 6 month notice but I was not capable of finding anywhere to go mainly due to not being able to afford any additional expenses nor was there any source for me to receive the money I required, and since then I have been living outside for the past 5 weeks. During my stay outdoors, I currently work and maintain 3 jobs; one that pays me officially and 'on the books', while the other two serve as jobs that pay me on the side and 'off the books'. This isn't an easy affair either as they all require me to travel to different locations around the area by walking or use of public transportation, which is one of the expenses I am forced to cover on my own and my lack of sleep does not help matters regarding my performance as these jobs. Currently, and for the past 5 weeks, I've been staying at the beach nearby my old home as this is the only area where I am not told to leave by any authority figures, such as on-site workers and police patrolling the area, and also the only area I felt remotely safe at. Recently the weather has gotten pretty bad and this place is no longer the safe haven it once was for me.",1,"the narrative reflects a multitude of stress indicators, primarily stemming from financial instability and housing insecurity. the individual describes an inability to find affordable housing and has been forced to live outdoors for the past five weeks. this situation is exacerbated by the necessity to juggle three jobs, which not only highlights the financial strain but also the physical and mental toll of maintaining such a demanding schedule. the mention of traveling to different locations by walking or public transportation underscores the additional burden of logistical challenges. the lack of sleep is a significant stressor, impacting job performance and overall well-being. the choice of the beach as a temporary refuge indicates a search for safety and stability, which has recently been compromised by deteriorating weather conditions, further contributing to the sense of vulnerability and stress. these elements collectively illustrate a scenario characterized by high stress, driven by a combination of financial hardship, unstable living conditions, and physical exhaustion."

We could be the best template for an 2,5h long Teenager-Drama. ---",1,"the narrative reveals significant emotional turmoil and interpersonal conflict, which are common indicators of stress. the author mentions feelings of anger and jealousy when thinking about their friends, suggesting an ongoing struggle with negative emotions. the complex romantic dynamics described, where one person loves another who does not reciprocate those feelings, adds to the emotional strain. the situation is further complicated by the fact that talking to these friends provides some relief, indicating a reliance on social interactions to manage stress. the comparison to a ""2,5h long teenager-drama"" underscores the intensity and dramatic nature of the emotions involved, highlighting the stressfulness of the situation. overall, the narrative's focus on negative emotions, interpersonal conflict, and the need for emotional support are clear indicators of stress."
"Furthermore, I told him before we got really serious that I have anxiety and depression, and if he can’t handle that then I’ll understand if we end things. But *he* chose to stay with me and help me if I wanted it. Honestly I’m just tired of defending myself to him after this fight. I shouldn’t have to. And he kept threatening to break up; then why don’t you do it?",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the mention of anxiety and depression sets a foundation for understanding the individual's mental health struggles. the tone conveys frustration and fatigue, particularly in the phrase ""im just tired of defending myself."" this suggests emotional exhaustion and a sense of being overwhelmed. the recurring conflict, highlighted by ""after this fight"" and the partner's threats to break up, introduces elements of instability and insecurity in the relationship, which are common stressors. the rhetorical question ""then why dont you do it?"" implies a feeling of helplessness and a lack of control over the situation. these elements collectively point towards a high-stress environment and significant emotional distress."
"Here's the link to my amazon wish list where the two items are: <url> If the link doesn't work, let me know.

Please and thank you!",0,"the narrative indicates a sense of gratitude and hopefulness, which are not typical indicators of stress. the mention of an amazon wish list and the willingness to share it suggests a proactive approach to meeting needs, which can be a sign of effective coping strategies. the statement about the extra $1.25 an hour, while acknowledging the financial challenge of supporting a large family, is framed positively, emphasizing the beneficial impact rather than the burden. this positive framing and focus on solutions rather than problems indicate a mindset that is managing the situation without overwhelming stress. the tone of the narrative is polite and composed, further suggesting a state of relative calm and control."
