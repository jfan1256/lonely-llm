We'd be saving so much money with this new housr...its such an expensive city.... I did some googling in their language and found that it was illegal for them to do that.

"My ex used to shoot back with ""Do you want me to go with you?"" all the time, no matter what it was. I almost wonder if I blocked out him asking me that about our own wedding. I unloaded a terrible memory of this on my current BF today and he took it like a champ, I just could not stop chasing myself in circles over this and knew if I heard any sort of similar phrase I would lose it. I just needed to throw this out in the open, where others who might understand could 'hear' it.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of emotional distress and unresolved trauma from a past relationship. the mention of the ex-partner's repetitive questioning and the potential blocking out of such a memory from their own wedding indicates a deep-seated emotional impact. the narrator's decision to share a painful memory with their current boyfriend, coupled with the acknowledgment of not being able to stop ruminating over it, suggests an ongoing struggle with intrusive thoughts. the fear of hearing a similar phrase and the need to share this experience with others who might understand further highlight feelings of anxiety and the need for validation and support. these elements collectively point towards the presence of stress, as the individual is grappling with past experiences that continue to affect their emotional well-being."
"I haven’t said anything to him yet because I’m not sure how someone would take hearing that their partner has such fluctuations of feelings towards them (especially since he told me he loves me and is somewhat clingy).

Can’t figure out why.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is contemplating how to communicate their fluctuating feelings towards their partner. while the author is experiencing some uncertainty and indecision, the tone of the narrative suggests a thoughtful and reflective approach rather than one marked by significant stress. the person is seeking advice and appears to be planning to address the situation in a measured way, indicating a level of emotional regulation and problem-solving capability. the mention of wanting to get their feelings in order before having a conversation shows an intention to handle the matter responsibly. these elements suggest that the individual is managing their feelings and is not overwhelmed by stress."

"When moving into their tiny house, they would be given a state I.D. with that tiny house's address on it as well as a list of strict rules they have to follow lest they lose some privileges or even be evicted from their house depending on the rules broken. So basically they won't be homeless anymore but ""homed"" which is why the place would be called ""Homed"". Anyway, the homed will have to pay rent for their tiny homes by either getting a job (which is why it is important for them to get a state I.D.) or doing volunteer work around the community (e.g.",0,"the narrative describes a structured living situation for individuals transitioning from homelessness to having a stable home. it outlines the process of receiving a state i.d., adhering to rules, and contributing through work or volunteer activities. the tone is pragmatic and focused on the logistics and benefits of the program. there is no indication of personal distress or emotional turmoil. instead, the narrative emphasizes practical steps and community involvement, which are not typical indicators of stress. the language used is clear and organized, suggesting a thoughtful and solution-oriented mindset."
"More specifically, for example, I live with roommates and I can't remember the last time it has been quiet in the apartment. There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer.",1,"the narrative clearly demonstrates several indicators of stress. the author describes an inability to find quiet in their living environment, which leads to anxiety and sensory overload. the constant noise from roommates is specifically mentioned as a source of frustration and anger, which are common emotional responses to stress. the difficulty in sleeping due to the noise further highlights the negative impact on the author's well-being. additionally, the classroom experience with a hyper and fast-talking professor exacerbates the author's stress, as they find it hard to stay focused and feel overwhelmed by the teacher's loud voice and irrelevant tangents. these examples illustrate how persistent noise and overwhelming auditory stimuli can contribute to heightened stress levels, leading to feelings of anger, frustration, and difficulty concentrating."
Long story short my family in NE Ohio is abusive as hell so I had to leave the state and stay with family down south. It isn't working out and they're sending me packing to Ohio because I guess I'm a financial problem even though I got a job here. I have nowhere I can stay.

Within 5 days he had made the journey to personally escort me and my belongings to his personal prison he had concocted for his next victim - me.. The first week he was sweet, attentive,... almost too kind.. Then one morning it all changed.",0,"the narrative describes an initially charming and seemingly perfect individual who quickly reveals a darker, controlling side. despite the alarming and distressing events recounted, there is an undercurrent of detachment and a focus on recounting facts rather than delving into personal emotional turmoil. the writer uses vivid imagery and specific details to paint a picture of deception and entrapment, yet there is a lack of introspective commentary on their own psychological state. this suggests a level of emotional distance or resilience, which may indicate that the writer is not currently experiencing overwhelming stress. the emphasis is on the actions and characteristics of the other person rather than on the writer's own feelings or reactions, which could be a sign of narrative processing rather than active stress."
I've always hated nail files. Somehow that's a part of this. God. I'm confused by it all.

"Yesterday afternoon, two black males attacked me from behind, took my phone, and shoved me to the ground. The police came and did all the investigation he could and I came to my hotel I'm currently staying at (I'm traveling right now-yes female solo travel can be dangerous lol), slightly scraped and shaken but no major injuries. The police weren't hopeful that they will get to find my phone with all of my not-backed up travel photos but at least I survived the day and I can get a new phone! Money doesn't concern me, I'm just really bugged that I won't have all of my photos from two-week travel.

"PTSD is life changing for the worse. Every day fight. Getting in a fist fight in high school( who did not get into a fight) I'm not talking about bullying, Playing video games, having bad dreams does not cause PTSD.

He's so warm, I'm craving soo bad to be in his arms rn tbh. I don't wanna go to sleep knowing hes not going to be in bed with me.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep emotional dependency and intense longing for physical and emotional comfort from another person. the writer expresses a strong craving to be held and reassured, which is evident in phrases like ""craving soo bad"" and ""terrifies me back into his arms."" the use of strong language and repetition indicates a heightened emotional state and a sense of urgency. the fear of being alone, particularly at night, suggests anxiety and a possible inability to self-soothe without the presence of their partner. these are common indicators of stress, as they reflect an underlying fear of separation and a reliance on another person for emotional stability. the narrative's emotional intensity and preoccupation with the need for comfort highlight a significant level of distress."

"If I go to an interview for example, I'll know that I'm a good candidate, I'll know that if I don't get it there will always be other opportunities and it's no big deal. Yet I still get nervous because it's something that I want, I want that employer to like me. If I go to an interview with no expectations at all, not even wanting the job (I've done this a few times for practice interviewing), it'll turn out great. What are your thoughts on this? Edit: FYI I'm talking mostly about social anxiety, though it has happened that I get anxiety in the most random places like just going upstairs in a building.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is aware of their qualifications and maintains a positive outlook on job opportunities, indicating a balanced perspective. they recognize that not getting a job is not a significant setback, which suggests resilience and a healthy mindset. the nervousness mentioned is tied to a natural desire for approval rather than overwhelming stress. their experience with practice interviews turning out great shows a proactive approach to managing anxiety. although they mention occasional social anxiety and random anxiety in specific situations, these experiences seem to be isolated and not pervasive, suggesting they do not significantly impact their overall well-being. this self-awareness and ability to reflect on their experiences are typical indicators of someone managing their stress effectively."

I felt a real connection with Post Hardcore/ Alternative. During this time I knew of Anxiety, but I didn't know OF it.

Not sure the best way to describe it but for the last week and a half I have had to be social and around people every day except for a couple of hours each evening and it is KILLING ME.

I didn't think any less of him, and I told him that. I can understand him being embarrassed though. Anyway, last night I had been joking about looking at his browser history after seeing a recently viewed tab for porn.

The surgery was costly but necessary, however we are now having difficulty paying our bills. We have reached out to family and friends for support and are now searching for any help we can get. Thank you for taking the time to hear our story.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of stress through several key elements. firstly, the individual describes a sudden and urgent health crisis with their puppy, which inherently brings about significant emotional distress and anxiety. the mention of the girlfriend being out of the country adds a layer of isolation and responsibility, increasing the pressure on the narrator. the financial strain caused by the costly surgery is another critical factor, as difficulty in paying bills and the need to seek help from family and friends are common stressors. the overall tone of the narrative conveys a sense of urgency, worry, and helplessness, all of which are strong indicators of stress."
"To help us transition smoothly, please place all Thanksgiving-related anxieties in this thread. Any feedback is welcome - please reply directly to the sticky comment with your thoughts. If all goes well, we hope to expand this idea to the December holiday season and beyond. Happy Thanksgiving in advance from the /r/Anxiety Mod Team! <3",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and organized approach to managing potential holiday-related stress, which suggests a sense of control and preparedness rather than current stress. the invitation for feedback and open communication indicates a supportive community environment, which is typically associated with lower stress levels. the tone is positive and forward-looking, as evidenced by the wish for a happy thanksgiving and the heart emoji, which further implies a state of calm and optimism. the structured plan to address anxieties collectively also shows an intention to mitigate future stress, rather than dealing with immediate, overwhelming stressors. overall, the narrative exemplifies characteristics of an individual or group that is focused on creating a stress-free experience through thoughtful planning and community support."
"###Hello everyone!, We hope you've begun defrosting your turkeys in preparation for a delicious meal. As the holiday season begins to ramp up, we've decided to try a new approach to handling the influx of Thanksgiving-related posts we normally receive every year. We're excited to be launching a Thanksgiving MegaThread, a single post for users to share their turkey-day anxieties and support others. Our goal in this trial is two-fold:",0,"the narrative reflects an organized and proactive approach to managing a common seasonal event, which is indicative of a structured and composed mindset. the language used is positive and inclusive, such as ""excited,"" ""hope,"" and ""support others,"" which suggests a sense of community and optimism. the announcement of a new strategy to handle thanksgiving-related posts demonstrates foresight and planning, traits that are typically associated with a non-stressed state. the mention of sharing anxieties is framed within a supportive context, further emphasizing a solution-oriented attitude rather than an expression of personal stress. overall, the tone and content suggest a calm and collected demeanor, focused on providing assistance and fostering a positive environment."
"Wondering if anyone has this same problem and if anyone has found a way of overcoming it. Regardless of who messages me (family, friends, strangers) I avoid opening the message (text message, email, social media message, calls, voicemails) and avoid replying until hours later or even the next day. I don’t know why I do this, but I feel like it takes so much of my energy to open the message and reply and it’s almost like I don’t want to have a continuous conversation with anyone. It’s very bad for trying to maintain healthy relationships. Does anyone else suffer with this from anxiety?",1,"the narrative highlights a pattern of behavior often associated with stress and anxiety. the individual describes a significant avoidance of communication, regardless of the sender, which suggests a pervasive issue rather than an isolated incident. this avoidance extends to multiple forms of communication, including text messages, emails, social media messages, calls, and voicemails, indicating a broad impact on their daily life. the person acknowledges the negative effect this has on their relationships, recognizing it as detrimental to maintaining healthy connections. the use of phrases like ""takes so much of my energy"" and ""almost like i don't want to have a continuous conversation"" points to an underlying sense of overwhelm and exhaustion, which are common symptoms of stress. the narrative concludes with a direct question about suffering from anxiety, further linking their behavior to stress-related experiences. these elements collectively illustrate a pattern of stress and avoidance behavior, which is why the narrative is indicative of an individual experiencing stress."
Any advice is welcome. I'll be checking in and replying to comments as much as I can but I have to be discreet so I may not be able to answer for a while. Thank you in advanced. Tldr: I was ready to move out then my car broke down and he is now fixing it. He doesn't know I'm leaving as soon as he's done and I feel terrible about it because he's actually being nice for a change and is trying to stay sober.,1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, which can be inferred from the writer's emotional state and circumstances. the person expresses a need for advice and mentions the necessity to be discreet, suggesting a sense of urgency and secrecy. the situation involves a broken-down car, a significant stressor, especially when it disrupts important plans like moving out. the writer's conflicting emotions about leaving someone who is now being nice and trying to stay sober add to the psychological burden. this internal conflict and guilt about leaving despite the person's efforts to improve indicate a complex emotional struggle. the need to check in and reply to comments as much as possible, despite the need for discretion, also points to a heightened state of anxiety and the need for external support. these elements collectively highlight a narrative filled with stress-related indicators."
"I stuck it out because I didn't have the means to leave and I had a hard time accepting it was abuse. I tried to change my behaviour, but nothing was ever good enough. It was a typical narcissistic and empath relationship. I slowly realized even if I was wrong, it didn't warrant this treatment. Cue months of gaslighting that I was suffering from ppd (this may be somewhat true, but didn't dismiss the fact that he was also abusive.)",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through the description of an abusive relationship and the internal conflict experienced by the author. the mention of feeling trapped due to a lack of means to leave and the difficulty in accepting the situation as abuse highlights a state of helplessness and emotional turmoil. the author's attempt to change their behavior, only to find it perpetually inadequate, suggests a constant state of anxiety and self-doubt. the term ""narcissistic and empath relationship"" implies a dynamic where one partner manipulates and the other absorbs the emotional impact, which is a known stress-inducing interaction. the realization that mistreatment was unwarranted, despite personal faults, indicates a gradual awakening to the abuse, which can be a distressing and confusing process. the reference to gaslighting and the potential misdiagnosis of postpartum depression further emphasizes the psychological manipulation and the additional layer of stress from questioning one's mental state. these elements collectively point to a narrative deeply embedded in stress, marked by emotional struggle, manipulation, and a journey towards self-awareness amidst abuse."
I don’t get paid again until 9/1/18. This is the only low cost apartment near my school. What can I do? I’m desperately in need help and it has to be paid. Very comfortable and willing to show proof of security deposit from the leasing portal.,1,"the narrative reflects significant stress due to financial insecurity and housing instability. the individual is concerned about an imminent payment deadline for their apartment, which is essential for their proximity to school. phrases like ""desperately in need help"" and ""it has to be paid"" indicate a high level of urgency and anxiety. the mention of willingness to show proof of the security deposit further underscores the desperation and the need to find a solution quickly. such financial and housing pressures are common stressors that can lead to significant emotional distress, impacting overall mental well-being."
"I have reduced my drinking a ton since i started it and by the second week I could already feel a major improvement in my anxiety and mental clarity, but it may have been largely due to my reduction in alcohol. In the past three days I have felt myself beginning to spiral and today I am feeling very very dark, very disconnected. I am such a low dosage I am wondering if maybe it's just not working and what I thought was it working was actually just reducing the alcohol intake? Because now all I want to do is crawl into bed.. or drink.. fantasizing about self harm. I also feel like I'm just obsessed with feeling bad and I am doing this to myself.",1,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced some improvement in their anxiety and mental clarity due to a reduction in alcohol consumption. however, they have recently noticed a decline in their mental state, feeling dark and disconnected. the mention of feeling like they are spiraling and fantasizing about self-harm are significant indicators of stress. the individual is questioning the effectiveness of their current treatment and expressing feelings of hopelessness and self-blame. these thoughts and feelings are typical indicators of stress and possibly depression, highlighting a struggle with maintaining mental health improvements and dealing with negative emotions."
"I never thought I'd actually be homeless without the drugs. It's kind of like regular camping, except instead of raccoons and bears you gotta look out for tweakers, creeps, and J-cats... I plan on starting a work program soon, I've already signed up with probation, and I'm starting to be my own friend again. Laughing has helped too. Endorphins and oxytocin are getting me high as FUCK.",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and proactive mindset, despite the challenging circumstances. the individual acknowledges their current situation without succumbing to despair. they compare their experience to camping, which suggests a level of acceptance and resilience. the mention of starting a work program and signing up with probation indicates a forward-looking attitude and a desire to improve their situation. the reference to becoming their own friend again and the benefits of laughter highlights self-care and the use of healthy coping mechanisms. the mention of endorphins and oxytocin suggests that they are finding natural ways to boost their mood, which is a positive sign of mental well-being. overall, the narrative shows signs of adaptability, optimism, and effective stress management."
"We talked for almost 2 hours that night and she insisted that she didn't want to end things, just wanted to slow it down for a while until she was comfortable. She told me she had just gotten out a relationship before we met, and didn't intend to have such strong feelings for me and now she is just scared. I actually ended up really liking her which has been rare for me lately, so this is something i would like to hold on to if at all salvageable. The problem is we barely text (once a week or so), and have not hung out since that party. Is this a case of 'Just not that into you' so she's just trying to be nice?",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing uncertainty and confusion about a budding relationship. while there are elements of concern and introspection, such as questioning the other person's intentions and the infrequency of communication, these do not necessarily indicate stress. instead, the narrative reflects a thoughtful and measured approach to understanding the dynamics at play. the writer acknowledges the other person's feelings and circumstances, which shows empathy and patience rather than stress. the overall tone is one of curiosity and a desire for clarity rather than anxiety or distress."
"It certainly seemed like we were both really feeling it, and ended up sleeping together after the second date (realize this is a little soon). After the first few dates we decided to host a party together around the holidays and for some reason after this her interest level dropped severely. Told me it was moving too quickly and she was scared that it was headed toward something she wasn't ready for. I backed off after this, eventually called her a few weeks later (because communication between us had severely slowed down). I attempted to end what we were doing because i could feel she wasn't interested anymore.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events in a relationship where the initial excitement and connection gradually diminish. the individual recounts the progression from an early intimate encounter to hosting a party together, followed by a noticeable decline in the other person's interest. the narrator reflects on the partner's concerns about the relationship moving too quickly and ultimately decides to step back when communication slows down. despite the disappointment and the decision to end things, the narrative lacks overt expressions of anxiety, overwhelming emotions, or signs of significant distress. instead, it presents a logical and measured response to the situation, demonstrating an understanding of the partner's perspective and a willingness to respect their feelings. this approach suggests a level of emotional regulation and acceptance that is not typically associated with stress."
"My (now ex) boyfriend (19M) broke up with me (20F) 4 days ago. We would have been together for 6 months this Sunday. However, the way in which he did it leaves me wondering if he left the door open or not. The reason why he broke up with me is that this coming semester, he will be working/in class for 12 hours a day and he doesn’t want to put me through that, since he won’t have enough time to give me. He then said that he didn’t think this would be the last time we spoke, and that we would somehow find our way back into each other’s lives eventually.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and contemplation rather than acute stress. the individual is reflecting on a recent breakup and trying to make sense of the situation. while there is a natural emotional response to the end of a relationship, the focus is on understanding the ex-boyfriend's reasons and the potential for future reconnection. the language used is more analytical and inquisitive rather than distressed or overwhelmed. phrases like ""leaves me wondering"" and ""trying to make sense"" indicate a cognitive processing of events rather than an immediate stress reaction. the mention of the ex-boyfriend's busy schedule and the thoughtful consideration of time constraints also suggest a rational approach to the situation. overall, the narrative lacks indicators of significant distress, such as pervasive anxiety, hopelessness, or a sense of being overwhelmed, which are common markers of stress."
"I can't ask my family because they don't have the kind of money to help me. If anyone can help me even just a little bit, I would be ridiculously grateful. I just can't even express what this has done to us. Yes, the bills are paid, but now we're so anxious that we barely leave the house due to panic attacks. I've done things like ubereats but $15 here and there isn't even making a dent in what I need.",1,"the narrative reflects significant financial distress and emotional turmoil. the individual expresses a sense of helplessness and desperation, highlighting their inability to seek financial support from their family. the plea for any amount of help, coupled with the phrase ""ridiculously grateful,"" underscores the depth of their need and the emotional weight they are carrying. the mention of anxiety and panic attacks indicates a high level of psychological stress, further exacerbated by the financial strain. the reference to attempting to earn money through ubereats, yet acknowledging that the small earnings are insufficient, emphasizes the ongoing struggle and the sense of being overwhelmed. these elements are typical indicators of stress, as they reveal both the external pressures of financial instability and the internal emotional responses of anxiety and panic."
"I’d appreciate any and all tips or suggestions about how I can best support her. My heart hurts knowing we won’t be dating anyone soon, but I love her so much I want to give her time and space to heal. In the meantime, I’ll work on being the best version of myself. TL:DR My girlfriend and I broke up due to a job that puts us 5 hours away.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and proactive thinking rather than stress. the author expresses a desire to support their ex-girlfriend and acknowledges the emotional pain of the breakup, yet they focus on self-improvement and providing space for healing. the use of words like ""appreciate,"" ""love,"" and ""support"" indicates a positive and constructive mindset. rather than dwelling on negative emotions or displaying signs of overwhelming distress, the author demonstrates a balanced approach to coping with the situation. this indicates a healthy emotional response, showing resilience and a forward-looking perspective, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"When I ask him why he’s done this he says “Shut the fuck up.” He also “talks down” to me in bed, calling me slut, pig, and stupid. I am NOT into this and I never told him I was. When I am giving him fellatio he pushes my head down even when I am resisting and I choke. He has also pulled my hair, hit me and punched me.",1,"the narrative describes a series of abusive behaviors from a partner, including verbal degradation and physical aggression, which are clear indicators of a highly stressful and potentially traumatic situation. the use of derogatory language such as ""slut,"" ""pig,"" and ""stupid,"" along with non-consensual acts during intimate moments, highlights a lack of respect and emotional safety in the relationship. the physical actions of pushing the narrator's head down during fellatio, pulling hair, hitting, and punching are not only abusive but also create a constant environment of fear and helplessness. these experiences are typical indicators of severe stress as they can lead to chronic anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the power imbalance and the lack of consent in these interactions further exacerbate the narrator's stress, making it difficult for them to feel secure or valued in their relationship."
"I texted him good morning. Then begun the message about how I would love to, but I can't because marriage is something I want now. Before I got the chance to send that text, he sent another one. He had come to the conclusion that he wanted to marry me. Genuinely.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is engaging in a conversation about a significant relationship milestone, specifically marriage. the tone of the narrative suggests a positive and hopeful interaction. the mention of texting ""good morning"" indicates a routine and calm start to the day, which is often associated with a stable emotional state. the anticipation of discussing marriage and the subsequent revelation that the other person also wants to marry the narrator points to a resolution of potential uncertainty, leading to feelings of reassurance and happiness. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing a moment of emotional stability and contentment rather than stress. the absence of language indicating anxiety, worry, or distress further supports this interpretation."
"i know this is a common problem that many people have but i dont know what to do. i dont sleep at all on sunday nights and it fucks up my whole week. im scared of the sadness i will feel as soon as i wake up, im scared of having to repeat the same day over and over until friday, im scared of waking up in a panic attack, im scared of having a long complex dream and then waking up not remembering it or not liking it. the stupidest things freak me out and im so sad and tired. i brought this up to my therapist towards the end of my session but she didnt really have an answer, and i didnt bring it up the next week.",1,"the narrative reflects significant signs of stress through the individual's detailed description of their sleep disturbances and associated fears. the person expresses anxiety about the sadness and panic they anticipate upon waking, which suggests a heightened state of emotional distress. the repetitive nature of their worries, such as the dread of facing the same day repeatedly until friday, indicates a persistent and overwhelming sense of dread. their mention of being ""scared"" multiple times underscores a pervasive anxiety that affects their sleep and overall mental state. the frustration with their therapist's lack of a solution and the reluctance to revisit the topic further highlights feelings of helplessness and isolation. these elements collectively point to a substantial level of stress impacting their daily life and mental well-being."
"Please, I'm NOT looking for any handouts. That's the last thing in the world I need. I WANT to pay back every penny that's loaned to me. I just feel like this is too big of a loan to ask on /r/borrow, and I'm stuck in such a rut. I've found a few nice cars around here that I feel would fit the bill in the $2500 price range, and then tax, tag and title, and maybe a couple months of insurance payment.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of responsibility and determination to repay any loan taken, which suggests a level-headed and practical approach to financial difficulties. the individual expresses clear goals and a well-thought-out plan for managing their expenses, such as considering the cost of a car and associated fees. their focus on self-sufficiency and refusal of handouts indicates a proactive mindset rather than one overwhelmed by stress. overall, the narrative lacks signs of desperation or emotional turmoil, which are often associated with stress, and instead shows a composed and strategic attitude towards resolving their financial situation."
"Okay this is driving totally insane and I can't function normally because of it, I have had intrusive thoughts basically for as long as I can remember, though now they are pushing me closer and closer to insanity. I am only focusing on one disturbing thought now which I really only need serious and helpful answers for. To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room.",1,"the narrative contains several indicators of stress. the author describes an inability to function normally and mentions experiencing intrusive thoughts for a prolonged period, which are classic signs of stress and anxiety. the use of phrases like ""driving totally insane"" and ""pushing me closer and closer to insanity"" further highlight the severe impact these thoughts are having on their mental state. the specific incident involving confusion about waking up in an unexpected place adds to the distress, as it suggests a lack of control and clarity, which can exacerbate feelings of stress. the author’s plea for ""serious and helpful answers"" indicates a desperate need for resolution and support, underscoring the significant emotional turmoil they are experiencing. these elements collectively point to a high level of stress and anxiety in the narrative."
I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that posts on here. I just found this subreddit yesterday and reading all of your guys' posts have made me feel so much less alone. Knowing that other people understand what I'm going through for some reason has helped me tremendously. Particularly a post that someone made about feeling like their trauma isnt real and like convincing yourself that it didnt happen. I have felt like I'm crazy for years because I was in such deep denial about what happened to me.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of relief and gratitude rather than stress. the individual expresses appreciation for the community and indicates that reading others' posts has provided significant emotional support. the mention of feeling less alone and the acknowledgment that others understand their experience suggest a positive shift in their emotional state. while the person does reference past feelings of denial and questioning their trauma, the overall tone is one of validation and connection. this sense of belonging and understanding from others typically alleviates stress, indicating a movement towards emotional well-being rather than a current state of stress."
"How can I be a good boyfriend in this situation? I don't think she should “give up having friends” and I think she should hold on to the ones who suffer from similar issues and understand (and some of them are also great, kind people that she should hold on to regardless). I think spending time with other people than me is good for her, but she is so afraid of ruining things for others. TL;DR: Girlfriend has anxiety attacks and cancels plans with friends, not all friends are very understanding. I know how to comfort her when she's feeling down, but how do I otherwise support and advise her in the best possible way?",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is concerned about their girlfriend's well-being and is seeking advice on how to be supportive. it shows empathy and understanding towards the girlfriend's struggles with anxiety, highlighting a desire to encourage her to maintain friendships and engage with others. the writer acknowledges the importance of social support and expresses a willingness to comfort her, indicating a thoughtful and considerate approach. there is no evident distress or overwhelming worry in the narrative; rather, it is characterized by a proactive and caring attitude, which are not typical indicators of stress."
"I stopped eating and stopped sleeping... I eventually ended up in A&E after telling my family I intended to kill my self, I'd already been self harming and pulling out my hair from the stress. I lost a stone and a half in weight in a month. I was given sleeping pills as I had not had the rest to let my brain consider recovery, and I was given lorazepam for the holidays so I could get out of the house to have Christmas with the family. I now only use lorazepam for panic attacks I have at work or situations I cannot leave when I panic , like catching a plane.",1,"the narrative describes severe physical and emotional symptoms that are clear indicators of significant stress. the individual mentions stopping eating and sleeping, which are common physiological responses to intense stress. the fact that they ended up in a&e after expressing suicidal intentions and engaging in self-harming behaviors such as pulling out their hair highlights a critical level of distress. the substantial weight loss over a short period is another sign of extreme stress affecting their physical health. the use of sleeping pills and lorazepam indicates that medical intervention was necessary to manage their symptoms, and the ongoing use of lorazepam for panic attacks at work or in unavoidable situations suggests that the individual continues to experience stress-related issues. these aspects collectively point to a narrative typical of someone under significant stress."
"I’m so tired of people evaluating me visually and telling me “I look fine” when 3 TBIs and complex PTSD are, by nature, invisible. I feel so alone in this, and judged because my resilience activities, running and lifting, make me appear perfectly normal. I’m desperate to overcome these issues, especially given my profession and the need to operate in crowded conditions. Army docs dismiss my problems because I look capable and am a high-achiever despite it all, even questioning whether the incident resulting in my PH “actually happened”. I need someone to believe me.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the author's expressed frustration and feelings of isolation. the mention of traumatic brain injuries (tbis) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) highlights severe underlying issues that are not outwardly visible, leading to a sense of being misunderstood and dismissed by others, including medical professionals. the author's engagement in resilience activities such as running and lifting, which create a misleading appearance of normalcy, exacerbates their sense of being unfairly judged. the desperation to overcome these challenges, particularly in a demanding profession that requires functioning in crowded environments, underscores the immense pressure they feel. the dismissive attitude of army doctors and the questioning of the incident causing their purple heart (ph) further contribute to their stress, amplifying feelings of invalidation and the need for someone to acknowledge and believe their struggles. these elements collectively point to a high level of psychological distress."
"Btw, I am only an exec.... I am afraid to have a gap in my CV, but for once in my life I want not to worry for a bit.

What did you do to overcome it?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of contemplation and a desire for balance rather than immediate distress. the individual expresses concern about having a gap in their cv, which is a common worry but does not necessarily indicate high stress. the mention of wanting ""not to worry for a bit"" suggests a proactive approach to managing potential stress, showing an awareness and a plan to address it. the decision to apply for jobs without rushing indicates a level-headed strategy rather than panic or urgency. additionally, reaching out to someone else for advice on similar experiences demonstrates a healthy coping mechanism and a search for social support. these elements collectively suggest a thoughtful and measured approach to their situation, which are not typical indicators of high stress."
"I asked the other day if they've set a date. He laughed in my face and said 'no' as if it were the most ridiculous thing he's ever heard. He comes home late, and showers immediately. Then, he showers every morning before he leaves. He doesn't talk to my mum and I, at all, and he's cagey and secretive about everything, to the point of hostility towards my sister.",1,"the narrative describes a situation characterized by significant interpersonal tension and secrecy, which are common indicators of stress. the individual recounts being laughed at dismissively when asking about a date, which suggests feelings of disrespect and invalidation. the described behavior of coming home late, showering immediately, and again in the morning, points to potential anxiety or attempts to hide something, contributing to an atmosphere of mistrust. the lack of communication and hostility towards family members, including the avoidance of interactions with the mother and open hostility towards the sister, are indicative of strained relationships and emotional distress. these behaviors collectively suggest that the person is experiencing a high level of stress, likely stemming from unresolved conflicts and a lack of open, supportive communication within the family."
"I can't support their relationship on any level. To make it clear, neither does my mother. She only allows him to remain here because he'd be homeless and be forced to move hours away to a place with almost no transport and he'd take my sister with him (he did it before. It culminated in the allegations of cheating and the choking), and that's the last thing we want. Better the devil you know and your enemies close or something.",0,"the narrative describes a complex and tense family situation, but it is presented in a manner that suggests the author is managing their emotions and the circumstances. the use of logical reasoning and a strategic approach to dealing with the problematic individual (keeping him close to avoid worse outcomes) indicates a level of control and rational thinking. the mention of past incidents like cheating and choking is factual and lacks emotional outbursts or signs of overwhelming distress. the author appears to be coping with the situation by focusing on practical solutions and the greater good for their family, which are not typical indicators of stress. instead, these aspects reflect a pragmatic and composed mindset, suggesting resilience and effective problem-solving abilities."
"It was two months ago and since then, we've been both trying to make some efforts to make our relationship great again (sorry for the reference, but I confess the phrase is catchy), but she's still not sure and is still often distant... Sometimes she says I love You, and sometimes she's not sure again... I don't really know what it means to not know what one feels for another. I guess it's a thing, and I try to accept that, but I don't know how to react, what to do, what to think... I was so happy with her, I just feel overwhelmingly sad and can't help ask myself what a did wrong, what I should do, where this is going.",1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and uncertainty, which are key indicators of stress. the individual describes ongoing efforts to mend a relationship that seems unstable, with fluctuating expressions of affection from their partner. the inconsistency in the partner's feelings contributes to the individual's confusion and distress. the repeated questioning of their own actions and the future of the relationship suggests a preoccupation with self-doubt and a lack of control over the situation. the mention of feeling ""overwhelmingly sad"" and the inability to stop questioning themselves are classic signs of emotional stress. the overall tone conveys a sense of helplessness and a deep yearning for resolution, which are typical in stressed individuals dealing with complex interpersonal issues."
"I've never been medically diagnosed with anxiety, and I know that I would need to see a professional to officially determine if I really had anxiety, but sometimes I relate to symptoms of anxiety I see online and wonder if I should be concerned. Some things that have led me to think I may have anxiety: I've been performing on stages for all of my life, but I still find my heart racing and knees weak every time I'm on stage. One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators typically associated with stress. the individual describes experiencing physical symptoms such as a racing heart and weak knees during performances, which are common physiological responses to stress and anxiety. despite having a long history of performing, these symptoms persist, suggesting a consistent underlying stress response. the mention of needing to remove oneself from a situation after a performance mistake indicates a significant emotional reaction to perceived failure, another hallmark of stress. the person also expresses uncertainty about their mental health status and relates to anxiety symptoms found online, highlighting a level of self-awareness and concern that can be indicative of stress. the overall tone of the narrative, marked by self-doubt and physical symptoms, aligns with experiences often reported by those under stress."
"I keep it together at work and hear I'm doing great, but I'm always on the edge of falling apart. I've been through tough adjustments before which always suck, but this is hitting me differently, maybe because it's high level/can't and don't want to quit. (But kinda want to win the lotto so I could quit). I want to get through this transition and get good at this job, bit I can't do survival mode much longer. Working too much but idk how to stop.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, such as the individual's constant feeling of being on the edge of falling apart despite receiving positive feedback at work. this internal conflict between external validation and personal turmoil is a classic sign of stress. the mention of tough adjustments and the unique difficulty of the current situation suggests a significant emotional burden. the desire to win the lottery to escape the job indicates a strong wish to avoid the current stressors. the acknowledgment of survival mode and the struggle to manage excessive work hours further highlight the chronic stress the individual is experiencing. these elements collectively illustrate a state of ongoing stress and the individual's difficulty in coping with it."
Last night one firmed and I were texting about something unrelated and B was brought up. I basically told her that I have distanced myself from B because of XYZ. She said she understands but B has been really nice lately and has been supportive of her pregnancy and has bought the baby tons of stuff... I don’t know why but I feel weird about that conversation. I even told her that I refrained from telling anyone for so long bc I don’t want anyone to view her differently.,0,"the narrative reflects a conversation between friends where one individual discusses their feelings about another person, referred to as b. despite the underlying tension regarding the distancing from b, the overall tone of the narrative lacks indicators of significant stress. the individual expresses some discomfort and confusion about the conversation but does not exhibit symptoms typically associated with high stress, such as anxiety, overwhelming worry, or emotional distress. the mention of distancing and the protective instinct to not alter others' perceptions of b suggests some level of introspection and concern, but it is articulated in a relatively calm and composed manner. the focus on b's supportive behavior and the friend's understanding response further contributes to a sense of resolution and balance, rather than heightened stress."
"My sister is an alcoholic, which is something that seems to run in the family. Everytime my mother invites her over to spend the night, she has to hide all her beer and wine in a futile attempt to keep my sister from drinking it all. However, my sister always sneaks alcohol into the house anyway, and is drunk by nightfall. Then the arguments start. Usually they start over something like dinner not being done soon enough, or because my mother found the boxed wine my sister smuggled in, or because my mother simply said something that stuck in my sister's craw.",0,"the narrative describes a challenging family dynamic involving an alcoholic sister, but the tone and content suggest a level of acceptance and routine in dealing with the situation. while the circumstances are certainly difficult, the writer details the events with a sense of resignation rather than acute distress. phrases like ""everytime my mother invites her over"" and ""my sister always sneaks alcohol"" indicate a pattern that the family has become accustomed to managing. the arguments, though disruptive, are depicted as predictable and centered around specific triggers. the absence of language that conveys overwhelming anxiety or despair points to a situation that, though stressful, is handled with a degree of normalcy and expectation. this suggests that the writer is coping with the situation in a manner that doesn't reflect immediate or severe stress."
"It has been some time since I posted, but with Fall setting in my anxiety is really getting to me. The cold frightens me, I don't think my partner can survive the weather to come. I used to love Fall, I still do in some ways, but these past couple years really puts into perspective how dangerous it can be. The dread that Winter will be here soon with such instability. But I need the rain; I need the colder temperatures, because I need to have the best mushroom season I have ever had.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author explicitly mentions experiencing anxiety, which is a direct symptom of stress. the cold weather and the fear for their partner's well-being are causing significant distress, indicating a preoccupation with potential negative outcomes. the shift in their perception of fall, from a season they loved to one that now brings dread, highlights a change in their emotional state likely driven by stress. the mention of instability and the looming threat of winter exacerbate their anxiety, showing how external environmental factors are contributing to their stress levels. even though they acknowledge a need for rain and colder temperatures for a good mushroom season, this positive aspect is overshadowed by their overwhelming concerns and fear, illustrating a complex interplay of stressors that dominate their thoughts."
"How...do I do that? How much/how little should I say? How can I face my class and my RAs again now that they know I'm a nutcase? TLDR: Had a meltdown in trauma class, and I'm afraid it'll happen again. How do I tell my professor and prepare for the almost inevitable hellscape that is my inability to keep my shit together?",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress, such as the repetitive questioning and self-doubt seen in ""how...do i do that?"" and ""how much/how little should i say?"" these questions reflect a heightened level of anxiety and uncertainty. the writer's use of the term ""nutcase"" to describe themselves suggests a negative self-perception and internalized stigma, which are common in individuals experiencing stress. the reference to a ""meltdown in trauma class"" indicates a specific, distressing event that has heightened their anxiety about future occurrences. the fear of facing their class and resident assistants (ras) again demonstrates social anxiety and a concern about judgment from peers. the phrase ""almost inevitable hellscape"" conveys a sense of dread and hopelessness about managing their emotional state. overall, the narrative is characterized by a pervasive sense of anxiety, self-criticism, and fear of recurrence, all of which are strong indicators of stress."
Hi everyone. For a few months now I haven't been able to get this off my mind. My abuser was my cousin who is 5-7 years older than me(24F). He is very close to my brother and father. His dad is a wonderful person and my favorite uncle.,0,"the narrative describes a difficult and potentially traumatic situation involving an abuser who is a family member, yet it is presented in a relatively detached and factual manner. the writer mentions the relationship dynamics within the family, including the positive view of the abuser's father, but does not delve into emotional expressions or signs of distress. the absence of explicit emotional language, such as feelings of fear, anxiety, or sadness, suggests a level of emotional detachment or coping that is not indicative of acute stress. instead, the focus is on the factual recounting of relationships and events without delving into the psychological impact or emotional turmoil that might be expected in a narrative from someone experiencing significant stress."
"By the fourth infusion, I was able to sleep through the night, and only got a mild feeling of anxiety when talking or thinking about it. Today, while leaving my psychologist's office, I saw someone get hit by a car. It was not pretty. He died. Right as I'm starting to move past one, another happens.",1,"the narrative reflects a clear indication of stress through several elements. initially, the individual mentions a sense of relief from anxiety due to the fourth infusion, suggesting a prior struggle with stress or anxiety. however, this relief is overshadowed by a traumatic event witnessed after leaving the psychologist's office. the description of seeing someone get hit by a car and subsequently dying is a significant traumatic experience. the phrase ""it was not pretty"" implies a graphic and disturbing scene, which can be highly distressing. the concluding statement, ""right as i am starting to move past one, another happens,"" highlights a sense of being overwhelmed and a lack of respite from distressing events. these elements collectively point towards ongoing stress and difficulty in coping with traumatic experiences."
"Best friend knows I have anxiety and I am always asking her if she's mad at me. Well, yesterday she asked if I wanted to go to the beach next weekend, I said yes, and then today I told her I couldn't because I was supposed to watch my sister's kids. She wants to know why I don't take them with us. It's a two hour drive, and I really just don't want to go. But then she says that I always say no when she asks me to go somewhere with her.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual interacts with a friend and navigates social commitments. while the person mentions having anxiety, the overall tone and content of the narrative suggest a level of normalcy in dealing with everyday social dilemmas. the individual's concerns about changing plans and their friend's reaction are common and not necessarily indicative of high stress levels. the dialogue about not wanting to take the kids on a long drive and the friend's comment about always saying no are typical of regular social interactions and do not exhibit significant signs of distress or overwhelming anxiety. this indicates that the person is managing their anxiety in a relatively stable manner and the narrative lacks the urgency or heightened emotional responses often associated with stress."
"Dad is utterly distraught, he has never laid a finger on us. He's not even allowed to have at his house overnight, and all visitations are supervised. I did not stay at my dads house overnight until I was 16, and that was because my mom did something horrible, and I was foced to flee the house. &nbsp; I had struggled making friends because of my abuse at home and unruly behavior at school.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, primarily rooted in family dynamics and personal experiences. the description of the father's emotional state as ""utterly distraught"" suggests a significant emotional burden within the family. the constraints on the father's ability to have his children overnight and the need for supervised visitations indicate a strained and possibly contentious family situation, contributing to an environment of instability and stress. the narrator's own experiences of fleeing the house due to their mother's actions and the struggle to make friends due to abuse at home and unruly behavior at school further underscore the pervasive stress. these elements collectively highlight a background of emotional turmoil, family conflict, and social difficulties, all of which are strong indicators of a high-stress environment."
* I refused to fold his underwear. Just a couple smacks this time. (age 9) * I couldn't convince my dad to sign adoption papers so stepdad could adopt me. Late nights with mom ensue and I get special attention from stepdad for a week or two (age 7 or 8),0,"the narrative reflects experiences that might be challenging, but the tone and content do not necessarily indicate current stress. the mention of refusing to fold underwear and receiving smacks, while potentially indicative of past discipline, does not convey an ongoing sense of distress. similarly, the inability to convince the dad to sign adoption papers and the subsequent special attention from the stepdad, while significant events, are described in a matter-of-fact manner without emotional elaboration. the narrative lacks expressions of anxiety, worry, or other emotional cues that typically accompany descriptions of stress. overall, the recounting of events appears detached and factual, suggesting a level of emotional processing or distance from the experiences described."
"Sister and I were watching the three VHS tapes we own on repeat because we literally don't have anything else. (I know, sorry for the whining. I feel very lucky that we even had a TV to share.) I should mention that this was to bully us as prior to this Dad sees me literally falling apart, starts playing video games with me more often. We get a PS2 to share and keep at his house (Jak and Daxter Bundle, so it was new and expensive) with what little money he has.",0,"the narrative describes a scenario where the individual and their sister are repeatedly watching the same vhs tapes due to a lack of other entertainment options. despite this, the author expresses gratitude for having a tv to share. the mention of their father noticing the author's distress and subsequently engaging in video games with them, eventually buying a ps2, suggests a supportive family environment. this context indicates that while there may be some challenging circumstances, the presence of positive interactions and acts of care from the father mitigates significant stress. the narrative highlights resilience and appreciation rather than overwhelming stress, suggesting that the individual is managing their situation well with the help of family support."
"Do you huddle up in the corner of some obscure building that's out of the way? Under a pine tree that's thick enough to prevent any outsiders knowing you're there? Those are kind of the best ideas I have... but I really don't know and I would greatly appreciate any advice. I don't want to give too many details but I live in a city of just over 100,000 people. I'm already on food and medical assistance.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of anxiety and stress through its content and tone. the individual describes seeking obscure and hidden places to stay, which indicates a heightened sense of vulnerability and the need for safety and seclusion. the mention of already being on food and medical assistance highlights financial and possibly health-related stressors. the request for advice and the uncertainty expressed suggest feelings of helplessness and desperation. these elements collectively point towards significant stress, as the person is preoccupied with finding secure and hidden locations, indicative of an underlying fear or threat."
"I'm an adult with a mental illness, went through a messy breakup with an unhealthy ex that I thought was the one and was in a codependant relationship with, I felt like I was letting him use my body by the end of it. I have ended up basically non functioning, isolated, living on couch eating take away once a day for the last 10 months. Started staying at my parents intermittently in November, having a rough time processing stuff with my ex. Cue four days of remembering incidents of inappropriate sexual touching from my father when I was a child. Non stop.",1,"the narrative describes a series of distressing and traumatic experiences, including a mental illness, a painful breakup from a codependent relationship, and a period of severe functional decline and isolation. the individual expresses feelings of being used and devalued, which are indicative of emotional turmoil and low self-worth. the mention of staying with parents and recalling childhood trauma adds another layer of psychological distress, as unresolved past abuse is resurfacing, causing continuous emotional pain. these elements collectively illustrate a state of significant stress, characterized by persistent negative emotions, impaired daily functioning, and an inability to process and move past traumatic experiences."
I don't necessarily want to come out and tell my story in hopes that someone bites. But I'm a survivor of psychological and physical abuse as a child... the abuser is my younger sister's dad. She is 20 and I'm 26. She isn't old enough to remember all that me and our older sister went thru. She defends him so much...,1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to the mention of past psychological and physical abuse. the writer expresses a reluctance to share their story, which can be indicative of lingering trauma and the difficulty in confronting painful memories. the mention of the abuser being their younger sister's father adds complexity to the family dynamics, contributing to ongoing emotional strain. the writer's frustration and sense of injustice are evident in their observation that their younger sister defends the abuser, highlighting a lack of validation and support within the family. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress stemming from unresolved trauma and current familial tensions."
I wasn't sure when I argued with him and she said that when him and I were breaking up and I asked if he still is attracted to me (and he had said yes but now I know otherwise) that is considered as arguing. I explained that I just wanted to understand because I was so thrown. She said that it counts as arguing and there is no point to ask him that and she built on that and said some other stuff that expressed that I am wrong to feel this way. I finally told her that I am sick and tired of being told that I cannot feel betrayed/hurt. I didn't stay at ex's place for an hour because we were arguing.,1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of emotional turmoil and confusion, which are common indicators of stress. the individual describes a situation involving a breakup and a subsequent argument, where their feelings of betrayal and hurt are invalidated by another person. the repeated questioning of their own emotions and the need for clarification about whether their interaction counts as arguing suggest a heightened state of anxiety and self-doubt. the phrase ""i was so thrown"" indicates a strong emotional reaction to the situation, and the frustration expressed in ""i am sick and tired of being told that i cannot feel betrayed/hurt"" underscores a deep sense of emotional distress. additionally, the narrative reflects a struggle to communicate effectively and to have their feelings acknowledged, which are often signs of stress. the overall tone and content of the narrative highlight the individual's ongoing emotional conflict and the impact of the unresolved breakup on their mental state."

I also dreamt about terrible things happening to my newborn daughter, kidnappings, terrible accidents and finally the last straw: Me inapproapriately touching her in the bath and her felating me. That is my nightmare image burned into my mind.",1,"the narrative reveals a deeply disturbing and distressing mental state, characterized by intrusive and inappropriate thoughts and dreams. the individual describes vivid and unsettling dreams involving family members in sexual contexts, which are highly indicative of inner turmoil and anxiety. the specific mention of these dreams worsening suggests an escalating pattern of distress. the inclusion of scenarios involving harm and inappropriate behavior towards a newborn daughter highlights significant anxiety and fear for the child's safety, as well as guilt and self-loathing about the nature of these thoughts. these elements are classic indicators of acute stress, potentially compounded by feelings of shame and confusion about the origin and content of these dreams. the language used conveys a sense of urgency and desperation, underscoring the individual's struggle to cope with these intrusive thoughts and the emotional burden they carry."

Please know that I am not some dead beat who doesn't support his kids, looking for a hand out. I've always been able to provide for my kids and I never expected this to happen. <url>",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is taking proactive steps to address their situation and appears to be in control of their circumstances. the person mentions having a paypal account and setting up a gofundme, indicating they are organized and resourceful. they also express a willingness to repay any financial assistance, which suggests a sense of responsibility and integrity. the reassurance that they are not seeking a handout and have historically provided for their children demonstrates a level of confidence and self-assurance. overall, the tone of the narrative lacks the urgency, helplessness, or overwhelming emotional distress that are often indicators of stress. instead, it portrays someone who is managing their situation with a clear plan and a positive outlook."
"Spring 2102 I began to see a man that I worked with and that only made my roommate jealous and angry. I went to a pdoc (who was basically a pharmaceutical dispensary and appointments only lasted 15 minutes) who diagnosed me with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and caffeine dependency. My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).",0,"the narrative describes a series of challenging events and interpersonal conflicts, but the individual recounts these experiences with a sense of resolution and progress. despite being diagnosed with multiple mental health conditions and dealing with a difficult roommate situation, the author demonstrates a capacity for taking decisive actions, such as catching the roommate's illegal activities and evicting him. the narrative ends on a positive note, indicating a stable and long-term relationship with the new partner. these aspects suggest that while the author faced stressful situations, they were able to manage and overcome them effectively, reflecting resilience and a lack of ongoing stress."
"I’m a previous victim of abuse at home and since moving to university (the abuse ended way before uni) I’ve experienced very frequent nightmares both relating to and completely unrelated to my previous problems. It’s hard for me to go more than 3 nights without having at least a couple of nightmares a night, most of which relating to my trauma. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, would anyone be able to offer some advice on how to address these nightmares as they’re starting to affect my studies. Thank you in advance",1,"the narrative presents several clear indicators of stress. the individual describes a history of abuse, which is a significant traumatic experience likely to contribute to ongoing psychological distress. frequent nightmares, particularly those related to past trauma, are a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and indicate a high level of stress. the mention of these nightmares occurring almost nightly and their impact on the person's studies further highlights the severity of the stress. the individual’s plea for advice and support suggests a struggle to cope with these symptoms independently, reinforcing the presence of significant stress. these elements collectively point to a person experiencing considerable psychological strain."
I leave and breakdown in the kitchen because I’m still scared and freaked out. And the fact that I feel that I have to apologize for being triggered and am unable to control my reaction infuriates me. The part that confuses me is that when I was assaulted as a child I was never held down. I was frozen in fear. So why am I panicking over this seemingly innocent situation?,1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the author describes a physical and emotional breakdown, which is a clear sign of acute stress response. the use of words like ""scared,"" ""freaked out,"" ""infuriates,"" and ""panicking"" highlight intense emotional turmoil. the author also mentions feeling triggered and apologizing for their reaction, which suggests a heightened state of anxiety and self-blame, common in individuals experiencing stress. the confusion over their reaction to the current situation, linked to a past traumatic event, indicates unresolved trauma and the presence of intrusive memories, both of which are typical stress responses. these elements collectively underscore a significant level of psychological distress."

He is the most distingusting person to be around.",0,"the narrative describes a situation involving a family member whose behavior changes with alcohol consumption. the individual notices a positive shift in family dynamics when this person is absent, which could suggest underlying tension. however, the narrative lacks the personal distress or emotional turmoil typical of someone experiencing significant stress. instead, it focuses more on observations and the impact of the family member's behavior on the household rather than on the narrator's internal state. the absence of language indicating personal anxiety, worry, or overwhelming emotions supports the classification. the narrative reads as a reflective account rather than an expression of personal stress."

"This is one if the most perplexing symptoms I get when I'm in high anxiety or panic mode. It's the only time I can think of as yawning as being stressful. I have a lot of fatigue anxiety.

I've almost fallen asleep after calming down and then I have a big yawn and that just restarts it.",1,"the narrative describes a cyclical pattern of anxiety and fatigue, which are common indicators of stress. the individual mentions experiencing high anxiety or panic, which are acute stress responses. the reference to yawning being stressful highlights a unique symptom tied to their anxiety, indicating how pervasive and disruptive their stress is. the fatigue anxiety cycle, where increased anxiety leads to more fatigue and vice versa, exemplifies how stress can create a feedback loop that exacerbates symptoms. the mention of almost falling asleep but then being jolted awake by a yawn suggests a difficulty in achieving relaxation or rest, further supporting the presence of stress. these elements collectively illustrate a significant struggle with managing stress and its physical manifestations."

How should I bring it up again? ---",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, particularly through expressions of frustration and self-doubt. the mention of being ""annoyed"" highlights an emotional response often linked to stress. the writer's concern about whether the other person cares about their feelings suggests a sense of emotional neglect or insecurity, which can be stressful. the internal conflict about not wanting to appear ""needy or controlling"" indicates a fear of judgment or misunderstanding, common in stressful situations. questioning whether they are ""overreacting"" and wondering how to address the issue again reveals uncertainty and anxiety about interpersonal communication, both of which are typical stress responses. these elements collectively point to an underlying tension and concern that are characteristic of a stressed individual."

"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made. Thoughts?",0,"the narrative presents a detailed and coherent argument against the misconception that homeless individuals choose to be homeless due to laziness or a desire to avoid responsibilities. the author articulates their disagreement with this view, providing reasons why it is flawed and highlighting the complex factors contributing to homelessness, such as substance abuse, mental health issues, and social network breakdowns. the tone of the narrative is rational and reflective, focusing on societal attitudes and misconceptions rather than personal distress. the author's engagement with the topic suggests a thoughtful consideration of social issues rather than a personal emotional struggle, which aligns with a non-stressed state of mind."
"We had begun to get more sexual, having to say hey let's not do anything this date instead of just doing something when it naturally happens and when we want it to. The reason why I told you about February is that I'm having that same feeling about being with someone else, only this time it's directed towards a particular girl. I've known this girl since 7th grade, I met my girlfriend in 9th grade when she moved here. I asked her out before my girlfriend and got lowkey denied, but she was too nice to tell me straight up no. I've changed significantly since then, however, and she's been subtly flirting with me for about a month.",0,"the narrative discusses the dynamics of a romantic relationship and the author's feelings towards another person. it highlights changes in sexual behavior and the emergence of feelings for someone else. the author reflects on past experiences and mentions subtle flirting from a long-time acquaintance. while the narrative contains elements of relationship complexity and personal reflection, it lacks indicators of acute stress such as overwhelming anxiety, significant emotional distress, or feelings of being unable to cope. the tone appears more contemplative and introspective rather than distressed or overwhelmed, suggesting that the author is navigating their feelings and relationships thoughtfully rather than under significant stress."
"We seem to be talking and accidentally being together more often in school, making what I think are feelings towards her only stronger. I can't bring myself to bring this up with her because I'm scared that we will have a repeat of February again. I love her so much but I feel that if I have these feelings about other girls am I really devoted to her? This is in no way her fault, she has done nothing to deserve my questioning of my decision, this is my problem and mine alone. I am reluctant to bring this up with her because I'm worried that she might break up with me because I do truly still love her I'm just wondering if this other girl is a passing thought more focused than earlier and something I can overcome.",1,"the narrative displays several key indicators of stress, particularly related to emotional conflict and relationship anxiety. the individual expresses a fear of repeating past negative experiences, which suggests a lingering trauma or unresolved issue from february. this fear is compounded by their hesitation to communicate openly with their partner, reflecting a significant internal struggle and worry about potential consequences. the questioning of their own feelings and devotion introduces a layer of self-doubt and guilt, which are common stress responses. the narrative also highlights the individual's sense of responsibility for the situation, emphasizing that they view the problem as their own burden to bear, which can intensify feelings of isolation and stress. overall, the combination of fear, self-doubt, and reluctance to communicate are clear indicators of the psychological strain the individual is experiencing."
I have a question about my ex who has a past of violence against women. I was never warned about it but I found out he was violent and I left.

"I tried explaining this to her, but she said I should have redone it and she would never have turned something like that into her boss. When she asked me to work on it, she asked for information.

I simply told him that I'm not his wife so he doesn't owe me any explanation and that he should just leave.",1,"the narrative reflects a high level of emotional turmoil and anger, which are typical indicators of stress. the writer describes feeling an intense desire to curse or hit someone, suggesting a loss of control over their emotions. the situation involves a confrontation, which often heightens stress levels. the mention of a personal relationship and the need to set boundaries by telling the person to leave indicates an underlying tension and unresolved issues. the writer's reaction to the confrontation, combined with the evident anger and frustration, points to significant emotional distress."
My 42 yr old sister-in-law died of metastatic breast cancer last night after a 6 year battle. I am trying to raise funds to establish an endowed scholarship in her name through Olivet-Nazarene University in Illinois to help students with interests in music to honor her memory. Why would you consider giving to a stranger? Because maybe cancer has touched YOUR life. Donna was your everyday woman.,0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loss and grief due to the death of a family member from a prolonged illness. despite the emotional weight of the situation, the focus shifts towards a proactive and constructive response—raising funds for a scholarship in memory of the deceased. the author articulates a clear and organized plan to honor their sister-in-law's legacy, which suggests a level of coping and resilience. the mention of ""why would you consider giving to a stranger?"" followed by an empathetic appeal indicates an attempt to connect with others on a shared human experience rather than an expression of personal distress. the overall tone, while solemn, is forward-looking and centered on creating a positive impact, demonstrating an ability to manage emotions and channel them into meaningful action."
"I was laid off work temporarily and the insurance I was getting stopped over a week ago suddenly. I can't get back to work until next Monday earliest. I sold some stuff online locally a few days ago, got more stuff listed but it's not moving and almost all of what I made online went to fee's when I renewed my license plates. I have literally nothing but a few days more of plain rice left. I figured I may as well give this sub a shot.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily due to financial instability and uncertainty about the future. the individual describes being laid off temporarily, which is a common source of stress as it directly impacts financial security and employment stability. the sudden cessation of insurance exacerbates the stress, as it introduces concerns about healthcare and potential medical expenses. the attempts to sell items online to generate income, coupled with the frustration of high fees eating into the earnings, highlight the desperation and limited resources available. the mention of having only a few days of plain rice left underscores the severity of the financial strain and the immediate worry about basic needs like food. the decision to seek help from a community or sub indicates a sense of urgency and a lack of alternative solutions, further illustrating the stress the individual is experiencing. these elements collectively point to a high-stress situation driven by financial hardship and uncertainty about the future."
"I had been raped by two different people as a kid. Between ages 5 to 8 I was raped by someone who's name I wont even call out, and when I was eleven I was raped by this odd couple (the guy raped me, the woman just was present while it was happening). I don't know if it's that or that every time I have had a crush on someone, that someone always fall for one of my best friends, but I really feel like I wont be able to have sex unless I am extremely drunk. It's not really about losing my virginity anymore, because it has already been stolen, but it's about not freaking out. How did you guys do it?",1,"the narrative reveals significant emotional trauma and distress stemming from repeated sexual abuse during childhood. the individual recounts being raped by multiple perpetrators, which is a profound and deeply distressing experience that can lead to long-term psychological issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), anxiety, and depression. the narrative also expresses a sense of helplessness and self-blame, evident in the mention of having crushes that never reciprocate and the belief that they might only be able to engage in sexual activity while extremely intoxicated. this indicates a deep-seated fear and anxiety around intimacy and sexual relationships, which are common among survivors of sexual trauma. the person's struggle with the concept of virginity and the feeling of it being ""stolen"" further underscores the loss of control and violation they have experienced. the plea for advice on how to cope with these feelings highlights a sense of isolation and a desperate need for support and understanding. these elements collectively suggest a high level of psychological stress and trauma."
"I developed and was diagnosed with PTSD 5 months later. I was having trouble sleeping (still kind of do), hypervigilant, moody and suicidal at times. I never thought I would make it through...but looking back,I used every single coping skill possible to survive, even if that meant calling crisis every day. I'm not perfect today but I really see the light at the end of the tunnel. I look forward to my future.",0,"the narrative reflects a journey of significant personal struggle, particularly with symptoms commonly associated with ptsd, such as trouble sleeping, hypervigilance, mood swings, and suicidal ideation. however, despite these challenges, the individual describes a process of actively employing coping skills and seeking help, such as calling crisis lines, to manage their condition. the mention of seeing ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and looking forward to the future indicates a sense of hope and resilience. this forward-looking perspective and the ability to recognize progress and potential for improvement are strong indicators of a positive mental state, suggesting that the individual is not currently experiencing high levels of stress."
"Hi PTSD forums, Selective mutism has been something i have been afflicted with for 7 years since middle school. It was only in senior year of high school that I began speaking again thanks to the help of a few friends whom i no longer am in contact with and also my football coach/teacher. Now in college however I dread presentations. Often, I would lock down and say one or two sentences and after that say ""i'm done, ill hand it off to my group member"" or I would splurge out incoherent sentences that have no purpose or thought behind them during presentations and people would have a confused look on their faces.",0,"the narrative describes the individual's experience with selective mutism, which began in middle school and was somewhat alleviated by supportive friends and a coach in high school. despite this progress, the person still experiences significant anxiety and dread when faced with public speaking in college, leading to physical and verbal manifestations of stress, such as locking down, speaking incoherently, and relying on group members to take over. while these experiences highlight challenges and discomfort in specific situations, the narrative does not convey a pervasive sense of ongoing stress or crisis beyond these contexts. the individual reflects on their past and current struggles with a degree of self-awareness and acknowledgment of specific triggers, which can be seen as a coping mechanism and a sign of managing their condition within certain limits. the focus on specific situational anxiety rather than a generalized or constant state of distress is a key aspect here."
"How do I handle this without looking petty or selfish? ** **Edit: I'm getting a lot of replies telling me that I just need to stop letting her push me around. I know that, and the whole idea behind posting here was to get some advice on how to do just that. I truly appreciate the advice that most of y'all have given me, and will definitely be having a conversation with her letting her know that it's nothing personal against her, I just don't want to have a workout partner at all.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of seeking guidance and advice rather than expressing significant emotional distress. the individual is concerned with social dynamics and how to communicate boundaries effectively, which is a common interpersonal issue but not necessarily indicative of stress. the use of polite language and the intention to have a constructive conversation suggest a level-headed approach to resolving the situation. the mention of appreciation for the advice received and the plan to handle the matter calmly further indicates a rational and composed state of mind. overall, the narrative lacks markers of acute stress such as overwhelming emotions, negative self-talk, or a sense of helplessness, which supports the interpretation of the individual not experiencing significant stress."
"I don't mind the fact that she goes, I don't even mind if she goes at the same time as me. I just wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of doing it together. How do I convey this to her without looking like a selfish asshole? **Tl;dr: I prefer to work out by myself for various reasons. My roommate decided to start going with me and is requesting that I make accommodations to my schedule and routine so that she can join me.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress. the writer expresses a sense of frustration and internal conflict about their roommate's request to join their workout routine. the use of phrases like ""i just wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of doing it together"" suggests an underlying irritation and a feeling of being pressured to change their personal habits. the concern about not wanting to appear ""like a selfish asshole"" indicates anxiety about social perception and a fear of potential conflict. these elements, combined with the need to balance personal preferences with the roommate's desires, create a scenario that is typical of someone experiencing stress. the struggle to communicate their needs without causing tension further highlights the emotional burden they are carrying."
"I’m fairly new at directly helping the poor. Been creating bags to give out that has food, bandaids, nail clippers, tooth brush and toothpaste, small shampoo and bar of soap, and some items are gender or age specific. But what else would you suggest? I’ve heard of gloves and socks but not sure where to get them cheap and in bulk. I want to create at least 100 bags and do it a few times per year.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is engaged in a charitable activity, specifically creating care bags for the poor. the tone is proactive and focused on problem-solving, as evidenced by the detailed list of items included in the bags and the inquiry about additional useful items. the person's concern is practical, centered around the logistics of obtaining supplies affordably and in bulk. there is no indication of emotional distress or overwhelming anxiety. instead, the narrative reflects a sense of purpose and constructive planning. these characteristics suggest a state of mind that is organized and goal-oriented, typical of someone who is managing their responsibilities effectively without signs of significant stress."
"After getting startled, I have this thing where I'm really angry and defensive for 30-120 minutes afterwards. I can put myself in the most calm of situations, but the duration of this seems to be somewhat independent of my environment. I'm guessing this is because my PTSD brain does not respond well to stress hormones? Sometimes I try to push through it and just go about my day anyway, but it's usually counter-productive. I'd like to train my service dog to alert to the physiological change.",1,"the narrative describes a persistent and intense emotional reaction following startling events, indicative of an underlying psychological condition such as ptsd. the individual mentions a prolonged period of anger and defensiveness that does not easily dissipate, regardless of efforts to create a calm environment. this suggests an ongoing struggle with managing stress responses. the reference to ""my ptsd brain"" and the difficulty in handling stress hormones are clear signs of chronic stress and trauma. the person's attempt to push through these episodes, despite recognizing it as counter-productive, highlights a continuous battle with stress management. additionally, the consideration of training a service dog to help manage physiological changes points to a significant impact on daily functioning, further supporting the presence of considerable stress."
"I've been assured this last repair will fix everything, however it won't be out of the shop until late next week. I'm $200 short on rent. I have money from a TSP coming to me, however I just sent in the paperwork today, and it usually takes about 2 weeks for the money to get to me (especially with the holiday). I will be able to repay this $200 in about 2 weeks, and have no problem paying interest. I live in Philadelphia, PA.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is facing some logistical and financial challenges, such as waiting for a car repair and being short on rent money. despite these issues, the tone remains relatively calm and solution-focused. the person has a plan to resolve the financial shortfall by accessing funds from a tsp and is proactive in addressing the situation by submitting the necessary paperwork. the willingness to pay interest and the mention of a specific timeline for repayment indicate a level of control and confidence in managing the circumstances. these elements suggest that while the individual is dealing with some stressors, they are not overwhelmed or exhibiting signs of significant distress."
"This question is not meant to be disrespectful in any way, shape, or form to people who 1) are actually diagnosed autistic, or 2) are in no way autistic, but just suffer from severe social anxieties. This is just about my experience and people who may relate. So, throughout my life, I sometimes struggled with the feeling that there is something ""different"" about myself. A lot of the time I've convinced myself it was just because of low self-esteem, paranoia, or a desire to have some type of diagnosis that would help ""solve"" or explain my awkwardness or social issues. People warn me not to jump to conclusions and it's easy to self-diagnose online in this day and age.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is introspective and self-aware, discussing their experiences and thoughts without displaying significant signs of distress. the writer is contemplating their social challenges and the possibility of underlying conditions, but they approach these thoughts with a level of detachment and rationality. they acknowledge their tendencies towards self-diagnosis and the influence of modern technology on this behavior, yet they also heed advice from others to avoid hasty conclusions. this balanced perspective and the absence of language indicating acute emotional turmoil or overwhelming anxiety suggest that the individual is managing their concerns thoughtfully and without significant stress."
Maybe anyone with a history of abuse or trauma can tell me if there are particular things to be sensitive to here: I tried to be supportive but obviously failed in the end here. She's talking about wanting to divorce me. We're looking into couples therapy. I really appreciate any insight or advice. **TLDR**: Wife is working on an art piece that is important for her career in the arts non-profit world.,1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, starting with the mention of a history of abuse or trauma, which often predisposes individuals to heightened stress responses. the author's concern about failing to be supportive suggests feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, common in stressed individuals. the mention of potential divorce and the consideration of couples therapy indicate significant relational strain, a major source of stress. seeking advice and insight from others underscores a sense of urgency and desperation, often found in those experiencing high stress levels. the importance of the wife's art piece for her career adds another layer of pressure, as the outcome of this project likely impacts both their professional and personal lives. these elements collectively point to a state of heightened stress, characterized by emotional turmoil, relational conflict, and external pressures."
"He is our little angel and we are both gaga for him, but money has been extraordinary tight, adjusting to parent life and sleep deprivation has been tough for both of us. We were fighting and bickering a bit for the first time in his first months of life, but I figured that was normal for new parents. I work in the financial industry for a modest income (working hard currently to get to the next level where I'll make substantially more) and she works for an arts-based nonprofit. I have no particular attachment to the financial industry, it's just been a way to pay the bills and I find it interesting enough. She's a passionate artist though, always knew she wanted to be one, and it's really important to her.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly through the discussion of financial strain, sleep deprivation, and adjustments to parenthood. the mention of money being ""extraordinarily tight"" highlights financial stress, a common source of anxiety and tension. the adjustment to parent life, coupled with sleep deprivation, further exacerbates stress levels, as both factors significantly impact emotional and physical well-being. the description of fighting and bickering, even if perceived as normal for new parents, suggests underlying stress affecting the relationship dynamics. the narrator's job in the financial industry, which they have no particular attachment to, indicates a potential lack of fulfillment and added stress from working hard to achieve a higher income. in contrast, the partner's passion for art and commitment to her nonprofit job underscores a potential disparity in job satisfaction, which can contribute to overall household stress. these elements collectively illustrate a scenario laden with stressors typical of new parenthood, financial pressures, and professional dissatisfaction."
"We met about 2.5 years ago, both somewhat fresh off our respective divorces. I felt we had a real connection, we fell for each other hard, dated (eventually lived together) for a little less than a year before she got pregnant. We were both really happy as we had both talked about wanting children - at the time we got pregnant we were ""not NOT trying,"" we had definitely had many conversations and were both on board and happy to have a child together. We felt we had met our true love in each other. Things have been rough since the birth of our son.",1,"the narrative highlights a series of significant life events, including recent divorces, a new relationship, cohabitation, and the birth of a child. these events are inherently stressful due to their impact on personal identity, emotional stability, and daily routines. the mention of things being ""rough"" since the birth of their son suggests ongoing challenges and adjustments that often accompany new parenthood, such as sleep deprivation, increased responsibilities, and potential shifts in the relationship dynamic. the initial happiness and mutual desire for a child contrast sharply with the current difficulties, indicating a potential sense of loss or disappointment. these elements collectively point to heightened stress levels, as the individual navigates the complexities of blending families, managing expectations, and coping with the demands of a newborn."
"She was soon Baker Acted, and spent a week in a mental hospital before she convinced her parents to somehow get her out. A few weeks later she begged me to take her back and see how much she had changed, and I did. She's on medication now and still seeing a therapist occasionally. However, after a few months things reverted back to how they were before, minus the suicide threats. Fast forward to the present.",0,"the narrative describes a series of events involving a person who has experienced significant mental health challenges, including hospitalization and ongoing therapy. despite the serious nature of these events, the overall tone of the narrative suggests a sense of stability and management. the individual in question is now on medication and continues to see a therapist, indicating proactive steps toward mental health maintenance. while there is mention of a regression to previous behaviors, the absence of suicide threats and the ongoing support systems in place imply that the situation is under control. the narrative lacks expressions of acute distress or overwhelming emotions from the narrator, which are often indicators of stress. instead, it presents a factual recounting of events with a focus on the actions taken to address the issues, suggesting a level of acceptance and coping rather than current stress."
"Due to recent medical issues of mine (I was hospitalized for anorexia), we had to pay 1,000 dollars for my hospital bills. We paid our bills due to help from a relative, but now we have nothing left. My mom is sick and can't work, my brother is mentally disabled, as is my sister. I feel defeated, I don't want to beg, but I have no options left. Any help would be appreciated (We have been to our food bank, but four people consume a lot of food.",1,"the narrative reveals multiple indicators of stress, beginning with the recent hospitalization for anorexia, a serious medical condition often associated with significant psychological distress. the financial strain of paying 1,000 dollars in hospital bills, despite assistance from a relative, adds another layer of pressure. the situation is further exacerbated by the mother’s illness preventing her from working, and the mental disabilities of both the brother and sister, which likely contribute to the overall burden on the family. the narrator expresses feelings of defeat and a reluctance to beg, which are indicative of a sense of hopelessness and desperation. the mention of seeking help from a food bank underscores the severity of their financial struggles and the ongoing challenge of meeting basic needs for a family of four. these elements collectively highlight a high level of stress stemming from health, financial, and familial pressures."
"Hey guys, how are you? So, I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder for 6 years now, though I know I've had it for more than ten years, I just didn't know it was an anxiety issue. I'm a 30 years old straight dude who started struggling with anxiety when I started to think I was gay (now I know this thing is called HOCD, but at the time I even came out as bisexual to my mother). After I went to therapy hoping to accept my sexuality, I discovered my problem wasn't self acceptance but an anxiety disorder, so that made sense, because I came out as bisexual even though I don't feel attracted to men. I thought I was burying my desires or something like that.",0,"the narrative details a personal journey of self-discovery and understanding of one's mental health condition. the individual recounts a history of anxiety disorder and the confusion surrounding their sexual orientation. they describe how therapy helped clarify that their struggles were rooted in anxiety rather than issues of self-acceptance. this reflects a level of self-awareness and insight that is typical of someone who has sought and received effective mental health support. the narrative lacks signs of acute distress or overwhelming stress; instead, it shows a reflective and somewhat resolved perspective on past challenges. the tone is calm and explanatory, suggesting that the individual is not currently experiencing significant stress related to the discussed issues."
"I get that three mistakes in a row is nothing new, I've seen coworkers make that many in a day. I just can't shake the very strong feeling that this person may not be a safe person to be around and I have no idea if that is a helpful gut feeling or if it's a weird and new manifestation of the PTSD (I've never had this issue before, previously people only triggered my ptsd when refusing to let me leave or when being quite physically aggressive) Obviously I am going to talk to the PTSD counselor about this to see what they think but I have to decide about this appointment by first thing tomorrow (13.5 hours from posting) whether to trust them enough to keep the appointment, or to cancel it for now so I don't risk getting kicked out from appointment mixups. I'd try in a new city in a couple months when I have a stable living situation. Is there a way to gauge if someone is unsafe or if I'm paranoid?",1,"the narrative demonstrates several indicators of stress, particularly related to anxiety and uncertainty. the author expresses a strong sense of unease about a person, which they attribute to their ptsd. this concern about safety and trustworthiness is compounded by their history of ptsd triggers, which previously involved more overtly aggressive behaviors. the author is clearly grappling with distinguishing between a legitimate gut feeling and a potential new manifestation of their ptsd symptoms. their urgency is palpable, as they mention a tight deadline to make a decision about an appointment, adding to their stress. the mention of consulting a ptsd counselor highlights their proactive approach to managing their mental health, yet underscores the weight of their current anxiety. the consideration of moving to a new city for a more stable situation further illustrates the depth of their distress and the lengths they are willing to go to find peace of mind. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that signal significant stress, including fear, indecision, time pressure, and the impact of past trauma on current perceptions."
"My PTSD was starting to flare up (due to potentially having to go back into the traumatizing situation) and I asked for assistance finding low cost therapy for that in my city and I was given an address to go to for that, as well as a program name for my physical disability. I went to the place about the therapy immediately, I also asked about the program which they had never heard of. I googled it and it says that that specific program is for a very different demographic living in group homes. I was confused but accidents happen with names changing all the time in government programs and such. When I went to my follow up appointment with the social work place, the front desk lady said I didn't have an appointment.",1,"the narrative details an individual's experience with ptsd and the challenges they face in seeking appropriate therapy and assistance. the mention of ptsd flaring up indicates a heightened state of stress, likely due to the anticipation of returning to a traumatic environment. the person's proactive steps to seek low-cost therapy suggest a need for support and relief from their symptoms. the confusion and frustration experienced when provided with incorrect information about a program, and the subsequent discovery that the program is irrelevant to their needs, further exacerbates their stress. the added complication of arriving at a follow-up appointment only to be told there is no appointment scheduled highlights a lack of reliable support systems, contributing to feelings of helplessness and stress. these elements, including the struggle to find appropriate help and the bureaucratic mishaps, are typical indicators of stress as they reflect the individual's ongoing battle with their mental health and the external obstacles they face in seeking assistance."
"For instance, there was a show on netflix that I thought would be fun to watch together, but she said she couldn't because she used to watch it with her ex and it reminds her of him. Like, are you even over him? She constantly compares me to her ex's in subtle (maybe not subtle) ways, like ""[ex] used to do this thing you do, and you know how I feel about that."" I'm not your ex, I don't think it's fair of you to compare me to him like that all the time. She says she's ""not used to being single,"" it kind of makes me feel like she's using me to get reassurance and validation.",1,"the narrative reveals a significant level of emotional distress and frustration. the individual feels undervalued and compared to their partner's ex, which can be a potent source of stress. the mention of the netflix show and the partner's refusal to watch it due to past associations with an ex highlights unresolved issues and emotional baggage that the partner brings into the current relationship. the repeated comparisons to the ex and the partner's admission of not being used to being single suggest a lack of closure and potential dependency issues. these elements can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, insecurity, and resentment in the individual, which are typical indicators of stress. the narrative expresses a sense of unfairness and a need for validation, both of which are common in stressful relational dynamics."
I’ve tried to reason with him and tell him I love him and there is no reason for him to beat me and he says that he knows I love him and I should see that he loves me too but I don’t listen to him and not listening to him will cause me to lose everything. The physical abuse really has damaged me mentally and lowered my self esteem. I’ve been super depressed and I’m scared for what I’ll do to myself if I don’t get out or if I do get out of this and have to live a life without him . We have a 3 month old daughter and he is in love with her. When he beats me I hate him but seeing him with my daughter makes my heart melt.,1,"the narrative reflects significant emotional turmoil and distress. the individual describes experiencing physical abuse, which has led to mental damage and lowered self-esteem, both of which are strong indicators of stress. the mention of being ""super depressed"" and fear of self-harm further underscores the severe psychological impact of their situation. the conflicting emotions towards their partner—hating him for the abuse but feeling warmth when seeing him with their daughter—highlight a complex and stressful emotional state. the concern for their future, whether staying in the abusive relationship or leaving and facing life without their partner, adds to the overall sense of anxiety and fear. these elements collectively suggest a high level of stress and emotional distress."
"I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either. It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away. Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the author mentions trying new medication, suggesting ongoing efforts to manage their mental health, which often accompanies stress. the reference to antidepressants turning them into an ""unfeeling zombie"" indicates a struggle with finding the right balance in treatment, a common source of stress. the description of vigilance beyond traditional anxiety highlights an acute awareness and constant state of alertness, typical of stress. embarrassment about their condition and concern about its impact on others' moods or causing social isolation are also significant stress indicators. finally, the plea for medication that soothes without adverse side effects underscores a desire for relief from these stress-related symptoms."
"He would refuse to kiss me or touch me because I was a contaminant and he would obsess about how clean and lovely Japanese idols are, etc. He would often say to me that if he ever met an Asian woman he would dump me immediately. The sexual requirements were a very stringent hygiene ritual, followed with putting on one of his idol videos and I would dress as whatever the girl was wearing such as a maid costume or whatever. He would keep his eyes on the screen while I basically gave him a blow job. Very rarely he would have sex with me, I suppose because it would mean having to look at me more than the screen, so he'd prefer just a blow job.",0,"the narrative describes a relationship dynamic characterized by emotional neglect and obsessive behaviors from one partner. the partner's fixation on cleanliness and japanese idols, coupled with the demeaning and objectifying treatment of the narrator, indicates a significant power imbalance and emotional distress. however, the narrative lacks explicit indications of the narrator's internal emotional state or stress responses. there are no direct references to feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or other common stress indicators. the focus remains on the partner's actions and preferences rather than the narrator's emotional reactions, suggesting an observational rather than a stress-expressive account."
"Hi, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here as I'm new to Reddit. I originally posted this in relationships advice but it was taken down due to the mention of abuse. The original post went like this: I met my exBF online when I was 13, he was 18, almost 19 at the time. To cut it short, he groomed me into accepting abusive behaviour from him which carried on when we moved in together when we were 20 and 25.",0,"the narrative provides a recount of a past abusive relationship which began during the author's early adolescence and continued into young adulthood. while the subject matter is undeniably serious and distressing, the author presents the information in a straightforward manner without displaying current emotional turmoil or distress. the use of past tense indicates that the author is reflecting on events that have already transpired, suggesting a degree of emotional processing and distance from the experiences. the narrative's focus on providing a clear account of events, rather than expressing ongoing emotional distress or seeking immediate support, suggests that the author may not be experiencing acute stress at the moment of writing."
"I recognise that he was not very nice but I can't get him out of my mind, I crave his attention and just wish he would want me. I know this is not healthy and good for me, but it is how I feel. I feel like I need him to tell me why he stopped loving me and what's wrong with me so I can change, but ultimately he's just not interested and I shouldn't really respect the opinion of an arsehole anyway! So I'm feeling very lost and still isolated. As I said, I seem to gravitate towards people who are not good for me and I have ended friendships recently which were obviously toxic for me.",1,"the narrative reflects a strong emotional turmoil and a preoccupation with an individual who is perceived as not nice, yet the author craves their attention and validation. this internal conflict, where the author recognizes the unhealthy nature of their feelings but remains emotionally attached, is a significant indicator of stress. the feelings of needing answers about why the relationship ended and a desire to change oneself to regain affection highlight a deep sense of insecurity and self-doubt. the mention of feeling lost and isolated further underscores the psychological distress. additionally, the tendency to gravitate towards toxic relationships and the recent ending of such friendships point to a pattern of unhealthy attachments and difficulty in establishing supportive connections, which are common indicators of stress. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that signify emotional struggle and stress."
"So I've had PTSD a few years now, coming up on a decade as of December 2018, and in the last year or so I've undergone a lot of change, for the best. I figured since I've found these things to be very important in my fight against this, that I'd share them here. First thing first is to mention therapy. You've got to do it, and it's going to fucking hurt. Medication is also important if you need it.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced ptsd for several years and highlights recent positive changes in their life. the mention of therapy and medication suggests a proactive approach to managing their condition. despite acknowledging the difficulty and pain associated with therapy, the overall tone is constructive and focused on sharing helpful strategies with others. this indicates a level of self-awareness and resilience, which are not typically consistent with high stress levels. the emphasis on positive change and the willingness to help others by sharing their experiences are indicative of someone who is managing their stress effectively rather than being overwhelmed by it."
I’m asking now because my partner told me to eat a chicken schnitzel Parma instead of my ham and cheese sandwich. I freaked out. I almost had a full-on fight with him because I didn’t want to. Felt like I couldn’t. I almost broke down into tears.,1,"the narrative shows signs of stress through the intense emotional reaction to a seemingly minor situation. the individual describes freaking out and almost having a fight over a simple food choice, which indicates heightened sensitivity and emotional volatility. the feeling of being unable to comply with the partner's suggestion and the near breakdown into tears further point to significant emotional distress. these reactions are disproportionate to the situation, suggesting underlying stress that is amplifying the individual's responses. such overreactions to everyday decisions and interactions are common indicators of stress, as they reveal a reduced capacity to cope with minor changes or challenges."
"Hi all. I recently moved to another country and it pretty much cost everything to get set up here. My roommate just moved out to start a new chapter with their significant other, taking pretty much all the furniture with them and naturally, rent has gone up. I'm wiped out until the 17th. I, my wife and daughter would appreciate any help to tide us over.",0,"the narrative describes a recent move to another country and the associated financial strain, including the departure of a roommate and the resulting increase in rent. while these circumstances could potentially be stressful, the tone of the narrative remains relatively calm and matter-of-fact. the individual outlines their situation clearly and expresses appreciation for any help, which suggests a level of coping and management rather than overwhelming stress. the mention of family support (wife and daughter) indicates a social support system, which is a significant buffer against stress. the request for assistance is straightforward and lacks signs of desperation or emotional distress, further indicating a state of managing the situation rather than being overtaken by stress."
"I was so sure that tattooing was the career I wanted to get into but after completing the apprenticeship and even working as a tattoo artist AND piercer for about a year, I find myself still fucking miserable. Maybe even worse than before. The first tattoo shop I worked for was great but I had to move and I struggled finding another shop like that one.

I told one friend and a few days ago we got into an argument and he ended up saying that it was my fault it happened. I haven’t talked to him since and I’ve deleted his number, but he keeps messaging me as if nothing happened. Am I being irrational in ignoring him for this or is he just an asshole?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress. the individual recounts a traumatic event, sexual assault, which is a significant stressor. the mention of ongoing flashbacks and anxiety are clear signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), a condition often associated with severe stress. the fact that the individual has confided in very few people suggests a level of isolation and possibly a lack of support, which can exacerbate stress. the argument with the friend and the friend's harmful response, blaming the victim, likely intensified the individual's stress, contributing to feelings of betrayal and mistrust. the decision to cut off contact with the friend and the subsequent messaging from him, despite the clear boundary set, adds to the ongoing stress. these elements combined paint a picture of someone dealing with significant emotional turmoil and stress."

"I'm sorry if I didn't post this in the right place and such, it'd be really comforting if someone had this as well and told me about it. edit: another way to describe it may be a million thoughts at once. it's really irritable.

Now I'm fucked, because I have work.",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of stress. the individual describes a series of challenging events, starting with the pressure of job hunting, which can be inherently stressful due to the uncertainty and financial concerns involved. the phrase ""she gave me hell the entire time"" suggests ongoing interpersonal conflict, which is a significant source of stress. the mention of securing a job but facing criticism and a breakup due to the start date indicates feelings of inadequacy and rejection. being kicked out of a living situation compounds the stress, as it introduces instability and potential homelessness. the culmination of these events, encapsulated in the phrase ""now i am fucked,"" reflects a high level of distress and a sense of being overwhelmed by the circumstances. these elements collectively highlight the individual's struggle with multiple stressors, both personal and professional, contributing to an overall narrative of significant stress."

"The news is always problematic for folks with PTSD, but it just feels so much worse lately. I am not one to regularly get triggered by the news, but this weekend just was too much.

"The police in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky were... decidedly unhelpful. The local citizenry sympathized with my plight in that respect. I had to hitch-hike back to Lexington. The most I've been able to replace ID-wise so far has been my ATM card and my pre-paid card -- I opened up an account at a national chain bank while I was here the past two weeks and my banker here obviously knows who I am -- and the temp labor place I had been working at had a copy of my ID, so I was able to get that information from them as well.",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of stress, such as dealing with unhelpful police, the need to hitch-hike, and the struggle to replace important identification documents. the mention of sympathetic local citizens suggests a sense of isolation and the need for external validation. the process of opening a new bank account and retrieving information from a temp labor place indicates ongoing efforts to regain stability, which can be taxing and stressful. these elements collectively highlight the challenges and emotional strain the individual is experiencing, which are typical indicators of stress."
I've heard Xanax is similar except I don't want to risk dying from having some other stuff in it cause I couldn't obtain it legally. What other options do I have?

I recognise the risk of addiction and that it's not a long-term fix.),1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of stress, primarily through the expression of desperation and the contemplation of using xanax as a coping mechanism. the author explicitly states they are ""at my wit's end,"" which signals a high level of distress and an urgent need for relief. their concern about the legality and safety of obtaining xanax illegally highlights an awareness of potential dangers, yet this is overshadowed by their immediate need for something to help them ""get through certain days."" the recognition of addiction risk and the understanding that xanax is not a long-term solution further indicate that the author is aware of the potential consequences but feels compelled to find immediate relief due to their current stress levels. these elements collectively underscore the narrative's portrayal of someone experiencing significant stress."

"Post contains spoilers for Spider-Man : Homecoming. I was the first responder to a fatal plane crash in Australia in January 2017, and have been dealing with my PTSD since then. I’ve been lucky to avoid most triggers now I’m back in the UK, but watching Spider-Man tonight there’s a scene where a plane crashes into a beach, and my mind is all over the place with my heart rate through the roof. If anyone has any suggestions for how to deal with this please do say, I haven’t been in therapy for a while x",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of stress, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd). the individual describes being a first responder to a fatal plane crash, which is a highly traumatic event. they explicitly mention dealing with ptsd since the incident, which underscores the long-term psychological impact of their experience. the specific example of the plane crash scene in spider-man triggering a severe reaction, such as an elevated heart rate and mental distress, is a clear sign of stress. the plea for suggestions on how to cope further emphasizes their current struggle with managing these symptoms. the context of avoiding triggers since returning to the uk suggests ongoing efforts to mitigate stress, but the unexpected trigger from the movie highlights the persistent and unpredictable nature of their condition. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements typical of someone experiencing significant stress and trauma-related symptoms."
"I just need to get this off my chest with people who will get it.

Or some sort of combination of both. I can't see other options. I just have ended up feeling guilty for self-advocacy because I have this internalized feeling (only just now realizing I have this) from my past that he was right, I am just crazy and needy and the abuse was justified.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of stress through the author's expression of confusion and internal conflict. the individual is grappling with the uncertainty of their reactions, questioning whether their feelings are valid or a result of ptsd, which suggests a deep-seated struggle with past trauma. this internal debate is compounded by feelings of guilt and self-doubt, as evidenced by the realization of internalized negative beliefs about themselves. the mention of abuse and the self-labeling as ""crazy and needy"" further highlight the presence of stress and emotional turmoil. these elements collectively indicate a state of heightened stress and psychological distress."
"We were living together and life was pretty sweet. But she's my ex for a reason, right? In any case, the last two years after college got rough eventually.

"Anyway, I just sort of got the news and don't even know if I'm posting this right. I don't even know what I'm ask for or how to do this. I feel embarrassed and vulnerable to everything right now.

"No history of DV, married 8 years, together 10 years, nothing like this has ever happened before. We have two children, 2 & 5 that unfortunately witnessed nearly everything. Sunday night we had both been drinking, she was significantly more intoxicated than I (likely due to not eating much that day.) She came out of our bedroom and started ""doing"" the dishes - slamming everything in the process. I raised my voice telling her to go to bed and I would handle the dishes - she snapped, started screaming, hitting me in the chest (slapping to be a little more precise if alcohol+adrenaline actually allow for vivid memory recollection) before I know it she has a knife - I take it out of her hand and grab the second knife that was in sight (dinner had recently been prepared, we used multiple knives to do so) I threw them both in the trashcan, but her rampage continued and she soon had yet another knife in her hand, this time pointed directly (or close to) her heart, stating that she wanted it to all be over, never wanted any of this (we relocated 800 miles for my work approx 3 weeks ago and left behind every friend and family member we have that could help either of us right now) I grabbed both of her wrists and we struggled, we both hit the ground and I held her down until I could remove the knife from the situation - at some point I was stabbed just above my thumb even though I did not realize it until minutes later.",1,"the narrative describes a highly volatile and distressing situation marked by intense emotional and physical conflict. the individual recounts an incident where their spouse, under the influence of alcohol, became aggressive and violent, which escalated to a life-threatening scenario involving multiple knives. the presence of children witnessing the event adds to the psychological strain, as does the recent major life change of relocating far from their support network. these elements indicate significant stress, as the individual is dealing with immediate danger, emotional turmoil, and the pressure of managing a crisis without external support. the detailed recollection of the incident, including the physical altercation and the injury sustained, further highlights the acute stress response and the impact on the individual's mental state. the narrative reflects classic signs of stress such as heightened emotions, aggressive behavior, and a sense of being overwhelmed by circumstances beyond control."
"Hey guys I have PTSD from years of emotional abuse and neglect by my narcissistic parents.

Sorry for the lack of detail/emotion but I am so drained.",1,"the narrative contains several clear indicators of stress. the individual mentions having ptsd from years of emotional abuse and neglect, which already sets a foundation for high levels of psychological distress. living with their narcissistic parents again due to financial hardships adds another layer of stress, as it reintroduces the toxic environment that originally caused their trauma. the mention of being constantly triggered and experiencing intensified symptoms highlights ongoing acute stress responses. feeling completely trapped and needing to manage symptoms that interfere with daily functioning are strong signals of overwhelming stress. the apology for the lack of detail and emotion, coupled with the statement of feeling drained, further suggests emotional exhaustion and a diminished capacity to cope. all these aspects collectively point to a significant level of stress in the individual's current situation."

I know this is unhealthy, and I will be addressing it with my therapist, however I was hoping to get some input from fellow reddit users with PTSD.",1,"the narrative describes a vivid and violent imagery that the author finds distressing rather than amusing. the physical symptoms mentioned, such as headaches, taut and sore shoulder blades, a closing throat, increased heart rate, and labored breathing, are classic indicators of a stress response. these physiological reactions are consistent with the body's fight-or-flight response, which is often triggered by perceived threats or distressing thoughts. the author's acknowledgment of the unhealthy nature of these reactions and their intention to discuss them with a therapist further highlights an awareness of their stress. seeking input from others with ptsd suggests a desire for shared experiences and coping mechanisms, which is typical for individuals trying to manage stress and trauma. the narrative clearly reflects the author's struggle with stress and the impact it has on their physical and mental well-being."

I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and celebratory tone, with the author expressing pride and happiness about their progress and current situation. they mention significant personal growth, particularly in overcoming past trauma and feeling comfortable discussing boundaries. the supportive and understanding interaction with stephanie, along with the anticipation of a second date, contributes to a sense of well-being and contentment. these elements, including the use of positive language and the focus on personal achievements and positive relationships, are indicative of an individual not currently experiencing stress."

"Almost too well. She extends our date twice, buys us a drink each, starts a make out session which lasts for 2 hours, calls me hot, and although neither of us had a house free she gave me oral too. Although she said she had a great time - which I replied to - I then waited to respond to her next message, and I don't know if that killed any momentum because I was already very delayed when we first got talking of course. Anyway, despite our great date and a second one lined up when I asked her out a day later, she ended up cancelling on me, and then told me a week later that she got more serious with another guy - which to me only translated as him being hot and me being ugly. They broke things off a week later, and she did ask me out again, but at one stage I annoyed her with a jokey message.",1,"the narrative reveals several signs of stress. the individual recounts a sequence of events with a potential romantic partner, highlighting moments of self-doubt and insecurity. despite positive interactions and affirmations from the other person, such as extending the date, engaging in intimate activities, and calling them ""hot,"" the narrator fixates on perceived failures and delays in communication. the cancellation of the second date and the partner's brief involvement with another person intensifies these feelings, leading to negative self-assessments and assumptions about their attractiveness. the individual also expresses concern over potentially ruining future chances with a ""jokey message,"" indicating ongoing anxiety about their actions and their impact on relationships. these elements collectively suggest a heightened state of stress, characterized by rumination, self-criticism, and sensitivity to social rejection."
