I have tried to make plans but they don??t seem motivated. One of the only people I could consider a best friend also recently got into a relationship.

So I was on a online relationship with a girl I met while playing xbox, We used to talk the entire time, text all the time, for me life was awesome at that point. Couple of weeks passed and she doesn??t reply like before so I think ??maybe she??s busy doing her stuff?? just gonna wait ya know. I was getting worried, all my insecurities triggered like maybe she??s with someone else or maybe she doesn??t want to talk anymore, I was thinking a lot of stuff. I was suffering those days until I decided to break up with her, couldn??t handle it. She said it was fine, that we should just be friends because she didn??t have the time to talk to me like before (due to her job and school), main reason I??m posting here is that I got used to hanging with her the entire time, now I feel very lonely and empty.

"human connection? who is shemy best friend is someone i met online a few years back. they know everything about me and understand me so well and vice versa. i cherish them so much. i??ve never met them irl. my sister is probably the person i love most in this world, we are extremely different but love each other unconditionally and facetime every other day. she??s also long distance. i only see her a few times a year maybe. these are my two closest relationships. 

my in-person interactions are not great. i??m terrible at talking to people. im awkward and stilted and serious. i don??t know what to say. literally, nothing at all comes to mind except quick one liners of small talk where i??m not even present in the conversation. i feel like a robot. i hate it. i don??t know if it??s social anxiety or what, but i literally cannot be comfortable around people who haven??t known me for a long time. i feel like i come off as aloof and unfriendly but really i??m just awkward and uncomfortable and quiet.

Since I was a kid, I always wanted to have those friends who cared for you but I never did. All I did was call people I kinda knew ""friends."" Thanks to my mom, I always knew someone but not enough that they actually cared about me. I only ever had one friend and that's the guy who I still hang out and talk to. I met another friend and now I have an overall of two friends that might maybe care if I left. During quarantine, I see people do video chats and have fun and talk with people but I haven't done that, only when I needed for my class. I should probably post this in my alt account but I gave up. My mom has always tried and I've tried to talk to her but she refuses so I guess she doesn't try. She may be trying to try but I guess she fails. My girlfriend, the only thing I basically have to live for, has stuff to do so we don't talk much. Even the people who I think MIGHT care about me don't even send me so much as a ""hi"" once a month. This whole quarantine, I've only talked to 5 people in dms and the rest don't even try. I hate ranting but I just needed to send this. I've never had anyone to share my shitty life with. I don't think I may have someone else apart from my girlfriend and even then, I don't want to burden her or spam her while she does more important stuff. I hate my irresponsible, sad, hateful, life but I don't want to die just yet. I just have to hold on to the fact that darkness is pure shit compared to this. At least I have Reddit to keep me at least going somewhat kinda.",1,"the narrative indicates the person feels isolated and disconnected from others despite having a few relationships. they express a deep sense of loneliness and lack of meaningful connections. their interactions are limited, and even those they consider close do not provide the emotional support they need. this persistent feeling of being alone and unimportant in others' lives suggests a profound sense of loneliness."

"Needed a place to ventI quit my job of two years not too long ago. It was a liquor store. Young crowd, a lot of fun. I was a hard worker and had a solid sense of humor so I thought I fitted in well there. 
 
I was good at the job, and was moving up. By far the owner??s favorite employee. 

I??m also an alcoholic who??s been diagnosed with clinical depression for some time. After a failed suicide attempt I knew I had to get back on my combination of anti-depressants. If any of you know much about those meds, you under NO circumstances can drink with them. 

So I quit, for the betterment of my mental health. I haven??t received ONE text message from the people I considered my closest friend group. The people I spent 40 hours a week for two years around. And it hurts, damnit it hurts like a mutha. 

I??m moved back in with my Dad, and I??m in between jobs. I could go work at McDonald??s, or a private security company, but I??d rather not go back to a minimum wage job. I??ve been applying left and right but I guess two years of booze slinging isn??t a selling point to employers.

If you made it this far thanks for reading. *fist bump*",1,the person is experiencing loneliness due to the lack of support and communication from their former colleagues whom they considered close friends. the transition from a familiar environment to living with their dad and being in between jobs adds to their sense of isolation and emotional pain
"I'm 23, finished my uni and yet I don't have a single friend. How do you deal with this? All those years and not a single person is interested in knowing if I'm alive or dead.

I don't have the energy to go out and start conversations either.Maybe I am the problem?",1,the person is lonely because they explicitly mention not having a single friend and feeling that no one is interested in their well-being. they also express a sense of hopelessness about their situation worsening with age and a lack of energy to initiate social interactions.
"Turned 30 years old a few months ago, only had one real relationship and it was so long ago.Doesn't help either that it was an abusive relationship and that she ended up committing suicide. Turned me into a wreck of a man for years.

I don't know what to do. I've never had anyone else since and I feel like I'll stay lonely 'til the end of my life. It hurts. I'm tired of coming back home and seeing an empty, dark and lonely place. 

Don't have any real friend either. I work, I get depressed because my work sucks and because I have a probably non-reciprocal love on a coworker and when I come back home I'm alone. All I can do to cope is drink.

Sometimes I go out alone, especially at night, in the juvenile hope that I'll somehow meet the love of my life outside but obviously I never did and never will.

I don't get what's wrong with me. I'm not that bad of a person. At least I think so.",1,"the individual is experiencing profound loneliness due to a combination of factors including a lack of meaningful relationships, the trauma of a past abusive relationship that ended tragically, and a sense of hopelessness about the future. their narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation both at home and in their social life, compounded by unfulfilling work and unreciprocated feelings for a coworker. the coping mechanism of drinking and the unsuccessful attempts to find companionship further highlight their loneliness."
"I have never been able to make friends. I have no one to talk to and I can't take it anymore.It may sound like I'm rambling, but please bear with me as I just need someone to talk to, and English is not my first language.

I'm 24 years old. In my childhood I was a prodigy. Marvelous in studies, topped my school for 12 grades in a row. But since my childhood I was never raised to be an outgoing, social person. So my social skills are extremely low. I have only my parents with whom I can share my feelings.

Due to my bad social skills, I have been bullied, mocked mercilessly by almost every one. I have never been able to make even a single friend. Every single time I fall for someone thinking of them as my friend, turns out they were just exploiting me and making fun of me behind my back. God knows how many times I've cried my eyes out to my parents regarding this, but they just come to their wit's end and just pray to God and cry along with me.

I somehow managed to get into a good college. But unfortunately I live in an overpopulated country with low infrastructure for career offers and paths. So the major factor deciding your career success is having excellent social skills and vast network so you can gather as much info as possible. I don't so I remained jobless for an year, while other students with very less marks than me managed to get into top companies.

Now I got into a small company and into a team which seamed nice at first. But I was apprehensive about opening up to them, due to my past experiences. They remained friendly to me, cracked jokes with me, called me to have lunch with them, and slowly my apprehension started lowering. I got hope that finally I was able to make friends. I'm not lie, I happy cried along with my parents about this.

On 2nd November was my birthday, so I gathered up enough courage to ask them to visit a popular place with me. Throughout that day, all of them were having fun amongst themselves, clicking pictures, etc while I felt like an outsider. I spent a TREMENDOUS amount of money at a popular restaurant all by myself as an effort for them to like me, maybe consider me as one of them.

What I found out next broke my heart into pieces. While I was under the assumption that we were all leaving for our homes after that outing, all of them were only pretending to leave for their homes. Instead they waited for me to leave, and after that went to a second place just for themselves to enjoy, and made fun of me the entire time. Moreover, all this time, they had a team whatsapp group that i didn't know about, mocking me about the things I opened up to them about, and they had been visiting various places and restaurants and whatever for the past few months, and I was the only one who didn't know about it.

One of those people's birthday is next week, and I suggested to visit this great amusement park. She said she'll be out of town that day, but I just found out that she was just lying to me, and is secretly planning a big party with all other team members. Even a person who left the team over a few months ago is invited, but not me 

I have been sitting in a separate room in the office for the past hour, crying like a baby. What did I do wrong? Why is God so cruel to me? I opened my heart to these people and this is the result. Memories of my whole past life that I have been trying hard to bury are flashing before my eyes.

I feel like a defective product coming from the factory being pushed into this world. I was not made to be in this society. But at my core, I am a human being too, and humans are social animals. When my parents die, I'll have ABSOLUTELY no one. All my life, whenever I have felt strongly about suicide, the thought of my parents immense sadness stops me. But guys, I can't take it anymore!

Anyone who reads this whole post, I sincerely thank you for taking time out of your life for a useless fool like me. I'm open to all suggestions. For now I just hope I can get through this day.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and despair. the individual describes a lifelong struggle with making friends and experiencing consistent bullying and rejection. despite attempts to connect with others, they feel continuously excluded and mocked. their social skills, shaped by a non-outgoing upbringing, contribute to their inability to form meaningful relationships. the loneliness is compounded by the fear of having no one after their parents pass away. this pervasive sense of being an outsider and the emotional pain they express indicate a profound loneliness."
"Lonely on my Birthday as alwaysMy birthday is on the 1. January and I'm afraid I will be lonely as always.
I am afraid of it, because I will probably act happy and amused but inside I'm lonely. I will probably get messages from people that never cared about me wishing me happy birthday. I don't have anyone to talk about. I thought  I'm getting better. But now at the end of the year Depression, Boredom, Loneliness is striking back. Harder then before. I always try to be positive, or at least give the appearance. 
I thought about just flying away. Buying a plane ticket and just flee from all of this. But this won't solve it. I'm to young. It breaks me. Piece by piece. I just thought about suicide. It seems easy, yet so hard. I can't anymore. Loneliness is ripping me apart. I don't know what to do. There is no escape. 
I'm suffering.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness which is evident through their expressions of feeling isolated on their birthday, their fear of being alone, and the struggle with depression and thoughts of suicide. they mention that messages from people who never cared about them only exacerbate their sense of loneliness, and they feel broken and unable to escape their suffering."
"Caught up in my head...I started smoking weed a couple weeks ago to give me something to do instead of mope, and it worked for a bit; it makes me all smiley and flowy. But I tonight I was smoking outside by myself leaning on the wall, and I got all caught up in my head... I closed my eyes, and imagined that I had a guy next to me all cuddled up into my side with his head nestled into my shoulder... shit felt so real that I leaned into it and fell on the floor lmao. I tried to do it again but couldn't replicate the feeling... it fell like fucking bliss man, I'd do anything to feel that way again, to feel loved, to feel like someone actually wants me by their side; even if it's fake and even if it's just for a few seconds...",1,the person is experiencing loneliness as they use weed to cope with their emotions and seek a sense of connection through imagined scenarios they express a deep longing for love and companionship which highlights their feelings of isolation and desire for human closeness
"I've (17 M) been feeling lonely and I really hate itI'm sorry if this is going to be long or not. I've always had a bad habit of drifting away of one topic to another one and so one. So I will try my best to stay on one topic. This will be a brief history of me to give you an idea of why I'm like this I guess.

I'm a 17 year old and I've been feeling lonely for some time. Unemployed, dropped out, and mentally unstable. I've had people I talked to in the past though. But only had one that I really considered a friend. I've had a really rough childhood. Alcoholic dad and slightly abusive mom. Never really got along with other kids considering I was fat. I developed insecurities at a really young age. I had a bit of hair on my legs at 3rd grade while others didn't. I had a deep voice at a young age too. Acne came early. I was depressed and anxious of what people thought. I had things other kids didn't have at that age. So obviously I was mostly lonely all throughout elementary. Bullied mentally and physically (never told anyone about the physical part) but you know I did my best to ignore. I managed. (Note: my dad went to jail when I was around 10 and my mom was a single mom working her ass off to provide for our family of 5 including me for years. Became less abusive. My 3 oldest brothers also moved out so it was just me, my sister, and my mom.)

Then (7th grade) middle school rolled in and obviously it got worse. I was skinnier though but kids still point out something to bully about me. I've already had insecurities to start with so I just wanted to run away from school to somewhere. Not home. Just somewhere away from everyone to cry and hit myself for being like this. But I couldn't. Didn't want to make it obvious that I was affected by them. So I did what I always have been doing and ignored. About fall in 7th I noticed facial hair. I didn't care though. I actually liked it lol. But around winter I noticed something off about my back. It was curved. I had scoliosis. Never really noticed. Didn't pay attention to sitting up straight. I hated it. I tried having good posture but it hurt to sit up straight (note. My scoliosis is worse). But I just gave up and continued with it I guess. January. I had a really bad bully. He was in most of my classes too. Embarrassed me in front of my crush. Gave me a really hard time. Harassed me. Made me lose my confidence even more. Whenever I had a good haircut or new clothes he always had something to say. But I still managed throughout the rest of 7th. I still managed.

Then 8th grade oh God. It was rough. Already fucking bullied straight off the bat. Scoliosis. Acne. Deep voice. Greasy face. Just everything at one hit me the first week of school. I couldn't handle it anymore. I just wanted to have someone to understand my situation. I fucking hated myself even more. I went home from school on Friday and cried in the bathroom (note. We had a 2 bedroom apartment so I shared a room with my mom while my brother shared one with our sister.). I came out after an hour and grabbed a knife and well... Started cutting my wrists and face. It hurt a lot but after sometime it took the pain away. Distracted me. I DON'T EVER CONDONE IT. Please don't EVER hurt yourself (Below I will provide a suicide hotline). And on Monday I went to school and people saw. Said it was a new cat problem. Can't believe they believed me. Either that or they just wanted a way to just not talk about it anymore. After that I stopped going. My whole mental health state just was at a all time low. Depression consumed me. Anxiety too. PTSD. A lot of things. Hurting myself even more. I went to a state mental hospital. didn't helped. And it was just a cycle. Started online dating at 14 because I had no luck in person and honestly... It was great. Although it wasn't physical I was happy for a moment. Sure they didn't see me in person but I showed them how I look and they still loved me. I gained confidence. Sending selfies, talking over the phone, video calling. They helped. But depression can really kill a person's mind and it got the best of me. You see I don't like telling people this but I'm bipolar. I have more depressive than manic. It was during my depressive moment. I just lost confidence. Thought she was gonna leave me and I started hurting myself again. Worse than before. Couldn't control it. Went back to the hospital for 2 weeks instead of a normal week stay. Still didn't help. As time went on she did break up with me. I regret what I said though. I said if she breaks up with me I'll kill myself. I was stupid. But obviously I didn't. And time passed by fast. I was unstable but I managed.

Turned 15. Still dropped out. Was more mentally stable due to medication. Realized my past actions and I started to kinda.... Help my mental state? I started finding coping skills. I had online friends I text a lot. Played games with. Fortnite, Black ops 2, etc. I went 6 months without hurting myself. Was proud. My mom was proud. Still depressed here and there with a bit of anxiety but medication helped. Then I stopped taking medication. Realized how lonely I was. And stopped. I don't know why. I thought that I didn't need them anymore. And for a time yeah I didn't. I didn't want to rely on a pill. And I helped myself become happier without them. But like I said my mom was a single mother. We were well.. homeless. For a time. My mom had friends though. Friends that provided a place to stay. A place as in one room. All of us in one room. I hated my mom's friend. He was immature and just overall mean. Mean as his actions. He had roomates. 3 bedroom apartment. 2 were taken by his roommates. It was during winter too. So when we would sleep in the room he would sleep in the car. Though I felt bad I was grateful. Still hated him though. Then he got tired of sleeping in the car. Understandable but he told us that we have to sleep in the car. So we did. One word: cold. I had a thick blanket but damn. Shivering all night. Couldn't sleep. we would put a blanket to cover the front car window because security would drive around. One time we got caught. And he went back to his apartment and he didn't open the door and we would just stay in the kitchen all night. Got depressed. But at times when my mom had enough money we would get a room at a hotel for a night. IT. WAS. THE. BEST. Warm, free WiFi, AND A SHOWER!!! I loved it. I would play fortnite with my online friend all night and I had a blast. My mom's friends room didn't have wifi. So we would walk to the library everyday and stay there for hours. (Note: didn't get wifi till recently lol) And my mom had another friend who would drive us to the hotel and back. One day my mom's friend told us we couldn't stay anymore I think. So my mom's friend who would drive us to the hotel got us a place to stay for a while. Again. A room. A strangers house. But warm. Grateful. No wifi though. Although it was a rough 6+ months we managed.

After some time we stayed at my mom's friend apartment (the one who gave us a ride). AND AGAIN A ROOM. But still was grateful. It was good. Wifi. Food. We were happy.  Had a girlfriend online. I was happy. And after some time we got kicked out (my mom's friend was renting the place though and the owner said that we gotta move out. Even my mom's friend.). LUCKILY he got a apartment. No room. Just an apartment for us 5. It's warm here. I like it. Wifi too. Lost my PS4 though cause when we would sleep in the car I kept my PS4 in the trunk but it got towed. Oh well I play on pc though. Low end PC but I got good games. But I still felt lonely. No friends. I'm bipolar and my online friends didn't like my depressive moments. I only have 1 online friend but I feel like I bother them. Had a breakup a few months back so a lot of people I text online stopped talking to me. Haven't been on social media in weeks. Nobody really texts me anymore. I find myself just playing videogames all day. And at night just YouTube. Quiet. I like to call myself a talkative introvert. Meaning that I hate socializing but I love talking lol. I feel uncomfortable socializing outside of home. I stutter, sweat, etc. Currently have non existent finger nails since I'm a nail biter when I'm nervous LOL. But yeah. I feel lonely. I've applied for 4 jobs but didn't get it. Applying for another one as of right now though. Still trying. I still have insecurities. Still have scoliosis. No acne though. Deep voice but I've grown into it. I have a gap between my two front teeth though. And I hate it. But with corona the masks covers it LOL. Although being lonely has its moments. When I get a haircut there's no one to criticize me. So I feel good. New clothes are the best too. Although I'm fat again I've been exercising a bit to get back in shape. But most of the time I just find myself doing the same thing over and over again. I sleep in the living room alone so it gets lonely. Really lonely. Although it's rough now I'm trying to help myself be better again. Applying for jobs, going outside more, etc. I'm 4 months clean from hurting myself too. So I'm happy about that. But I'm scared that depression will consume me again. Scared to be in my 20's, 30's, etc alone. No friends. No partner. I do pray to have a family though and a wife who will love me greatly. But who knows? I'm not rushing things now. They say having kids is a pain but hey I don't mind lol. Hate being lonely 80% of the time.

I'm sorry if this is long to read but I've never really told anyone my past in one take. Never really told anyone at all. If you've read everything thank you. It's nice to know someone's interested in my life &lt;3

P.S. I typed this after my mental breakdown lol. I didn't know where I wanted to go with this post but I just wanted to get everything out since I bottled up almost everything in my life. Thank you for reading :)

"I hate being aloneI talk to almost no one all day and when I do I feel like they don??t care about me, it??s hard to make friends because of covid. I??ve never had a girlfriend.

"Since I moved out I feel so lonely.So I moved out about 4 months ago with my gf. I feel like I am falling down a jealous pit of loneliness. Before I would just talk to her all the time but because of recent work schedules  we haven??t seem each other much. So my main source of socialization has gone. 

I have always been stuck to one or two really close friends for as long as I remember, but when we drop out of favor it always is devastating to me. I never seem to have a back up friend or a diverse pool of people to rely upon when I need it. 

Has any else ever experienced this and have any tips for getting out of this circle?",1,"the person is lonely because they express feelings of isolation after moving out and not seeing their girlfriend due to work schedules. they also mention a history of relying on a very small number of close friends, which exacerbates their loneliness when those relationships are strained. they lack a diverse social network to support them during these times."
"Not the best kind of friend to have.I used a lot of different subreddits to meet people. A lot of people came to talk to me and I thought I had made a lot of friends. But I'm not the greatest at conversation, so most of the people that wanted to talk to me just kind of...ghosted me. I'm not the greatest at talking. I have a hard time talking with other guys and when I talk to girls, I'm so socially deprived I end up catching feelings whem they're just trying to be nice to me. It's pretty gross, I know. I just don't really know what to do.",1,"the person feels lonely because they struggle with maintaining conversations and forming lasting friendships. they use online platforms to meet people but often end up being ghosted. they also have difficulty interacting with others, leading to feelings of social deprivation and unreciprocated emotional attachments."
"I feel like I'll never actually have friends because I'm a boring loserI used to like, sort of talk to people, back when I had to leave the house for school. Now.. I haven't had any friends in a year. Almost all my social interaction is arguing with my parents, or arguing with strangers online about video games. 

The thing is, I COULD try talking to people online, but that never works. I hate my voice, I hate smalltalk, I hate trying to make something work when the person I'm talking to is so blatantly shallow and boring. I find it really hard to relate to people, because I've never really had friends or any sort of interesting life experiences to talk about. I've tried making friends online before, none of them ever want to talk to me. So I stop talking to them.. and then I'm back to square one.

I hate TRYING to make friends. But I hate not having friends even more. I don't know what to do. So I just usually sit in my room and try not to cry lol. 

I don't want to hear any ""I'll be your friend"" I just want to know if anyone can relate to me",1,the person is lonely because they express a lack of meaningful social interactions and friendships they mention feeling disconnected from others and struggling to relate to people they also describe spending most of their time alone and feeling unhappy about their social situation

"4 years of unsuccessful attempt of trying to make friendsWell in real life I have always had friends who have been with me those are mostly the people I met in school or college they're all nice people and would have great time with them which is rare .
But somehow I don't know why I always feel alone like I have something missing inside me . Like I need someone with me online to text and talk to me online daily . That feeling of loneliness was always there . 
So year one I was on instagram I met this girl named called Nina we become really good friends we shared feelings had a good time . She was  there everyday we'd talk have nice time everyday I started distance relationship with her not knowing what I was getting into we dated hard for like year and a half then I eventually discovered she was cheating on me with someone first time she apologized and told me it was nothing she messed up asked me to stay so I did because I did loved her but it didn't work she cheated on me again few months in her friend told me she was sleeping with someone so I left her and hated myself for being an idiot and for believing that something like that would have worked . 
After that time I was ofcourse depressed and didn't wanted relationship because I felt betrayed and used . 
But me feeling alone and stress from real life pushed me look out someone this was the time I met many horrible people who just wanted to sext or needed something weird .
But finally after months of bullshit I met this lesbian girl amy . 
Amy is the best person I met online she was super nice and caring , she helped me with my stress she was there for me always . I never tried be more then more then a friend because she was gay and I respected that so I never tried I liked her as my best friend and I loved I had a such an amazing friend who was there for me .
We watched movies and shows with eachother we even had a list of things we'll watch and do together . 
But somethings changed and part of it was me too . Maybe I became to much for her to handle but I don't know why I did to her I support her alot when she felt alone missed her ex or was stressed about her life I was there for her. We started getting in fights we started having problems with eachother opinions on dumb things . 
She was being bossy all the time thought she was always correct and she hated when I told her that but it was true . I was pain in her ass too
Then I started noticing and she was avoiding me I asked her several times like let me fix things but she always said she is busy then she joined some discord groups where she made friends and it made me feel little lonely and I started acting jealous because she didn't talk to be in days even when I tried so hard . 
I was always nice to her but I needed things to be clear but whenever I tried she hated it she thought I was attacking her 
One day I tried to sort things out she just blocked me . More then year of friendship just gone and it didn't affect her at all I guess because I tried to reach her but she told me to stop . 

And I am alone again.... 
What did I need? Just a friend that's it .. but it just doesn't happen 
I always feel lonely now . I wish to get my friend back everyday I cry about it but I am lonely again . 4 Years and I'm still at zero . 
And im scared if anyone is gonna read it or does someone even give a shit about me I don't know .

"I miss soft conversations in bedIn the past I've dealt with some pretty intense pangs of loneliness, and in many ways have learned to enjoy life in spite of them. I've been in one relationship, and the thing I miss the most about it are the memories of laying in bed, just talking about things. We weren't compatible enough to be in a relationship forever, but those moments were the closest I've been to feeling romantically fulfilled.

It's almost funny, in a depressing sort of way, how our lives and dating rituals are so complex but our desires are *so simple*. I just want a close, intimate connection with a person. That's it. And yet I've spent years refining profile pictures, meeting at coffee shops, and worrying that the current person I'm interested in won't feel the same toward me, just like the last one.

I feel like I'm treading water alone in the ocean, and every potential romantic interest is just a passing piece of driftwood that rapidly deteriorates. It's exhausting trying to keep up the effort to stay afloat, especially with how long it takes for the next one to appear.

Right now, I feel particularly lonely because I think it's happening again. The person I really think I click with has, for reasons unbeknownst to me, decided they aren't interested. Every time someone ghosts me, I can't stop myself from trying to piece together what I did wrong, if any. I get that sometimes there just isn't a spark, but this time that makes *zero* sense.

I work from home (so no work friends) and I moved to this new city to be with him (so no existing friends). Luckily my sister and cousin live nearby so I see them once a week or once every other week. 

It??s been several months since I moved here and things are getting kind of stressed at home. I think my boyfriend fell in love with me when I was vibrant and fun and had friends around, but now he??s sick of me because I??m an introvert at home all the time and have no social life.

"I wish I had someone, but now meeting new people in real life seems impossible.This is quite long, so only read if you have time. I'm posting it here just to check whether someone has gone through similar experiences.

Reminiscing my life so far, I have always been lonely since my childhood. I don't have any siblings, which made it worse. The only friend I had was my neighbor but due to some issues between the families we stopped talking at the age of 6 and then reunited again at age of 10. Later, I made two more friends in 2015 and 2017. That's it. I have only befriended three people in 19 years.

Girls have always hated me for no reason and talked to me rudely. I can't blame them because I am very introverted and I never talked a lot back in school. However, a girl befriended me in kindergarten and the friendship lasted till second grade. She was the only friend I made in school till that point of time. I have acquainted a lot of people since then, but nobody really wanted to be friends with me. People that I thought were friends didn't even care about me in the end. I am a background character in people's lives who they can approach when they have no one to talk to or need some help.

In 2017, I approached a girl in high school for the first time in my entire life hoping to spark a friendship. I managed to get her phone number after a first few interactions. We used to chat everyday but she never wanted to spend time with me in real life as she wanted to attend lectures. Eight months later, she started ignoring my messages, started replying late and even started bunking classes. I soon realized that she got into a relationship with a guy from another class whom she met only three weeks ago. I never messaged her again. After graduating from high school she messaged me and even called me thrice asking me whether I had ""forgotten"" her. I blocked her everywhere and never heard from her again. The guy must have dumped her.

I befriended a girl again in college (2018). This was unexpected because all I did was solve her doubts regarding academics a few times. And then we developed a virtual friendship gradually. But in the end, the same thing happened. She started ignoring me soon. She was already in a relationship, so that wasn't the problem for me. Just like the other girl, she never wanted to spend time with me yet had time to hangout and flirt with other guys. I ended the friendship by telling her how she mistreated me. I was basically just a substitute for other people.

The fact that I don't have any friends who care for me the way I do hurts. Although I consider myself lucky that I have people whom I can call friends, the fact that I'm not a priority for any of them hurts. They are there to support me, but I feel that they're just sympathizing with me.

I have never had any type of meaningful interactions with women all my life. The conversations usually only last for 20-30 seconds. Girls have turned me down even for friendship. I have been blocked just for sending ""Hi"" to a classmate. I wonder what's wrong with me, because I look pretty average and I can talk confidently enough with people but nobody ever seems to be interested in getting to know me. I wonder how people around me get in and out of relationships so quickly.

At this point, I really crave for a strong emotional and physical connection with someone but I can't do anything about it. Every girl I come across is already in a relationship. Most of my acquaintances are in a relationship?? or at least are close friends with females. After having so many bad experiences with girls, I don't trust anyone anymore. Even if a girl is interested in me at some point of time, I won't be able to pick any hints. If I get into a relationship, I will perhaps be a terrible partner as I absolutely have no idea of what women like. I can't spend money to make her happy by buying gifts or flowers. I feel like a total failure in life. I have tried to cope with my loneliness developing a lot of hobbies and that has helped me in the long term, but in the end, being lonely is just devastating.

I won't even need a lot of friends if I had a person who will love me to the core, someone I can tell everything about and vice versa. But it just seems impossible at this point of time. Now you'll probably tell me that I'm just 19 and I have a long life ahead, but as the years pass by the probability of meeting new people is decreasing as well. I'm in college now and the class won't shuffle till the final year. None of my friends will introduce me to their friends and I will probably become a freelancer in future so I don't have any chances of making new friends (both male and female) or getting into a relationship. Now I'm apprehensive to even approach people because I can't bear to see all my effort and time that I have spent go waste for people who don't give a shit about me. I'm sure I'm not the only one to experience this, but I have lost all my hope.",1,"the narrative clearly shows a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections. the person describes a history of limited friendships, failed attempts at forming relationships, and a consistent feeling of being a background character in others' lives. the experiences with both male and female acquaintances reinforce their sense of loneliness and lack of belonging. despite efforts to cope through hobbies, the overwhelming sentiment is one of despair and hopelessness about forming future connections. this strongly indicates a lonely individual."
"Want someone to text withI'm 27 and currently a stay at home mom to a 5 year old starting kindergarten soon. I moved to a small town where I don't know anybody and the pandemic as well as fires have me feeling pretty isolated. I love reading, movies, music, horror/Halloween, Doctor Who, food, hiking, and art.  Hit me up of you want to chat!",1,the person feels isolated due to moving to a small town where they do not know anyone and the pandemic and fires have exacerbated this feeling they are seeking companionship and connection through texting indicating loneliness
"What's your worst experience being lonely?I just a few months old realized that I have a social anxiety and the fact that it has caused me really poor performance at school and building network for my future. I have a really cold relationship with my dormitory mates, and I'm sure they all think I'm weird. 

Since corona, I count I cry at least once every month out of loneliness. The first few months of 2020 were even worse, as I cried every week (but that also because I had depression). I talk everyday to myself, in front of the mirror, or in front of my stuffy animal. Many times I pretend to have a call with an imaginary someone to avoid talking to my dorm mates in the common room. When my loneliness peaks, often I feel physically cold that I shiver. Every night before I sleep, I always fantasize about having someone I can come home to, whom I can hug and talk with - and believe me, that's the best time of the day for me. I like to sit by my window every evening on my bean bag, watching anyone passing by the road and even listening to their conversation - just so that I feel some human exposure. I cried two or three times while eating my dinner on my desk because I never share a meal with anyone since I came to this town. I always feel self-conscious when I shop at the supermarket or when I walk around the park, because I feel people stare at me with pity because I look like a loner. I ate alone in the cafeteria three times, to which on the third time my classmates caught me and I was deeply embarrassed because they knew how lonely I was - so I stopped eating there ever since.",1,"the person is experiencing significant loneliness as indicated by their narrative. they mention social anxiety, poor performance at school, and difficulty building relationships. they have cold relationships with dorm mates and cry frequently due to loneliness. they talk to themselves or pretend to have phone calls to avoid interaction, and they fantasize about having someone to come home to. they also feel self-conscious in public and have stopped eating in the cafeteria due to embarrassment. all these behaviors and feelings are clear indicators of loneliness."
~IDK~I am not feeling ok right now. I just wish I could be in a loving environment. I just feel like I can??t talk to anyone. I don??t feel like eating. But I am fine. Sorry that I am being a Debby downer. Sorry... I will probably delete this later anyway.,1,"the person expresses a desire for a loving environment and feels unable to communicate with anyone. these sentiments suggest feelings of isolation and loneliness. the narrative also indicates a lack of appetite and self-deprecation, further supporting the sense of loneliness."

"Now allowed anything in lifeI only have to go out to a supermarket or busy store to be reminded I'm not allowed anything in life. I'm likely older than most you here, 31 but I spent my entire life isolated. I'm not allowed work, friends, relationship.",1,"the person describes a life of isolation and lack of social connections. they mention being older and having spent their entire life without work, friends, or a relationship. this indicates feelings of loneliness and social deprivation."

"Best friend of 9 years just ??broke up?? with me??So I am a senior nursing major in college, most of my high school friendships have faded out and I go to a private Christian school where I don??t fit in and it??s hard to make friends, on top of that I??m super busy with school and work, and so is everyone else.

Today I reached out to my best friend from middle school, she is the only one from my hometown that hasn??t faded out?? she was super dry with me so I asked what was up.

A little about me. I am 26 years old. I live in the US, and would prefer it if you did too just because of the whole time zone thing. I have some mental health issues I deal with on a day to day basis. So if that is a problem.. uh sorry not sorry.

I enjoy playing games, (I play on PS4, but don't really have many games. I play Fortnite, Rocket League, Apex, (I am trash at all) and a few others I can't really think of right now.) listening to music, some photography, corny jokes, TACOS, and anything horror or conspiracy related.

I won't go into too much more detail because then there is nothing to talk about. I have discord if it easier to switch to that to chat and I prefer to chat on there to be honest. I also have a cringy tiktok where I have made some of my own videos.

"People say improving oneself is the key to happiness but i guess not for me.I agree, maybe for some people but unfortunately not for me. Only had one relationship in my life and it ended badly with me having anxiety and trust issues. What did people say? Try improving yourself. So i did, worked out to the point that peers and friends were surprised that i had muscles showing, talked to a lot of people despite being introverted, had lots of hobbies. I did everything I could to improve. Unfortunately, its still the same. My crippling loneliness is eating me away everyday. My fear of being the only one interested and doing my best is constantly showing. Every women i talk to is not interested and thats fine, they have preferences. Even trying to focus on myself is not paying off. I just want to be loved, be hugged, be with someone who will love me but its not happening no matter how hard I try. Its mentally draining, learning to be alone is hard, constant pressure of being the eldest brother of my family is hard. College is hard. I would love to end it all but I can't leave my parents behind. I envy people with happy relationships but envying wont lead to anywhere. The only way i can experience that happiness is only through my dreams.",1,the person is clearly experiencing profound loneliness as indicated by their narrative they describe a deep sense of isolation despite their efforts to improve themselves they mention a lack of fulfilling relationships and a strong desire for companionship and love their feelings of mental exhaustion and envy of others in happy relationships further underscore their loneliness
"Hi, you can call me Mr.LonelyFor the past few months I have been feeling something wrong going on in my life, it felt so tasteless, school been so boring and annoying, and work feels even worse. Even when I got my paycheck I was like ""meh :|"", basically because half of it goes to the uni and the other half I live by.
I took a vacation with my friend and a group of students, had some fun, only to come back home, waking up the next morning feeling the exact same.
Yesterday I probably did an average of 3 visits to the fridge each hour in order to find something to put in my mouth and spend some of my time chewing it.
I tried to read books, gave up in the first few pages, tried to take a walk, felt so sleepy and came back home, even riding my bike doesn't feel as fun as usually.
On Instagram I went to the search page, went to a post, and scrolled all the way down to the last suggested post, I didn't even know that page has an end. I close each YouTube video after few minutes for that it's not filling me with whatever I feel I want. And I also liked each possible post on Facebook, I even spent some time scrolling through the ADs.
I don't know man, there seem nothing to make me feel.. I don't even know what I want to feel, but I'm quite sure I don't want to feel like this, I feel so lonely and isolated from everything..

"Lonely for 2+ yearsHi everyone. I don't know what this post is, maybe I just need to have this off my chest.

I have been lonely for two and a half years, and it's taking a toll on my mind, because I am struggling with the conversation and understanding others. It hurts me to always have to contact people first, yet I see the same people calling others first. And when I say I feel lonely they are like - oh, you know, we all don't have time - but that's a lie - I see them having a plenty of time for others. It's not like I can't make friends or that people dislike me - seems like the opposite, but I don't know why everyone acts like I don't exist, even if I am trying. For all this time, for only 4 days someone gave me a minute of their attention, for all this two and a half years. It feels especially horrible, because, for almost all this time I have been severely sick - daily pains all over my body, and I lie in the bed for a long time because I am tired, having headaches, and so on... And they know it: when I call them I am always sick and laying, still, not even a one support message. It hurts - sometimes I have thoughts of sending them a message how they hurt me neglecting my existence, and telling them to erase my number because I will erase theirs, and I don't act out because there's one hairline of hope it will be better; but it never does.

I am not seeking to make friends here, but I would love if someone answered me: how do you battle with this?",1,"the person feels isolated and neglected despite their efforts to reach out. they express a deep sense of loneliness and frustration over being ignored by those they consider friends, especially during a period of severe illness. their narrative is filled with pain and a longing for connection, which indicates they are indeed experiencing loneliness."

My current job is fun and to a degree I really enjoy it, however even after being there a year in August I can't shake the feeling none of my colleagues actually want me there. I've had cold shoulders and small chat when I try to talk to people, yet people who were hired at the same time as me seem to be everyone's favourites, and I dont know why.

So much so as a till colleague in a big store occasionally we have to call using our headsets to other colleagues (Such as getting furniture out the warehouse, grabbing a barcode, calling for till colleagues, seeing what we have in stock etc) when they do it usually 3-4 colleagues lap at them to help, yet when I ask something simple such as can we have some till colleagues I get shit back, usually saying do it yourself or just ignored completely, even my manager gives me shit when lines build up and I've called 4 times yet when he calls suddenly 8 people turn up. I'm sick of it.

It doesn't help three particular colleagues I have to buddy up with (We joined their store as extra staff while our new store got pushed back) I've seen talk shit behind my back, even saying I'm hopeless and I'm doing things wrong (When in reality I'm doing it by the books), I've had two of them try convince me prior because I was rather tired working with Rugs/Carpets for 8 hours straight that I should look for something else. 

One day I just think I'm going to lose it give my notice on my bosses desk and just wait out my last two weeks, I'm sick of how I'm treated like ass. I just want to come to work and feel like I matter and I'm respected, not mocked and ignored.

"Another Valentine??s Day postI know they??re everywhere today but I want to post mine to get it off my chest. Today sucks massively. All day walking around school seeing all the couples doing their thing, good for them. All the little stalls selling their V-day snacks, treats, and gifts, cool.

Now usually I get home, head up the stairs and as soon as I shut my bedroom door I feel at peace. I can be alone with myself which is often where I??m happiest. Not tonight tho. Tonight I heads up the stairs, shut the bedroom door, left the lights off, collapsed on my bed and burst into tears. 

Why? I wanted a hug. Just a hug, someone to wrap their arms around me and say it was going to be okay. But there??s no one to hug, so I??ll fall asleep hugging my pillow instead.

August 2016 - I move to Spain to study abroad for a year. Everything's going great, making loads of cool new friends and having a pretty good social life. I've always been a weed smoker but it was just easier to get over there so a once-in-a-while habit turned into a can't-live-without-it kind of thing. I'd literally stay in my room from whatever time I woke up until whatever time I fell back asleep just smoking. I think I just liked how it made me feel like.. not a person. Anyway as you can probably guess this fucked me up mentally. This destructive behaviour culminated in me getting a bad case of food poisoning and ending up in the hospital. In Spain. Alone. Attempted suicide. Next day, I called my mum and told her everything, and she flew out to come and get me. What a legend. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 2017 - Back home, lowest point of my life. Crying every day for no reason, completely isolating myself. Sometimes I'd be completely catatonic. Like, I could hear my mum's voice but something in my head told me not to move or make a sound. Kind of scary actually. After a few months of medication I finally start feeling better. Decide to get a job at a local bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

August 2017 - Life is finally getting back on track! You know why? Because I have my first ever boyfriend! He's funny and... actually, he was just funny. I didn't see it like that at the time but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. As the human brain is wont to do, I start convincing myself that this boyfriend is the reason I got better. Of course he was! It totally wasn't my already-fucked-up-brain making arbitrary associations! Obviously! Anyway, I was getting better and it was (apparently) all because of him. I convinced myself that what we had was love. Yeah, he'd make me have sex when I didn't want to, and yeah, he'd belittle me and make nasty jokes about my body to our coworkers, but he said that was love and who was I to argue?! 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2017 - He raped me. He then told everyone we worked with that I'd made up a story about him raping me and not to believe it. He also told everyone about the suicide attempt. Who would believe the crazy girl, right?! I quit.

&amp;#x200B;

November 2017 - Finishing my last year of University. 10th best University in the world. Not a brag, just a lot of fucking pressure. I stop talking to friends. Even when they reached out to me, I couldn't bring myself to reply. They all eventually drop off the radar. My fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018 - At least I graduated, right?! Not a terrible GPA, not a great one. But I did it! I have a degree! Now what?

&amp;#x200B;

June 2019 - I've been unemployed since September. I've got a great degree, but no friends, no job and no money. I live at home with my parents and my cat. I don't talk to anyone. I stay in bed all day and watch youtube videos. I'm trying to come to terms with all of this but I honestly don't know how. I can't even get an entry level admin job because I have no experience. I speak four languages and have an IQ of 129. What the fuck is the point of all of that if I can't afford to do an unpaid internship? You need experience to get a job but you need to get a job to get experience. Fucking A.

So that's my story. I know, I know, there are people that are dying. I just felt like I needed to blurt this all out. Sorry",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness and isolation. the person describes a lack of human interaction, a series of traumatic experiences, and a progressive withdrawal from social connections. they also mention being unemployed, living with their parents, and not talking to anyone, all of which are indicators of loneliness. the tone throughout the narrative is one of desperation and sadness, further supporting this."
"4 days alone.I last worked 4 days ago, I used some paid time off on-top of my already scheduled days off to have a little break. In those 4 days no one has messaged me at all. Noone checked if I was doing well, or even just to say hi.
I understand alot of people go more than 4 days without talking to people, I have at times aswell. 

The people who could've reached out to me in those 4 days are my co workers, they are my ""friends"". Superficial, if even that. Noticing that, I see how insignificant I am to them, the fact that they only interact with me at work (if they do) makes me realize these 4 days aren't just that. My life has always been that way.",1,"the person is lonely because they describe feeling insignificant and disconnected from others. they mention that no one reached out to them during their time off, and they reflect on how their relationships are superficial and limited to work interactions. they also express a sense of isolation and a long-standing pattern of feeling this way."
"I want to be someone's ""favorite.""I want to mean something to someone. To *really* mean something to someone. Not out of obligation or because I happen to be related to them. And not because they're paid to talk to me, as is the case with therapists. I want to be loved for who I am. Nothing less, nothing more.

I'm always that person who's just kind of ""there."" Most see me as simply ""the quiet girl."" Others see me as someone who is nice but awkward. They may enjoy my company when no one else is around, but otherwise I'm pretty forgettable to them.

I envy people with partners who think they're absolutely amazing. And I envy people who have a non-one-sided best friend. How do others find that level of closeness with someone? It's such a foreign concept to me.

Even with people I *think* I'm close with, I'll later learn that we really weren't that close. For this reason, I have to be cautious when getting to know new people. It's painful to realize that someone meant more to you than you did to them.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep desire for meaningful connections and a sense of belonging. the person expresses feelings of being overlooked and undervalued by others, which contributes to their loneliness. they crave genuine affection and recognition, indicating a lack of fulfilling relationships in their life. the envy of others with close bonds further underscores their isolation and longing for companionship."

While I feel like I should just move on from her since she clearly doesn??t like me anymore, she??s the only person I really can talk to at this point so I don??t want to just stop talking to her out right. This has been going on for months now and I feel like the longer this goes on the worse my mental health gets. I just don??t know what to do anymore.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness because they rely heavily on their best friend for social interaction and support. the friend's lack of communication is causing significant emotional distress and a sense of isolation, indicating that they do not have other meaningful connections to turn to."
"i feel like there??s something inherently wrong with meit??s been this way my whole life, i got diagnosed with depression at 11 but i knew i was depressed before that i just didn??t have a word for it. i have a ton of familiar and sexual trauma that stops me from having a good relationship with my family or a decent romantic relationship. i try to keep depression or any of my feelings out of platonic ones because i??m afraid of people knowing that much about me. i??ve tried finding internet friends, not to just vent to but to have someone i actually feel cares and wouldn??t use it against me. but nothing i try works, people fuck me over or ghost me before we ever get to become good friends. i don??t have anyone even myself. i feel alone even when i??m not.",1,"the narrative indicates profound feelings of isolation and disconnection from others. the person struggles with depression, trauma, and a lack of meaningful relationships, both familial and romantic. their attempts to form connections, even online, have been unsuccessful, leading to a sense of being alone even in the presence of others. this suggests a deep sense of loneliness."

"Just wanted to say this, maybe I'll feel better.These last few days I feel down, I have no motivation to do anything. I struggle every day with myself. I feel useless, ugly, stupid... The only one that made my life bearable was my cat but he died suddenly a while ago now I'm left with no one.

I have everything yet I feel nothing.

It makes me feel like I'm not capable of doing things I should and that in lazy and useless. I have tried making conversations with people and stuff but I can't make people want to talk to me again.

It's an erie night in September, and the protagonist results back to old habbits in order keep her perpetual fear of loneliness at bay. Not yet possesed by the engulfing howls of winter, she searched for a source of warmth. She participates in what she now knows is an unhealthy habbit of ghost hunting. On that night she reaches out to a soul whom she believes mirror hers. A message is sent and, to her surprise, he responds. There's a bit of a delay, but thats to be expected. He's from another world and has the accent to prove it. She thought she summoned *the one*. You know, the one that would enter her world and make her real. It's been forever since her skins been touched. Her heart? An unpenetratable, depsite the gaping hole. What she hoped to accomplish with this new link was simple. Never has she ever fallin so deep to the sound of someones voice. When he spoke it was clear, audible, vocal. She wished for him to voice her name, for it to echo through her tunnels (rendered deeper with each failed attempt to make contact with the other side), summoning her. For a momment she believed she had nailed the ritual. She began the exchange by trading sight for sound. Enlighted by the flash from her camera she highlighed her body, all her flaws on display. ""Your perfect"" he insisted. So she persisted. Hed drop an octive or two untill his voice reached a growl. Shed almost forgotten his true nature. You see before climax could be reached the connection was dropped. The piercing silence that followed hollowed her. Her lover boy was not a lover or a boy. In fact, he was never really there. What she experience was not a dream, but a fantasy. She wished for love the way a kid wishes for candy or a dog fo a bone. Though they never touched, he was quite handsy, came, became person unkonwn. Where he went or why hed gone shed never know. All I can tell you is he dried up like the desert, she blowed up, went bezzerk. Ghost hunting took up the rest of the night. She raked through the graveyard in search for a bone. She attempted to read every tomestone?? too, but her dyslexia got in the way. She still wanted him to say her name. She didnt know her destiny untill he spelled it out for her. No matter how she twisted and turned her body for him (and the other hims) she could not escape her destiny.

When you??re alone, with nothing but your thoughts at night and no one to tell you they love you, or how much you mean to them, it hurts too much.

I can??t date, I can??t effortlessly talk to people especially girls, they can sense I??m insecure, unsure of myself and depressed, it??s written all over my body language and demeanour, I think I??ll die alone and never know how it feels like to fall in love.",1,the person feels disconnected and struggles with social interactions. they express feelings of being left behind socially and emphasize their lack of romantic companionship. their narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections.
"Cannot fit inI normally think of myself as a Ok guy, not overly annoying, not a dick and average looking, but for the life of me I cannot fit in no matter what I do how I act or who it??s with, I grew up having a 3 really good friends, 2 moved and I lost contact with, and the other one stopped wanting to be a friend with me and ditched me for my brother. So I tried making new friends, so I hung out with some of my brothers friends. I thought we were good, until I realized that the only reason I did anything with them was because of my brother, so I suffered for a few years, having ??aqantences??, but I was never anyone??s first pick, he??ll I wasn??t their 2nd, 3rd or even picks 4-50, not once was Invited to a party or bonfire or even just to hangout. Then I tried to become friends with some kids in the grade beneath me, and I thought it was going very well, but then after practice one day, I heard them talking about going out to eat with each other, I wasn??t asked to go and they probably didn??t consider asking to go. Now I don??t know what to do, my messages have not had a notification in forever, I hav t been invited to anything since my brother graduated, at this point I don??t care if it??s fake, I just want someone to talk to, I see these people being happy with girlfriends or friends in general, I don??t even know anyone well enough to talk to them and explain how I feel. I dont even feel comfortable talking to my parents about it because their convinced im invited to a lot when I??m not. What did I do to deserve this, I??m not asking to be mr popular, but why, why can??t I just be happy for more than 10 minutes, I??m tired of this life and just want to end it, but I can??t because I  don??t want to upset my parents, I can??t stop thinking about it even though it??s breaking my mind apart, I??m so lost in my head I??m stuck, I cannot do this much longer.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness, as they describe a persistent inability to form meaningful connections despite their efforts. they feel excluded and uninvited to social events, leading to feelings of worthlessness and isolation. their struggle is compounded by a lack of support and understanding from their family, which deepens their sense of being misunderstood and alone."

"Justifiable Loneliness and ConfusionHi all. I hope you are all having an amazing start to your new year.

I am a F18 having a little trouble coping with my loneliness from this past year and for a while it was able to go away and I was content with myself but every now and then it creeps up on me in overwhelming power. I crumble down immediately. I loose sense of perspective in all aspects of my life. I truly feel as if there is no one I can talk to because no one understands my sense of worthlessness to the people around me. 

I also have this problem where I feel my loneliness is unjustifiable because I am stable in all aspects of my life . I go to a great university, my family is all healthy, Im financially stable, yet I still feel as if I am not good enough for the world around me. 

Throughout high school I always had friends, but I never considered any of them the so called ""best friends"" I never understood that someone other than a family member could be that close to me until college where I now feel like I have made genuine friendships. Even though I have found and made some genuine friendships in college, I still feel like I am inadequate and undeserving of those friendships. I am scared that those people mean more to me than I mean to them. Over this winter break I can't help but feel as if I am just a nobody that no one prioritizes or values.

I am sitting here ringing in the new years with my so called high school ""friends"" ditching me and not inviting me to hang out with them, many I have not seen for months, and my college friends being much more accepted and validated in their home towns. I do not know where I stand in the world, I do not believe anyone values me more than just a speck of dust. But I am also confused as if my loneliness and confusion on my self value is even justified in the first place. I do not know what  I am asking for out of you guys, I just know I need answers.

Here is to 2019 being a lot kinder to all of us.

"I hate being sadI'm going to start off by telling youse I'm a male, 16 and an introvert and I don't really like being around a large amount of people and it's hard for me to make friends let alone actually talk to someone I don't know irl. When I'm at school I always feel like people are talking about me although they most likely aren't and sometimes I get my words mixed around which is very annoying when I'm reading out loud. Anyways I officially have no real life friends. I have 20 friends on my PS4 but I only play with one of them a lot besides my older brother. I'm being honest when I say my online friends have given me more friendship than my real ones. I messaged one of my real friends last week just saying ""how are you going?"" And he just left me on read, I try messaging others and they just leave me on read. When I message an online friend they will respond within 3 minutes (that's if they're not busy or sleeping). I'm not talking to my "" real friends"" anymore because I had a lot of time with my own thoughts and realised I'm like a background character in my small group at school. They plan dinners and going to the movies but I'm never told about it until after they have done it. Now I don't mind sitting alone at school but when I'm home it just makes me sad. I can't even focus at school well because I can't pay attention in class, not that I don't want to it's just that I get distracted fast. I'm probably just going to go mute at school now. 

Sorry if this looks like in asking for pity or if this makes no damn sense but I haven't cried for years and all of a sudden the little things are hurting me to the point where I start getting horrible thoughts. I think I just need a friend who has things in common with me.

"I honestly wish I could have the mindset of a recluse and not feel the need for social interaction.I am a contradictory loner.

I ache for making human connections, yet I??m beginning to suspect I am asocial. It??s very conflicting to feel like I??m all alone yet I have very little desire to create or maintain interpersonal relationships with anyone.

I have my wife and daughter and they are all that keep me sane. Other than coworkers; they are the only two people in my life.

I wish I could be more like this [guy.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Thomas_Knight) I sometimes imagine me living my life similarly if not for having a wife a daughter.",1,"the person is lonely because they express a desire for human connections but feel conflicted about their ability to create or maintain relationships. they mention feeling alone despite having a wife and daughter, indicating a deeper sense of isolation. the limited social circle, consisting only of family and coworkers, further suggests a lack of broader social support."

"What??s wrong with meHonestly I??m an okay looking guy, I had girls literally doing the most so I can talk to them and me I just don??t know how to act I??m really shy really bad anxiety.. I see everyone in a group talking and I??m just left out due to people thinking I??m rude .. but in reality I have so much anxiety it??s driving me insane honestly I lost so many chances at friendships and relationships w girls .. I??m so tired I just want to sleep forever :/",1,"the person expresses feelings of being left out and misunderstood due to their anxiety and shyness. they mention losing many chances at friendships and relationships, indicating a sense of isolation and loneliness. the narrative shows a deep frustration and sadness about their social situation, reinforcing their loneliness."
"I Feel Like Nobody Wants to Talk or Listen to MeI only have a few people I consider friends. And I??m pretty lucky to have them, I??ve known them for a while and they??re definite not fake friends. So I don??t know why nobody including them ever tries to talk with me.

I never get any messages just asking what??s up, and most days if I don??t try to talk to someone, then I??m not talking to anyone that day. I don??t know how long I??d be able to just be a hermit before someone asks where I??ve been, but it??s a thought I have that makes me kinda sad considering I could just be missing and I don??t think they??d notice.

Then there??s the issue with when I try to talk to people. I really don??t think anybody cares. I??ll be with people and everyone??s just talking, but any time I say something either the conversation dies or I get interrupted. The latter has been happening for so long that I just shut up when it does happen without even thinking about it. After a few times I??ll realize what??s going on and start to try and notice if it??s happening to anyone else there. Usually it??s not.

So often I find myself wanting to tell someone about something only to pour over all the people I know and think?? They don??t care. Why would they? They never cared before. Or I feel like what I have to say is too weird and would be awkward to bring up to them.

I like talking with new people, because a lot of the time they??re kind and will ask me something and actually try to listen, but I??m pretty shy so I have a hard time actually making a connection with them.

I guess I just want to note that I don??t want people questioning my friendships. If it was as simple as what I said here then no I wouldn??t be friends with them, but there are so many more reasons why I am. This is just the one thing that really makes me feel lonely sometimes.",1,"the narrative expresses feelings of being ignored and undervalued by friends and others, despite the narrator having some friends. they feel isolated because their attempts to communicate are often met with indifference or interruption. they struggle to connect with new people due to shyness, which exacerbates their sense of loneliness. these feelings and experiences align with the classification."
"Im out of a relationship and im just plain lonely.I recently got out of a 4 year relationship and decided to try to do things that would make me happy. I was hoping making friends would be one of them but honestly, im lonlier now than ever. My ex and I are still good friends but since we broke up, shes made more friends now than ever and hangs out with them often. Meanwhile, I have a hard time even getting old friends to text me back. No new friends and barely any old friends. I try not to think about it and try to focus on myself but I always have the thought: ""this would be fun with a friend"" or ""man im bored. I should try to hang out with some friends"" but it never happens. Ive always been kind of a quiet person. I guess this is the drawback. At this point, I just spend a lot of time alone at the house or at the bar when im not at work. I just dont know what to do anymore. Being lonely isnt eating at me or anything. It just makes me really sad. Like i have nobody.",1,"the person is experiencing significant loneliness after a breakup. they mention feeling lonelier than ever and having difficulty making new friends or reconnecting with old ones. they spend a lot of time alone and express sadness about their situation, indicating a deep sense of isolation and loneliness"

He seems to have friends judging from facebook but yeah its facebook so I dont put too much value on that. For the past few years I have been wondering like what the hell, should I just send him a message? I am afraid I guess of what might happen or that he wants nothing to do with me. We were going through puberty and it was a time for me when I had huge anxiety about everything and made poor decisions. From my side, I am completely on good terms with the guy.

I've been doing some exercise regularly for over six months, started kick boxing this year too. Also swimming. I'm still not ripped lol, but slowly building muscle. Last week I also applied to start a 2 year accounting course so I can get a better job. 

But like I'm stuck a bit. I don't really know what to do to get out. I've never done it. I was happy gaming and now I'm not. But I have anxiety so doing anything alone is nerve wracking.

I don't know where to start this. Well. I could say I miss having friends. Having people with whom I could just talk. Just vent and just you know... Socially interact with. I wish I wasn't lonely. Well, the times where I had friends is over i guess. It doesn't really matter much.

I also wanted to say that I regret not being here to help lately. I should go through posts and offer my help more often i know. Well. Consider this a helping point. Let me ask you something: how are you? How have you been? And of course i am here if you need to talk. I'm going nowhere.

"Sad birthdayI moved away for medical school to a different country and it??s been hard dealing with that in itself. I miss my friends, my family, my relationship didn??t survive the distance (other problems too). Mostly I just miss being home and surrounded by familiar things/places/people. 

Yesterday was my birthday, and we had a huge exam. For weeks my friends have been talking about how we??re going to go out after and celebrate. We always go out after exams so I figured it??d be the usual, plus a cupcake or fancy shot. The other day I went to the post office to pick up a present my mom had sent, and went back to school with puffy eyes from crying. My friends called me out and I told them how I was homesick and this is my first birthday without the people I??ve known my whole life. They assured me we??d have a great time after the exam to cheer me up. One of my friends is our class social chair (just tells ppl where we??re drinking after exams) and she said she??d pick a chill but fun place to go. I asked her Saturday night what the plan was and she said she??s between a couple places but would let me know before everyone else, cool. It was her own birthday about a week ago and we all sacrificed a night of studying to go into the city for a pricey dinner, so I know she takes birthdays seriously.

Well I get to school before the exam, don??t see them and no texts but exams in an hour, I wouldn??t be wishing anyone a hbd either. Exam ends. I wait in the group study room where their book bags are for half an hour, thinking they??d finished earlier and went to get coffee or something. No texts, no hbd or ??hey we??ll be right back??. I leave to buy some champagne and clean up my apartment, thinking I??d host a little pregame tn. One friend texts to ask how we can submit our histology assignment... nothing else.

At this point I was just sad and moping, figured I didn??t want to go out anyways since I didn??t sleep last night. I don??t like confrontation or attention so I wasn??t going to say anything either. I just took a nap, figured some plans would be made by the time I woke up. I wake up to pictures of my friends with other classmates out for drinks and dinner. 

I didnt even want to do anything, I only got my hopes up because they said we would do something. It would??ve been nice to at least get a text and a hug or a smile, that??s all I needed today. Instead I just spent the rest of the day in bed crying, and I??m probably going to do the same thing tomorrow.",1,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing significant loneliness due to being away from home for medical school. they miss their friends, family, and familiar surroundings, and their relationship has ended. their friends did not follow through on plans to celebrate their birthday, leaving them feeling isolated and unsupported. this culminated in them spending their birthday alone and crying, highlighting their deep sense of loneliness."

"A cup flooded with emptinessSo guys/gals, I tried it all.

I was somewhat OK with my life up until 2 years ago, not even anything to do with Covid, it's just the eternal loneliness and the fact that I push everyone away from me, mostly those who really wanna love me.

I can't put my feelings down and my mind feels like a gas giant where nothing makes sense, all I want is someone to be real with, but nobody likes sad people I guess, so I just go ahead and be me. Everyone else thinks I'm doing pretty good, so even when I try to vent I don't get the actual support I need, leaving me socially exhausted and I just stumbled upon this reddit because it feels like the best place to vent on, no idea if anyone is reading up to this point,

So anyway, I eat alone, I sleep alone, I don't even feel like talking to anybody - I just listen to Kanye and hit the gym frequently - the only thing I really feel like doing.

I don't even know why all this is happening, I'm studying, I tried to run my own startup and right now I feel like I'm in a point in my life where I did a lot of good beginnings but I actually have 0.00% energy left to do anything, this is chaos, I don't wanna keep being like this,

The fact that scares me the most is that I'm OK with most of it, I just feel like I don't care not having a good job, or living in my current state, like I'm OK with being mediocre, and god damn that sends chills down my spines just the thought of being so average,

I don't know what to do - Really, no \*\*\*\*ing idea how to get through this, at first I told myself it's just a phase and it'll pass, it doesn't.

I mostly believe in trusting the process, but there is no process.

Various people (mainly my first serious relationship) have conditioned me to feel like any sort of true vulnerability will just push people away. The nail in the coffin was my brother??s recent suicide. I can??t explain it??but since then, it feels like there??s a wall between me and everyone else in my life. I have no energy to talk to any of my friends on a regular basis. I??m stretched too thin trying to foster deeper connections at college all while hiding the fact that I??m dealing with grief because, like I said people have made me feel like any sign of vulnerability (crying, opening up about struggles, etc.) will push people away. So, I no longer feel like my authentic self anywhere. I hang out with people at school passively, they only know me surface level. I don??t have anyone I feel like I can count on or be real with. I do know some would be there for me but at the very core I feel like I just don??t think they understand what I??m going through because I really don??t even know what it is??I feel like it??s all my fault that I feel this alone and crying only gives me temporary relief from the existential dread of everything. I??m forcing myself to go to school because I fear I??ll regret it if I don??t get a degree. But right now, every second feels worse. I already took a medical leave of absence for my mental health once and it was hard enough then to go back. I fear doing it a second time will lead me to just drop out??But I don??t even really know the point is anymore I feel tired lost and alone and it feels like no one understands.

Idk why I couldn??t do it. I was intimidated by kids who were talking so excitedly in their own groups. I thought I would never be a part of them no matter how hard I try. I couldn??t open my mouth because I hated my voice. I was afraid of every second I was surrounded by other people. 

I was thinking about what I regret the most in my life, and this is the answer I think. I could have tried it anytime, but didn??t for two years. Not even once. I don??t know how it would have turned out, but every time I start thinking about the little boy who was sitting alone on an isolated chair where no one would look at, eating lunch all alone, barely swallowing any food because he was so self-conscious of people who were looking at him and talking behind his back. 

It already makes me embarrassed to think how I would tell my future spouse or children about those times. Even now I am totally clueless. Will I ever find any soulmates? Will any one love/like me the way I am? What if no one does? What if even I don??t like myself? Am I talking shitty about others because I myself am feeling worthless?

I??m one of those who constantly daydreams and have weird fantasies, so yeah relating to the title, loneliness has canalized this imagination into some twisted fantasy of me dying and then having them make a documentary like one of those in ID discovery channel where they interview the family and have actors playing the life of the victim and the family and friends saying oh he was a very happy and outgoing young man (the hell I was) lol and me just like watching that shit and seeing comments online on twitter like yeah depression shouldn??t come unnoticed or watching what my ??friends?? would have to say about it, or reading some girl on fb sharing a related post saying ??oh if only I knew this guy I??d take away all of his problems he was kinda cute though??.

I'm in the middle of a divorceI'm just feeling lonely tonight. I have friends as all of us do. Even if we think we don't :-) I was supposed to go to a comedy show tonight only seven miles from home. I have traveled hundreds of miles to see this comment before. Friends bought my ticket and wanted me to go. But when it came time I texted and said I wasn't feeling well. I'm just not into it. I like staying home in my cocoon with my dog. I work all week and I hold up all weekend. And this is not who I am.

I??ve had to isolate due to being immunocompromised so I haven??t seen friends or anything.

Music is a h u g e part of my life as well, i??m into most genres especially indie/alt rock, lofi and folk. making playlists for each other would be soso nice as well! here??s my spotify: https://open.spotify.com/user/joekenward66?si=Uk3Sd9-aQSuUMhdk1rud8Q&amp;dl_branch=1

i also love nature and spending time outside, especially walking my doggo (if you have one your legally obliged to send me pics heheheh). i??m also super interested in art even tho i don??t do much myself, but id really like to get into doing some digital stuff.

I don??t have any friends IRL aside from my boyfriend, and my immediate family. I am close with my parents and brother but they are 3,000+ miles away. It??s hard for me to get out much due to chronic illness. I don??t have any friends online either or chat with anyone. That is partially my fault. I find it draining to go through the same ??get to know you?? cycle of small talk over and over. Not to mention trust issues about sharing my life with a stranger (who I can??t even see) and getting close to someone as a friend.

I find myself wishing I already had a best friend that knows me well who I can trust. I like being there for my friends just as they are there for me, IF they are there for me.

"I hate friends and yet still want themI don't know why I'm making this post. I don't expect anyone to respond, but I guess it feels better than typing it out in a notepad that will be deleted almost immediately afterwards. Sorry if this is long, skip if you want to read something even remotely interesting.

I used to have friends. Kind of. Internet friends with whom I'd talk to nearly every second of every day. I don't know if I liked them much or if they even liked me at all, but it felt nice to have messages to wake up to.

I feel like I desperately want friends, but I also think I just want to stop feeling so sad. I don't even like people and I prefer to be alone. But I'm still lonely. Or maybe I just tell myself I don't like them because no one actually likes me lol. I know my family loves me, but I'm fairly certain even they don't actually ""like"" me. I don't socialize with anyone aside from them and it makes me feel lonely as hell. Then again, I was lonely even when I had a ""reliable"" internet friend group. I tried to get in touch with them recently, but everyone was older and different and didn't seem very interested.

I could go out or something. Maybe go to church, or get a job. Snatch up some friends and bazinga! Problem solved. But I'm pretty much incapable of actual socialization with real people (aside from my family, but it gets weird even with them) at this point. Like I'm just socially an absolute moron. I'm probably too stupid and immature to even handle a real job. I'm already 16 and I still feel like a toddler. I probably have the intellect of one.

But there's always the internet! I can text people and no one will know how socially inept I actually am! Ha, funny. I don't know how to make friends like I did when I was but a wee child. Now I just put up this persona and act like an uninterested asshole no one would want to hold a conversation with for longer than a minute. I start acting like the exact kind of people who I dislike speaking with and it feels like it's not even a choice. The way I'm typing right now doesn't even feel genuine, but at least it's not like ""bruhh k whatever ????????????????????????????????????????????????""

But I'm so so lonely. I can ignore it sometimes, but then there are nights like this when it feels like I'm going to implode.

A person who doesn??t mind is kind but to me the kinder person is the one who really doesn??t want to but still does it. 
I am often in the middle. I take joy in knowing I am helping or making someone??s day better. I go out of my way to smile and treat people respectfully hoping to myself that these small acts will make someone??s day a bit better. 

But true kindness is doing things that wouldn??t be rewarded they say. 

I don??t expect lavish gifts or rewards for my actions but I do hope that whomever would at least be a bit grateful for me going out of my way to do something for someone even if I don??t really feel like it. And to strangers it??s all the same. I??m just hoping they may be a bit happier.

They say they??d send me some but I tell them to do so when we get more stable. I take care of the housework and try to help my brother in anyway. (I live with my older brother who although a good human being isn??t really a responsible person.) to be honest I came here for college so I could ease my parents worries about my brother who was living alone. I got into the third best university in korea to make my family proud. I try so hard to maintain a good appearance so that I could be a friend and family member to be proud of. 
I??d make time in a very busy schedule to hang out with friends and give them the attention, time, and effort. 
Example, it was my friends birthday. I had work in the morning and a test the next day but I just crammed as much study time the week before just to make time to properly be able to celebrate her birthday.
There are many more instances like these. With my aunt, with coworkers, etc. 
And in the end of the day I sit back and hope that they will appreciate my efforts.
But my birthday was on the 22nd my aunt whom I time and time again helped when she was in a pinch asked me to work an 9 hour shift when she tells me all the time how wonderful of a boss she is and how, when her other workers have birthdays she gives them a day off. But I who was there from the day she opened her business, was there to help her settle, I who crashed my health hoping that it would be easier for her, I who by the simple fact that I love my aunt would work 6-7 days a week so she could settle down, gets a worse treatment than a part timer who started a month back?? The same goes for my family and friends. All I got is a text of ??happy birthday.?? 
I know that I in sense am not kind if I expect a sort of reward. But today I got an angry call from my mother saying ??oh? So now that you are 20 you think your so grown up? You think that now that you are an adult you can do whatever you want?!??
And the answer is no. I am a child who craves love and recognition. I lay at night and cry myself to sleep because I am tired. So so very tired. I was thrown to adulthood and I am trying to do my best but things just slip by my fingers and I am sad how I am at the flower of my youth and I am wasting it away. 
I think I??m depressed to be honest. I??ve been like this for the longest time, probably middle school. But I just want someone who appreciates the small and big things that I do. Someone who I am enough for. 
Someone to tell me that I??m doing good and that they are proud of my accomplishments. 
I just want to be loved. I have many friends and a wonderful family. 
But I have no one who looks at me. Like really looks at me. I am not the happy, pretty girl I show everyone. I study late into nights to get good grades. I work endless hours to support my brother and I. I work so so hard to be as attractive as I can be. And all for who? All for what? 
I guess this is all just angsty 20 year old talk but even if my brain understands that I might be being stupid the fact that I feel so empty and sad does not change. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Do you need me to listen to you just like you read through my ginormous monologue? Maybe we can hear each other and make ourselves a little less lonely? 
I don??t know all I want to say is thank you for reading this helluva of a long rant. I hope that for as sad as I am you the reader is as happy. 
Hoping the New Years is going to be a new start for all of us. 
Please be happy. And one last time thank you.",1,the person feels lonely because despite having friends and family they express a deep sense of isolation and lack of genuine recognition they feel their efforts to be kind and helpful go unnoticed and unappreciated they crave love and acknowledgment which they are not receiving leading to feelings of emptiness and sadness they also mention crying themselves to sleep and feeling depressed indicating a profound sense of loneliness and emotional fatigue
"I feel like I'm nosediving.I've always been alone. I'm 26, I've never been on a date, I've never been to a party, I only really have one real friend, but usually those things don't bother me a whole lot. I've got hobbies and such to keep myself busy. There have been rough patches, sure, but I'd say I've been OK most of the time.

The past two weeks though, I've been feeling just endlessly, soul-crushingly depressed about all that. I don't think I've ever wanted companionship as badly as I have in the past few days. I've cried over it, I've lost sleep over it, I can't focus on anything, it's just been gnawing at my brain nonstop 24/7 and I can't make it go away. I just want someone to invite me somewhere or a cute girl to message me on OKCupid and actually stick around instead of ghosting me. I can't tell you how badly I want it, it's such a deep, visceral want that I can almost physically feel it. I feel like my brain is slowly melting.

I just can't do this anymore. I've been telling myself for fucking years and years basically ""2012 is going to be the year! OK, 2012 didn't work, that means 2013! Alright, 2014. 2015? 2016? Please?"", and every year I'm slightly less successful and more and more lonely. How much longer do I have to do this? Am I going to be 36 thinking ""2032, maybe?""

So here's my plan, I'm giving myself the rest of 2021 to see if I can end the lifelong loneliness. If that doesn't work, if 2022 rolls around and I'm still alone, then I'm just ending it. I'm not doing another year of this, there's nothing anyone can say that can convince me to change my mind. I'm so tired.",1,"the person expresses a deep sense of isolation and longing for companionship. despite having hobbies and a friend, the overwhelming feeling of loneliness has intensified recently, leading to depression, sleep loss, and an inability to focus. the narrative reveals a persistent struggle with loneliness over the years, culminating in a plan to end their life if the situation does not improve. this indicates a profound sense of loneliness and despair."
"No one ever reaches out to meI never get any texts, no one invites me anywhere, I feel like everyone's a fake friend. Whenever I try to initiate texting/hanging out, usually it just turns into small talk or nothing pretty quickly. I just want people to talk to, who are close to me. I tried meeting new people but for some reason I find it hard to make friends, probably because I'm way more serious than the average person at my age (15). The friends I already have are really fun to talk to, I just wish we did that more often. I don't wanna go and tell them that I need more attention, because 1. Who does that and 2. It seems too needy and ego, and I feel like they aren't enjoying the conversation, and just trying to be nice to me so that I feel better. I just wish they were honest.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness because they feel isolated and disconnected from others. they express a lack of meaningful communication and genuine connections, feeling that their friends are not truly interested in engaging with them. they also mention difficulty in making new friends and a sense of being different from their peers, contributing to their feelings of loneliness."

Today being 20 is weird and awkward because I don??t have a relationship with my mom. My sister and her can just talk about anything. But when my mom and I talk there??s always an awkward pause or silence because I don??t know what to talk about with her. I??ve been trying for years to bond with her but she doesn??t try. It doesn??t help that her boyfriend of 10 years is an ass munch and disrespects me any chance he gets. I feel like I??ve been in defense mode ever since I was 10. This past week my sister graduated and even though I??m super proud of her,
I looked at my moms Facebook and it??s all of my sister.
You could never tell my mom has two other kids. I have no one to talk too, no one in my family can ??deal with me?? because I struggle with depression and anxiety, they??re the type to sweep it under the rug and not recognize it.

What??s wrong with me?????I finished high school in 2018 and since then my life has gone downhill.I was on Facebook and I found out one of my friends from high school got married and that just caused me to go deeper into the rabbit hole and searched all of my friends and all of them are happy, have soulmates and successful.

The thing is that I??m struggling with my mental health. I always have, but the last month it??s gotten worse. It??s so hard for me to tell anyone because I feel like a burden, but I??ve been so bad that I have. But I receive no response. Two weeks ago I asked if anyone could receive me in their home because I had tried to kill myself in mine (and my mom just got angry at me so I needed some support) and no answer. Now I reached out because I??m feeling the urge again but no one cares.
At first I thought it was because I was a bit vague, maybe they didn??t understand what I meant.

I'm undesirable. In every sense of the word. I have way too much emotional baggage. I don't even have the intellect to justify that now though ever since I low key murdered my braincells with drugs and alcohol and I continue to do so. 

I left my ex five months ago? I don't miss her, but I almost miss being with someone. At least having enough physical contact as a human. I don't get that now. That's what I miss though.

I can't seem to find a reason why someone could have any feelings for me. I'm fucking ugly, for one, and now that my personality has been reduced to just the druggie, I haven't got much going for me I suppose.

Humans are social creatures, as much as I wish that wasn't true I'm afraid it's written in our biology. I just wish I didn't crave something can't have.

LonelyI??ve been feeling like this recently when I??m by myself in my room. I haven??t really had friends for a couple of years I talk mostly to family nieces and nephews and sisters but I still feel lonely that I have no one my age to talk about my interests like anime KDramas or random things.

Since I work for my family I don??t really meet new people. I cry when I??m driving home at night because I catch myself have full blown conversation with myself.

It was her birthday yesterday, I sent a message wishing her a happy birthday and still nothing. I??m really anxious and heartbroken from this.

Everyone tells me that I??m smart, I??m charming, I??m funny, but so few people seem to actually give a shit about me. I??ve never been in a relationship before. I know this shouldn??t be a big deal but it??s always been a big source of sadness, embarrassment, and confusion for me.

I'm fat and ugly. I bet everyone hates me for it. 

I also have bad hygiene. I don't think it's caused by depression, I've always had it. I just smell bad 24/7.

Especially now during this ever-lasting pandemic of which I don't see any end to, everyday seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours, and hours feel like days, and days feel like a week and so on.

I really hate that I always feel this alone and that I??ve pretty much given up on anything resembling a relationship, even my ex didn??t want anything physical and there was 0 passion I just tried to lift them up when they felt down and tried to be their for them and their family.

People laugh at the idea including friends eve if not to my face. For context I??m a lesbian (lowering possible partners) and I??m tran, which makes it even harder. At this point I have genuinely given up on a real relationship, I told a friend I liked her (not expecting anything to come of it cos she??s 1) straight and 2) in a relationship.

"The Living DeadIf you've been living like me for the past 14 years in a life with no substance, with no goals or enthusiam you are dead but living, your brain keeps the body alive or you keep it by eating food and sleeping but you are dead.That's what i've discovered about myself.

Im not gay but I really think I'd be open to it if it meant someone would just hug me and show interest in my life. 

This isnt a contest but I dont think most people understand this level of social isolation. I cant be alone forever. I just want someone next to me in bed or in the bedroom next to mine.

"Raised to be lonelyPast couple of days I've thought about a lot where my life has been, where it came from and where I might be. I'm 29 and on the verge of hitting 30 in the next 5 months. Growing up i never realized how lonely and alone I was when I was a kid, i think it was because has kids we all had those blinders of ""ignorance is bless."" I was an only child believe it not the only ONLY child in my entire family (everyone else has had 2+ more kids). So I've always felt and been like the black sheep of my family. I came from a strict household family from old school European values, not that it was bad because its how i learned to be respectful and the decent person I am today. But, I was definitely a sheltered child. Never really hung out with friends or had a sleepover or been to one or gone to camp or experience anything friend related i think until 14 maybe even 15. I've always kept to myself and just stuck to my hobbies and just overall enjoyed being by myself. Learned a lot about morals and values through my favorite 90s TV shows and some good books I've read. Fast forward through my adult life and I've been through a lot as well! I've been married, gotten divorced, lost touch with a lot of people (mainly because of found relationships or paths going different ways), experience deaths in my family. You know all the things people can relate to! I think the biggest thing to happen to me so far is my failed marriage and relationship that happened about 5 years ago. You never realize how alone you really are until its literally just you again! As a gamer I always said ""I hit the reset button on my life"" and it was literally just that because i had no idea what was going to happen or where to even begin with anything and everything. Again fast forward today, I never realized how much ive actually been alone as a kid and how much ive actually been use to it that its something that shouldn't bother me because I was raised like that. I've always had more pressure or treated differently by my parents because well i was their only child and they just expected a lot from their own child. I love my parents, they're great individuals and im not sure where I'd be without them today. You know it definitely is the little things in life that makes you realize being lonely or alone isn't bad when you break everything down in a list. When i made my list I actually found that my pros heavily out weighted my cons completely. But, because I went through that adult phase, that experience of being in love and being with someone you spent most of your adulthood from 18-25 and then it just be gone like that i think thats what got me the most. Its alright to be alone, its OK to feel lonely as well, im human and I know once in a blue moon all those feelings will come back and hit me like a ton of bricks but I'm grateful for what I have, for who I am as a person, and for what I can do. The only real thing missing in my life really is a relationship, a partner crime, my missing puzzle piece! But I realize if I do end up alone or by myself for the remainder of my life, that would be alright to because my life has meaning in a lot of my branches in my tree of life and I shouldn't let one little dead branch corrupt all the ones that keep growing and bloom each year around!

I've lived through almost a third of my entire life without ever experiencing anything resembling intimacy with another human being, never held hands, never been on a date, let alone kissed. I'm haunted by the fact that whenever, if ever, I'll get to have this kind of interactions with someone I, a fully grown adult, will have to explain to them that i don't know what I'm doing.

"Perfectly brokenI just spent some time replying to posts here and thought it's time to make one myself! Today marks 1 year that my ex and I parted ways, and the loneliness has come in waves since then. But anxiety and depression have been steadily sneaking up on me, and I'm realizing how much the lack of human connection is affecting me. The happiest times in my life were those in school when I was surrounded by people that cared about me, however slight. The lowest have been the opposite, when I isolate myself and withdraw from friendships.

Ultimately I think what's eating at me is a denial of self. My heart naturally wants to give and love others, but all it takes is a thought reminder of how I've gotten hurt in the past to keep me doing nothing. My mind will try to make me feel better by telling me I don't need anyone to be happy. Like, there were yogis that would stay in a cave for years and find eternal peace within. If they can do it, so can I, right? I'm realizing the isolation path is like doing life on hard mode, there are far easier ways to be happy again, and all it really takes is putting myself out there without fear of rejection in order to build the support systems I need to get through the hard times.

No one is perfect, and we don't have to wait to become perfect before we try to make real connections with others. There will inevitably be mistakes made and heartaches.

I received no messages from no one. I'm starting to think that my best friend is hating on me. I really don't know what to do.

I feel like I love him but I know this isn't the case as it has happened before with other person I called a friend and I got over her in 2 years. I keep thinking about him before bed and stuff, as you do. I could technically ask him out and he would probably give it a try but he'd just semi like me and I'd realize I don't love him in a week and it would be a mess and I'd lose the only person willing to talk to me who also isn't a total shithead and has something in common. If he said no I'd lose whatever shred of confidence I have in my looks and feel even more pathetic granted I've fallen for only 2 people who gave me a shred of attention.

"Don??t listen to people with cliche answers on how to lead a better lifeNobody is going to approach you because they barely acknowledge your existence. The only possible reason people care about you is because there scared that if you die it would hurt them so they don??t care deep down about how you really feel nor do they want to try to care they just tell you not to end it. No girl/boy is going to approach you and ask you out because most of us are losers who can??t get anyone because we don??t look like the 1% who get asked to take pictures and go to parties and have the time of their lives whilst we stay at home wanting to die.

There is no change anywhere and it doesn??t exist. We were all born to be like this and the same things keep happening over and over to prevent us from breaking free from loneliness. Take me for example, last year I met a girl she was nice and I got out of my shell for her. She was actually leading me on and using me so she could get close to my friend. They??re together now, still. This year I had it with my loneliness and decided to join a society, I email this particular society and I get an email from the boyfriend of the girl I liked thanking me for joining the society. Some absolute bullshit but that??s just how it works.

"I had a friendship with someone I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a hole in me
Around a year ago I was in a really rough place. I felt very alone, and I also felt like a failure and a hypocrite. Despite these feeling I had a fairly ok social life. I would go out and spend time with friends but I always felt a disconnect from them. I would hangout with them but we never felt ""close"". I talked to a few people I had met online from posting on reddit and that was nice but I still felt very alone. 

Then I met ""L"". I really didn't even expect a friendship to happen, we were both pretty awkward but we were real with each other so we ended up continuing to talk. Our conversations were about things we cared about or even just random musings. We would share memes, watch tv shows together, and stay up late into the night just hanging out with each other. 

For the first time in a long time I could really bear my soul with someone. I have a lot of bottled up issues. Self esteem issues, confidence issues, loneliness, mild mental health issues (Mild depression/anxiety/adhd). We talked about these things as she had some similar issues. Neither of us had to hide who we were from each other and it was really nice. We could share our faults with each other and not feel judged, we could be honest about our loneliness without being judged, and we could comfort each other. Despite only knowing each other online we got to know each other quite well through skype calls. 

As time went on an attraction grew, we started to flirt some and I'm not going to go into details but there were a few moments of online passion. What was amazing about that is we could still be ourselves. I wanted to please her, and she wanted to please me, and we were both open about it. If one of us needed comfort the other wanted to give it. It was a deeply refreshing experience to not only have someone who wanted to comfort me when I was feeling sad but also who wanted me to comfort them when they were sad. 

Eventually though we started to drift apart, we had different goals in life and our short 5-8 month romance had more or less run its course. It wasn't all perfect, she was a good 6 years younger than me (i'm 27) and that created a strain at times because I thought she had a lot of co-dependence with her parents who I also think abused her (not physically but emotionally). She could also be quite naive at times. I wasn't always the most understanding, I wanted her to act like someone my age when she frankly wasn't, and I only am who I am now cause I was immature as a 21 year old as well. 

So It ended, and now for months and months Ive had this empty hole in me because I miss it. I miss her but I understand why it ended and why it needed to but I miss having someone I could be that vulnerable with.",1,"the narrative describes a person who feels a profound sense of loneliness despite having a social life. they mention feeling a disconnect from their friends and having self-esteem and confidence issues. the person found solace in an online friendship that provided emotional intimacy and understanding, which they had been missing. the end of this relationship has left them feeling empty and longing for the connection they once had. this indicates a deep sense of loneliness and a struggle to find meaningful connections in their life."
"Why is it so hard to be accepted and find love?I??m just so tired of being this lonely. I??m 26 years old and I??ve had only 1 girlfriend ( back when I was 18 ) and it??s just impossible for me to be with someone else... I look ridiculously young and I get treated like if I were 12, and often women just trait up ignore me. I??m lonely, scared of being lonely, but special scared about finding someone. I??m 26 yo and I??ve got no experience in dating, in sex, in having someone and taking care of that someone. I??m just... lonely.
And scared.",1,"the person expresses feelings of loneliness and frustration about not being accepted or finding love. they mention a lack of experience in relationships and feeling ignored by others, which contributes to their loneliness. their repeated emphasis on being lonely and scared further indicates their emotional state."
"Nobody would really even notice if I wasn??t there anymoreI??ve posted before about being the background friend, and my current situation has really just confirmed it. My roommate is breaking her lease and moving out, leaving me responsible for her half of the rent and other living expenses. I prepaid everything upfront with my federal grants as a grad student. With her moving out, and me being a full time student with little to no income, I??m facing eviction and homelessness. 

I??ve tried reaching out to talk to people to I go to for support, and it??s clear the subject has made them uncomfortable because all I get in return is ??oh that sucks I??m sorry.?? And then they just stop responding. I??ve spent the last two weeks trying to apply to everything I can find, finding food pantries, trying to negotiate bills, asking people I trust to take care of my pets when I get evicted. But it??s become so very painfully clear that help is just not coming. I am alone and I??ll very shortly be alone and homeless during December in the Midwest. 

I??m exhausted. I haven??t slept in days, I haven??t really eaten either. I??m trying to make anything my cats/dog could eat lasts as long as possible so at the very least they aren??t going hungry. I??m so fucking tired of keeping it all inside and putting on a fake ass smile when I really feel like I??m going to collapse at any moment.

"Struggles of a realist who dreams like an idealistI dont care about having lots of friends, what I want is someone who really knows me, who I am fully comfortable with, and will put me first like I will put them first. It dosent even have to be romantic.

When I see fictional couples or friendships it makes my heart ache because I want that deep connection with somebody. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that real people just arent made that way. We're too selfish and no one can truly understand anyone else. What I want is a soulmate but there is no such thing. 

Most of my friendships have been pretty one-sided, with me really caring and them taking me for granted and treating me like crap and I've never actually had a romantic relationship. Probably my own fault but at this point I dont see why I would bother. I've kind of given up on other people I guess.

"I wish I knew how to feel attachmentSo many people are lonely because of rejection. Or they miss that one somebody. Or perhaps they just don??t have the guts to talk to that *one somebody*. 

But damn. I just don??t know how to feel anymore. I can??t love platonically, much less romantically. 

I am disposable to everyone. I usually befriend the ??outcasts??. It??s normally a one way street: They talk of their problems. I help them out. I??m still a mysterious figure to them. If I do share anything personal, it??s usually with no emotion. I just state my burdens stoically, as facts. Once they find their niche, they bid farewell to me for good. No hard feelings. No bad blood. I was just their jumpstart. I have no emotional attachment to them. They still acknowledge me, but it??s nothing more than routine. Then they stop even acknowledging me. 

I so painfully long to feel something about this all. I want to be able to talk candidly about my life. But my reality is far too much for anyone. How can I talk about the weather and sports when depression and ptsd constantly scrape my mind utterly raw? How can I care about what I wear, when I??m working my ass off just to stay afloat and keep my mouth shut? How can I desire any form of intimacy without harboring constant terror of being taken advantage of? Slandered? Attacked? Raped? I don??t know how to fucking love anymore. I can??t. I want to so badly, but the best I can do is indifferent. Indifferent? Is that what someone wants in a friend? My abrasive unlikableness doesn??t help either. Indifferent is as positive as I can feel, but there is plenty worse to be seen. I rarely smile. Not because I??m a *BaD AsS*, but because smiling gets you nothing but motherfucking trauma. Plus, smiling is a pain when you feel nothing of the sort. It kind of disgusts me, when people smile all the time. Even when they??re being an absolute bitch. If you??re gonna be a bitch, be a straight up bitch, no need to be two-faces about it. Oddly enough, usually, the only times I smile outside the confines of my house are when I??m in severe psychological pain. I call it the Overcompensation Station ^TM .

I dream, sometimes, of finding someone (which is the most ridiculously far-fetched thing I??ve ever heard), but those thoughts usually turn sour. I??ve given up on the dream of changing. It??s going on 4 years now. 4 damn years filled with therapy and psychiatrists and medicines and coping skills. And I still want to die. Something is so broken inside me, severed even, I don??t think I??ll ever be able to be normal again. ??But, coffeenpills, normal is a relative term,?? they say. Shut the fuck up. Just stop. I??m in the slimmest percent of so many things. I??ve had a psychiatrist tell me they??ve never met a fucking patient like me before. Another said that I should fix *myself*. I??m the broken of the broken. The outcast of outcasts. The laughing stock of the abused jesters. And I wish I could cease. 

TL;DR: I fucking hate myself.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness due to their inability to form emotional attachments and feeling disposable to others. they help others but remain a mysterious figure, leading to transient relationships. their emotional detachment and fear of intimacy further isolate them, exacerbating their sense of loneliness."

"Feeling alone in times of changeHey guys, just thought I'll write my recent thoughts down here. So although I am actually kinda extroverted and enjoy being with people my friend circle dispersed pretty hard since corona. It happened a few times before that friend circles kinda dispersed with everyone going their way and having new people while I always feel left alone. 

Right now I have some difficult times since I found out I hate my job and want to learn something new. I will look into 2 different professions in the next 2 weeks (so 2 internships). I'm kinda excited to see what it's like but I am also scared that if I don't like either of them I have no clue what to do. The only people I can share this with right now are my mom and a friend who is really inconsistent at answering messages or voice notes. 

Actually got an appointment and had my first session with a psychologist this week, but with the internships the next 2 weeks I will only meet her in 3 weeks again. Talking about such stuff felt pretty good and I am kinda sad that I won't be able to talk someone outside my little circle about this topic. 

Idk I just kinda wish I also had this group of people who you have consistent contact/meetups and can share such things. Right now I have to force myself to get outside my room so I don't feel completely miserable, but although I feel being outside is good for me its just not the same with always being alone. No matter if I take a walk, or ride my bycicle or whatever I just feel so isolated from the world while all I see outside are people being together.

STFU MY STUPID HEADWelp here I am lying in bed crying on and off and I just can??t take it. All I can hear is myself talking to me in my head. I have music on but can??t even listen to it. I just want to hear someone else??s voice but have no ones to hear.

"Does anyone else feel like they have friends but you can't relate to them because your hobbies are too weird?I have a few friends who I would consider close, mainly because they check up on me and invite me to go places. But I feel like I have no one to talk about the things I'm really passionate about without feeling like they are just waiting for me to stop to change the topic.I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years not long ago  and she would put up with my nonsense and it felt like she was genuinely interested in what I had to say. But as far as my boys go they don't really seem to care.And it's not that my hobbies are weird, it's just that no one my age group is really into it. I'm 20 and I am really interested in older cars. The fact that a car from the 60s can run without the help of a computer is amazing to me.I recently bought a 1966 Chrysler Newport and the owner of the car is a retired firefighter and me and him actually got along really well. He asked me if I could help him wire up some stuff on a older truck he has. I think this is cool but the fact that I have to be friends with someone three times my age shows how far off my hobbies are from people my age lol. I also like talking about guns and playing DayZ on my computer, which is a very niche game not many people play. The one hobby I feel like I can relate with people is weight lifting, as I do it very frequently. But I wouldn't really consider it a hobby since I don't really enjoy it. Mainly doing it to look good naked.But yeah... That's my little rant. Feels good to get it off my chest.",1,"the person feels disconnected from their peers despite having friends they consider close. they struggle to find people who share their niche interests and feel that their friends do not genuinely care about their passions. the recent breakup with their girlfriend, who did show interest, adds to their sense of loneliness. they find more connection with an older individual who shares their hobby, highlighting their difficulty in relating to people their own age. overall, the narrative reflects feelings of isolation and a lack of meaningful connections based on shared interests."
"Just a lonely teen (17m) - talking about myselfThis post doesn??t have a point to it. I just want to express my thoughts anonymously. This post is just a dump of my inner thoughts. The writing will be all over the place   


When I??m older I??m not gonna remember my teenage years, I barley even remember them now honestly. I don??t remember when my feelings of loneliness began, possibly 2018 when all of a sudden I just started thinking negatively and haven??t stopped. I??ve never had a best friend who I can tell anything, who I can spend time with laughing and talking about anything. My friends I was ??close?? with then I??m not now. 2 of them are in my current group but i don??t talk to friend M because I didn't feel like she valued me as a friend (rightfully so) this I realised last year, same with friend F but I still share a few words with her occasionally. I think my insecurI ties about my sexuality and expressing myself is the reason why I don??t let people in. 

I do have friends but I??m not as close as I could be with them. If I accepted my self earlier maybe I??d be closer to them.

God writing about social shit for me is kinda hard - all these ??issues?? stem from me not accepting my self sooner. I??d be closer to people and have more confidence if I accepted my sexuality and self identity but I haven??t. I can Invision an alternate dimension where I accepted myself sooner a reality where how I view socialisation is different and it??s not so weird.   


My life isn??t hard at all, it??s easy. I have no issues in life except for my mental health. I could be depressed idk. I think I probably am but I don??t plan on getting diagnosed. Ok so I guess my life is fine, all my issues are in my head. I don??t need to be expressing my thought here but I am.

When I see other people at school I feel like they??ve accepted their identity already. They have lives and friends. And they aren??t struggling with self worth and sexuality but I know that??s not true. Everyone is dealing with something,, I know that but that??s just how I view the world around me. I know life for everyone isn??t perfect but at least they feel comfortable with who they are. I think that??s the most important thing in life, your self worth. Because you see the world around you through your eyes and if you don??t like yourself your gonna view the world negatively.

   
I don??t have a plan for my future career wise but I think after high school I??d like to start working out and eating healthy to try and develop my self-esteem.

ive been writing this for a long time, just thinking about my life, what little of a life I have and how my issues aren??t really issues. I guess struggles would be a more appropriate word. I don??t have issues but I am struggling with my self esteem.

"Ever just surrendered to it?I've always been a loner, and not of my own choosing.  I try to make friends, but it's like I'm invisible and most people forget I exist after 2 seconds.  I will literally physically get shut out of groups when people close ranks, so to speak, and I get shifted to the outside of the circle so I'm not a part of it any more (I wish I knew how to describe this in words better, but it does happen).  The few friends I do manage to make turn on me once they get whatever they wanted, and resort to placating me with ""yeah we should meet up sometime"" and mysteriously always are too busy to actually do it.  Never had a relationship.  I can't even really make friends, let alone find a date.  My own relatives doesn't talk to me unless they are in the same room with me.  I flat don't exist to them.  No matter what I do, I'm an outcast.

I've had thoughts recently of wanting to just move somewhere new and not even bother trying to make friends there.  Then I don't have to feel like I'm being pushed aside.  You can't be ignored if no one knows you exist in the first place.

When I meet someone I like I have a bad habit of getting obsessed even though I don't think I display it, they probably can catch on.

I just want to feel loved and be loved and every chance I get seems to slip through my fingers and making my loneliness stronger and making me feel unlovable. I have no one to talk to because my friends get annoyed as I probably bring it up every few months but I just don't know what to do to meet someone or to get them to hang around. Any tips would help",1,"the person is experiencing feelings of loneliness because they express a strong desire to be loved and have an official relationship but have been unsuccessful in forming lasting connections. they also mention having no one to talk to as their friends get annoyed when they bring up the topic, which further contributes to their sense of isolation and loneliness."

"Need to be able to give upI keep trying to have friends and find people to talk to. The sad thing is that I occasionally find someone willing to talk more than a few basic messages. I get my hopes up, and try to get to know the person. Before long, the same thing happens. Nothing. I get ignored and forgotten. Or I assume I will get ignored and forgotten and cut the person off first. And yes, I know that shows how broken I am. 

I am so desperate for any shred of human connection, I spend too much time seeking it out, checking for notifications, checking apps anyway when I see zero notifications??.and I keep getting let down. Over and over. And I am not mad at anyone. Nobody is obligated to talk to me. They just don??t feel a connection or have an interest and move on. It??s just how people are, including me, so I understand. But when it happens with literally everyone, including my family, it hurts. 

Ok, I have a wife, but she doesn??t want to talk to me or to listen to me.

"I feel so unwelcome around other peopleWhen I was little, my parents always said things like ??you need to fix yourself?? and ??If you don??t start *blank* I won??t love you anymore?? and have threatened to send me back to my ??real?? parents (they used to lie about me being adopted). When I was the new kid at an elementary school and tried to make friends with a kid who looked  lonely, she was immediately aggressive towards me and soon said something along the lines of ??No one will ever want to be your friend or like you. You??re gross, ugly, and stupid.?? When I was in middle school and actually managed to get some friends, and introduced some of them to each other, they started to hang out with me way less. I remember in 6th grade I went up to a friend because he promised to work on a group project with me and he told me ??go away and work on it yourself.?? I got upset at him and all he told me in response was, ??You know what, I don??t even want to be your friend anymore.?? I cried during lunchtime and he had the audacity to get a lunch lady to tell me to ??stop crying because it was making him uncomfortable.?? Speaking of group projects, they have always been among the worst experiences for me. I got called too stupid for drawing poorly in middle school and I forgot how to do something in science and someone said ??wow you??re not as smart as I thought you would be.?? Group projects became hell in high school. No one wanted to be in the same group with me for one project, so I had no choice but to not only work 4 times as much (it was a 4-5 people group project) but also present to the class for four times as long while trying to overcome anxiety and the terrible speech impediment I had. I got a C(+?) mainly because of ??my constant stuttering, trouble focusing, and working alone,?? according to the teacher. In another project, I was literally locked out of accessing the presentation online because a group member felt ??I was getting in the way?? even after I helped bring information and organized it; they kept my contributions in tact, I guess they just didn??t want me to be there because they disliked me. There??s also the time when I literally just asked a question to my group (a different group that is unrelated to the last one) and the leader straight up told me, ??Everyone here agrees and understands except you. If you can??t be on the same page, then maybe you should just leave the group?? even though I had tried my best to be helpful. I??d go on longer, and talk more about events that are unrelated to school, but this post has gotten too long already. Those same people are the ones who get awards, have loving families, friends who support them, ect. while I??m the one who??s stuck crying in bed. I wish I could live happily like they do and I??m trying my hardest, I really am. But it begins to feel impossible when you have been let down so many times and have had your self-esteem destroyed. I wish I weren??t so awful so the world wouldn??t have to think I deserve this.

"HollowThis is what I became. Oh, and alone too. I thought I found someone special (my ex) but when we broke, everyone trated me like a pile of garbage. 
Also, my situation is huge paradox. People always define me as ""handsome"", so everyone ask ""how can you be so lonely and shy and very often single?"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking May help, but it's not a golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all. Especially if you are a boy. I only have some real friends (and I consider them a HUGE privilege I don't even deserve). All the remaining people only look for me when they need something (both in Uni or not). So I am not only lonely, but I also have unhuman expectations from others (I've noticed It especially when I try to date a girl). And that's depressing to see how this society Is based mainly on the looks.

But still, I'm lonely. Except for my Brother, nobody never ask me if I feel bad. Because I am the cool one, the ""chad that can't never, ever be depressed or sad"". But -SURPRISE- I am.

They are asleep and you're all alone.

I'm kind of an artsy guy, and out here it's mostly a few farmers and rednecks. Not that there's anything wrong with being those things, but it's not really my crowd. 

I've traveled. I spent a few years in a AmeriCorps and worked for the feds in emergency management for a brief bit of time, travelling the country. I made some friends, even had a relationship here and there, but I always seem to end up back here on my parent's farm. 

There's nothing out here. It's a blessing and a curse. The quiet is nice sometimes, but there's nobody to hang out with, nowhere to go. I've been stuck out here before a time or two. The longest stretch was nearly a year of talking to virtually nobody but my parents on occasion. Human beings aren't meant to live like this. It does terrible things to your mind. 

I'm taking a class at a nearby community college (it's a long commute), and God willing next semester I'll be able to take up a full time schedule and live on campus, but in the meantime it can be hard to cope with the loneliness.

I find it hard to do my job at work lately. I??m 18 and haven??t been working long, but it??s already difficult to not tear up if I let my mind wander. Everything in my life is monotonous. One friend after another has begun talking to me less and less. I??ve started to notice a pattern whenever I meet someone new where things start nicely but they quickly lose interest, and often times call me uninteresting or lacking energy. Things I can??t change give me intense anxiety, like climate change and wars, but I know that??s impossible for me to fix.

"I'm So lonelyMan I don't even know what the fuck  to say, Lately I have been to lonely. I tend to be a night owl and play games for hours on end. Every night without fail I will think of girl that I have liked for a couple of years and wish so badly I could tell her how much I liked her. Also recently I learned that one of our mutual friends might be in some kind of a relationship with her and that kind of killed me a little. This is not a sexual type thing,I genuinely like her for being a good person and putting up with my stupid antics and yet still being able to smile at me. For the years I have known her we (meaning her,me and a couple of other people have gone camping) have done the usual shit high school kids do late at night like ask each other who likes who and play dumb games like Kill Fuck Marry, every time they ask me I never say who it is due to not wanting to look like a fool and also not wanting to royally fuck the groups dynamics, I always give them hints but they never guess. I have was forced to promise them that I will tell when I graduate (I am a junior,1 older than the majority of them) in 2020 and enlist because I anticipate that I will feel that way after being disconnected for so long or just not be alive. It just hurts having put up a wall of edgy jokes and drugs and when it really matters having so much  to give and  being loyal to a fault and then having nobody even realize that you deeply care for people when shit gets real.

After she stopped me from committing suicide recently she was ordered to block me on social media by her parents leaving me with no way of even being able to try and keep some emotional bond with her. 11 months ago, I still had hope that we would get back together, that she would take me back, but I began loosing hope short after.. she started dating again, found new friends, was living her life while i was just rotting alone in my house, hoping for a miracle changing my life, spinning it 180 degrees... but that never happened, and never will. She will never want me again and i know that no one else ever will.. I guess that I??m just unlovable.
Maybe 3 or so months ago i met a girl online, we began just casually talking about life and both enjoyed it, we grew to be quite good friends but in the last month she was rushed to the hospital, later then transferred to a mental hospital, and the only information i was getting came from a guy that a week before all of that saved her after a suicide attempt. Now he got her out of there and is taking care of her at his house. We caught up on how she??s doing every day but in the past two days he hasn??t replied to my text, I don??t know what??s happening with him or her... and i once again just have no one, no one i can speak to, no one who cares about me.... i just want to meet that one person who I will be able to cuddle with, laugh with, just love and spend my life with... even the ??happy pill?? brings no resolution to the extreme emptiness and despair i feel in my heart..

Anyway, I??m M17 (almost 18) and going to university for Sports journalism. I have never been in a relationship w a girl even though my countless attempts. Today a girl told me she doesn??t think we match  and that I??m a nice guy but not for her. And I??m not mad at her, or the countless girls who said the same thing. If anything I??m mad at myself for not being lovable enough for someone. I??m really not looking for a quick fuck, or nudes. I??ve tried online dating, irl, literally most things and I??ve lost hope. I??ve talked to so many different girls and there??s a reason why all of them said no. I don??t know what it is but I wish I did so I could change it. I don??t think I??m overtly nerdy or weird, maybe sometimes dumb or stupid but not trashy.

I understand life is busy, heck, mine is extremely busy. But, this happening in me for the nth time? After multiple cancellations? Damn, this hurts. Not only do I get this, no one ever replies to me when I text them, even if I do, it??s ??oh sorry I forgot.?? Reading that multiple times again and again just tells me how unimportant and forgettable I am to these people. I try really hard to maintain these friendships. I spend so much time, energy, and money to make sure that I??m there for them. I rarely ever cancel and I??m there when needed or wanted. When plans get cancelled on you, but you see all their posts hanging out with other people. Man, I??d rather be dumped by another person. This just feels another form of heartbreak that I??m not sure I can ever recover from.

Also tried to make new friends. I thought I was part of a friend group. Realized today that they??ve been making plans and not inviting me. Got a pity invite today because someone accidentally told me. I can feel how unwanted I was. 

Man, what??s wrong with me? Yes, I??m not interesting nor boring. But I??m not awful. I??m not perfect either. But I didn??t think I was this disgusting person that no one even wants to be friends with..

Then I was told I should be happy someone used me as a second choice as they didn't have to pick me at all.

I have no one. I wasn??t born and raised where I am now so I have no friends at all. Don??t have anyone else to talk to, or go to. I??m used to being by myself and being lonely.

I have been going through a rough patch of life for the past couple months.  I can't bottle up my emotions any more but I can't talk about it with anyone.  For reference, I'm 21M, still living with my parents because college.  Every day now I feel like I'm just putting on an act whenever I'm around people.  I'm so self conscious that I'm too afraid to really be myself around anyone.  I only have a few close friends and I know for a fact that maybe with one exception they wouldn't understand what I'm going through because of their backgrounds and beliefs.

I just wish I had someone who I could talk to that wouldn't judge me.  I know there are various websites you can do that on (I'm on 7 cups for one) but the majority of the people on there don't seem to actually care about having a conversation and it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall.

I don't know how to explain it.  I can't trust anyone and I just want to curl up and cry because I bottle up my emotions too much.  I don't know why I'm even making this post, I'm probably going to delete this in 20 minutes anyways because I'm self conscious like that.

"aloneI'm alone, tis as simple as that. I don't have friends, I don't have irl friends, I don't have family, I don't have a partner, and I live alone. I don't talk much or go outside at all. I spend my days sleeping sedated, eating too much, noming edibles, curled up in as many soft blankets and comforts I have. My loneliness and traumatic memories have collapsed me into a being of nothingness. I'm just a pure ball of sadness and emotions that's too much for anyone to handle. I withhold myself from others so I don't cause anyone hurt or ruin anyones day. 

I go days without texting anyone, no one ever texts me first. Makes me feel unwanted and unloved. Maybe that's just what I am, an unstable unwanted freak who cries whenever someone leaves. I have real bad abandonment anxiety, the couple times I did actually meet people, I always cried when they left. It was so painful- the loneliness crushing me as fast as it could. It scared off a lot of people from being around me, and I don't blame them, no one wants to see a friend break down in panic as they leave.

My dreams are all nightmares. All mocking me. Thoroughly ripping off the scab each time. Sometimes I have a good dream, but then I wake up wishing I could go back. 

I don't know what my goal is posting here. I rarely ever post at all, I try not too. Maybe I just want my pain to be heard. Maybe I'm so bored and lonely I'm willing to do anything that'll get someone to acknowledge my existence.

"Just a vent. Sorry.When I was 13 I had a crush on this girl from school. I was too afraid to say anything, so we just became friends. Then, at 15, she says to me, all of the sudden, that she thought I was cute and she liked me. She said this to me over the phone. When she was moving to another country. 

At 17, I hang with this guy that's in 4 of my classes. He's popular, handsome and has great social skills. We have nothing in common, but still cares about me and asks me things about myself. He smiles everytime he sees at me. And it's very confusing- I didnt know what or how to feel, only that I liked the way I felt when I was around him. So yeah, I start to like this guy. Then I had this lame thought that maybe he likes me back. And, out of fear of things ending up like 2 years ago with this girl , I tell him. He asked me if I was joking. He stopped talking to me as soon as he realized I was serious. Ghosted me and blocked me from FB. 

I know it doesnt seem like much of a deal, but it hurt like hell. Made me feel bad about myself, and then depression and anxiety got worst. I started to hide every feeling- good or bad. I just didnt want to get hurt again. Not by dates, not by friends, not by family. I didn't wanna feel any thing.

I tried to date after that. The few people interested in me would get the idea that I wasn't into them. And I don't blame them. I've always been bad at talking and keeping in touch. I'd seem 'numb' or even bored to them and they'd leave. And this hurt even more so I tried to get ahead of em, and I'd push them away before they could to the same to me. 

But now, at 27, after this woman that was into me for the past year is now in a relationship, I wanna stop doing that. I wanna re-learn to talk to people. Not just to date. I don't wanna give this vibe that I hate everyone. I don't wanna feel numb and empty inside.",1,the person is lonely because they have experienced repeated rejection and emotional pain which has led them to isolate themselves emotionally and socially they have difficulty expressing their feelings and maintaining relationships which has contributed to their sense of loneliness and emptiness

"I'm in highschool and recently I've come to the realization that I don't have any friendsI feel kind of weird for posting this because I don't want people to think that I'm being self-centered by doing so, but I have to let this out. I am seeking attention in a way tbh. However, it's because I have no one else to turn to about my feelings, and I just can't hold it all in anymore. 

I have always been the type that is very shy. When I was little my mom said I wouldn't even talk to them, so she had to put me in speech therapy. I've always been very shy at school too, but I did make friends. I have always had friends by my side. Now though I don't. I've grown apart from my childhood bestfriend and others, 1 of my friends moved away and I only have one person I talk to from school left. However, it's not to the point where we can hangout in person. She probably doesn't want to anyways because we have known each other  for a couple years, and it has never gotten to the hanging out phase. I also have a couple people other people I talked to at school, but I don't have any of their social medias or anything. 
It just hurts seeing my sister have fun with her friends while I'm just at home. She always does phone calls with them, and whenever it's at night I sit through hearing the whole thing and getting in a bad mood because I don't have anyone I can call. I do have family, but family is suppose to like you. Also it's not the same as having a friend that chooses you because they are interested in you. 

I just want someone in my life who will be there for me and can hangout at the mall or a concert or just in my living room with me again. I've never admitted this to anyone, but I really want to let this out. When I was going to school in the morning this year everyone was talking to their close friends, and I didn't have any close friends. I didn't want to seem weird for standing somewhere alone, so I would wait to use the bathroom till I got into school so that I didn't have to deal with it. People probably saw me and thought I was weird for doing that, but either way there would have been judgement by others. I'd rather have less people see me by going into a bathroom then a bunch of students walking by me seeing me alone. 

My mental health is going down because of this. I can't do anything about it at the moment though because of the current pandemic with not having school or ways to meet others. I have tried online friends and I love them, but they are just not the same.

I hope you all are having a lovely day, and I'm here for you ????",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness because they explicitly state they do not have friends and feel isolated. they mention losing childhood friends, having only one person they talk to but not closely enough to hang out with, and feeling hurt seeing their sister having fun with her friends. they also describe their shyness and difficulty making new friends, which contributes to their sense of loneliness. they express a strong desire for someone to be there for them and share activities with, highlighting their need for companionship."
"I guessIt's partly the fact that I know my place in loneliness. I guess its partially that I'm aware of my part in making myself unapproachable. I guess it's the acknowledgement that I run from those who want me, that fact which makes me feel as if it cannot be my fault. As if the tears which I swallow every night are the result of some other person for whom I am not responsible. Or the decision of another unaffected by my opinion.

I suppose the most difficult part of moving forward is admitting it's my fault. That I get hung up on people. I don't allow myself to move on because I'm afraid of entering a relationship that will fail. It's me who pushed the people who liked me away, me who decided to stay home tonight instead of going out and me who took those steps towards self-destruction. 

This is not a prison inescapable through outward forces. It is not one manned by others or guarded by any. This is a prison powered solely through the individual, with bars of arrogance holding me within.

Everything is just about nonsense. You don't have to agree with me but I think it's the worst to be with people and feel the loneliness. That you don't understand others.

This is the one day a year where I think I shouldn't have to message people first for them to remember it's my birthday (close friends of course). Even a facebook post, since facebook alerts you to birthdays and I can tell they were on facebook today.

(i.e disagreeing with popular opinions, hating on popular things) In fact, I wanted to be the same as everyone else for so long. It wasn??t until recently that I??ve started to come to this realization. The problem with this is that because I??m so different, I don??t really have anyone to relate to.

"Night is the worstI have felt lonely most of my teen years and I still do. I am a 22M with depression since I was 15 yo.

I feel there is something wrong with me, like a curse. Everyone tends to forget me, stops talking to me at some point. Even though I have a girlfriend, I feel so lonely even when I am with her. She basically the only person I talk to outside my family. Lately I've started to zone out when I am with her. My mind just turns itself off. It's like I am stuck in some empty place.

At night this feeling of loneliness gets worst. From my house I can see all my town, and when I look through the windows I think I am nothing more than an ghost. I feel that if someday I go and become one with the dark night, when the sun rises next morning no one will have a single memory of me. Other times I wonder who will show up at my funeral.

There is no moon tonight. Each day the darkness calls grow stronger. I have taken different medications, I've tried different routines, tried to keep myself busy.... It never works. I may be stuck in the past, because I can't get over the fact that I lost a friend due to my untreated depression. I was a complicated case back then. I can't get over the fact that our relationship will be same as before.

Sometimes I text him, but I feel some weird energies, as if I am annoying him. To be truthful, I feel this way towards everyone. I just want to shut myself in, people always hurt me. I can't understand how relationships work, how one makes friends... My therapist says I am in the autism spectrum, but I am not autistic.

"It's been a while, loneliness fills my very core :|I haven't felt as lonely as I am now in a while. My ex called me crying about her current relationship. No we didn't try to get back together, I simply reminded her that this was going to happen and calmed her down until she fell asleep. But it reminded me of what I had. Having a bestfriend and a girlfriend all in one, was amazing. I've been dating around and making friends a long the way. As I heated up some soup and poured it in a bowl, I caught myself just staring into it. Thinking why should I eat this, why not just get drunk and forget! My soup is still sitting here and I just feel so alone.

Why are good people hard to come across? In the dating scene it feels that girls have lost intimacy and expect to be treated like a queen with no intention of treating you like a king. In the friendship world, even the closest people will stab you in the back if it'll benefit them. I still have my small little circle, but noone is available at the moment and it just hit me hard enough to post here after a while of not. 

I was watching the Amityville horror, and there was a scene where George was just lying on the dock and I never related so much to it. I just feel so weak to keep going...

I need friends that actually care about me",1,"the person feels like they are always the one maintaining friendships and expresses a desire to be cared for and checked up on. they mention feeling sad and needing friends who actually care about them, indicating feelings of loneliness and a lack of reciprocal emotional support in their relationships."
"First experience of lonelinessAfter realizing yesterday that I feel lonely first time, I started crying in the bed while trying to fall asleep in tears. Damn, that sucks. I also see my acquaintances throw party and my crush too. I hear these people talk and brag about their relationships, about how they experience the real love and so on. First what came to my mind is a scene from scrubs where JD talks about how lucky people are, someone who is relationship and have best friends to talk to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB17flDpPH0&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB17flDpPH0&amp;t=5s)  
I am really trying to stay strong and not let the loneliness ingrain my mind when I want to gtfo my country. Well, I guess it was too late after reading so many posts in this subreddit. Don't misunderstand me, I really love you guys for supporting and talking to each other. I hope you stand still when you have daily things to do. A big and warm hug to you guys ????????, peace.",1,"the narrative shows clear signs of feeling isolated and disconnected. the person describes crying alone in bed and feeling envious of others' relationships and social interactions. they mention trying to stay strong against loneliness and even express a desire to leave their country, indicating a deep sense of disconnection from their current environment. they also find some solace in online interactions but still feel the weight of their loneliness. this all points to a profound sense of loneliness."
"I really wish people around me cared moreI seem to have this constant thing of ??talk to me in school and stuff but never talk to me outside of school?? with everyone, like so many acquaintances but few real friends. However this year I??ve been questioning whether even those friends care since they too don??t contact me regularly. Except now that school is over I??ve barely heard from anyone. Not a whole lot of people even bothered to wish me a happy birthday and a few of the ??close?? friends weren??t even part of those that did, only like two, and I don??t think they would??ve known if not for me sending a meme on snap or through a shared birthday in a group chat of ours 

Another thing that happened recently: I would often rant on a spam insta account bc I don??t know who to even bother individually w my problems, so I just have to get them off my chest somehow. Well some of the ??close?? people unfollowed w no explanation bc they don??t like that I posted that stuff. Well why don??t you, idk, ask if I??m fucking ok??? If it??s that hard for you to see then why don??t you try to be there for me...anyways

And like idk I just wish I had someone that was checking in on me and I could talk about my day with and share banter and all that. I??ve tried to talk to people on internet and stuff but I can never keep it going or they just don??t respond, so idek if I??m looking for that. I just wish I could connect more with people near me I don??t know anymore if somethings fucking wrong w me or it??s everyone else but I??m just, I feel so alone",1,"the person feels isolated and lacks meaningful connections. they express a desire for deeper relationships and support but feel neglected by their peers. their experiences of being ignored or unfollowed on social media and the lack of consistent communication from friends contribute to their loneliness. they also mention difficulty in maintaining online conversations, furthering their sense of disconnection. overall, their narrative reflects feelings of being alone and unimportant to those around them."
"No friendsI don't have any real friends. No one texts me or calls me beside my family and some acquitances, but it really doesn't go deeper beyond a simple ""how are you"". I have realized that I have been all my life in a lockdown that the whole world is currently in. I have reached out in some friends subreddits here, but people just stop responding or talk to me about how they miss their life before the pandemic. It makes me feel even worse, because my life before the pandemic was exactly the same. I have also realized that I don't have any experience people my age should have.

I know it is my fault and there is no magic solution, because I don't trust people and making friends is very hard for me. I am tired of faking everything. I have no problem with talking to strangers or to my classmates, but when I do, it's like I have this happy mask on that has nothing to do with how I feel, I have no idea how to open up. I don't know how to have deep friendships, and that's what I want, not some fleeting relations. I am wondering about how to change this, because I don't want to spend all my life alone, without friends, without a partner or without family. 

I don't really know why am I posting this, just needed to share.",1,the person is experiencing profound loneliness they mention not having any real friends and only superficial interactions with acquaintances they feel isolated even before the pandemic and struggle to form deep connections they express a desire for meaningful relationships but find it difficult to trust and open up they also feel tired of pretending to be happy which indicates a deep sense of emotional isolation
"Feeling lonely while I am not actually aloneHi all,  


I have never actually talked openly about this so far and this makes me a bit nervous to do so as I don't really know how to explain it. But I feel like I need to.  


I have been feeling lonely for a good 10 years now. I am a person who works on himself, when I felt these feelings, I tried to connect it to my current situation and environment and thus my story.   


First I thought is having a relationship and that would fill the gap. I had a relationship for 4 years and it was fun and she was amazing but I eventually broke up with her. During this relationship I felt even more lonely. When your partner is fun and smart but you cannot connect on an emotional level, it doesn't work. I felt lost, I felt I was using her, I just felt that I was doing her wrong. I never cheated on her or anything but I just couldn't commit completely. So the best thing was to let her go.   


After that, nothing changed. I dated here and there. Had short relathionships but it lasted half a year or a year. I feel really bad and scared these last 2 year to try again. I cared for every girlfriend I had but left them all because I couldn't convince myself that it was the real thing. They all hate me for the fact I cannot commit. 3 years ago I realized I have never really loved anybody. How my friends describe love is something I have never ever felt. I have received it, but never been able to show it (hence the hate from my exes and I understand them and hope they will forgive me one day). They have moved on and I am genuinly happy for them. But envious as I haven't been able to move on fromt he same mindset I had when I was dating them.  


I have friends who I can call anytime of the day. I have loving family members. This was the reason I never thought that how I felt was an issue, because I believe I have it good. I feel blessed for my situation I am in but I cannot understand why I feel lonely.  


You can also not hurt me that easily. Insults I can take in like its nothing. I have a very sober mind for that and it works for me to stay calm and think rational. I always believed this was an advantage for me in live. But there was one thing my ex ones said to me in anger. She said ''you will never love anybody'' (calling me a cold person). This was 3 years ago and it is one of the few things that is hurting me till this day. I want to love somebody, really commit to her. But I really don't know how as I never saw someone and got the feeling ''yup thats it, she is the real deal''.   


I have connected me being lonely to love. I might be wrong but it is the thing I search for desperately when my lonely feelings get too much. I have done several things to try and fix my situation.  


\- I kept on dating to ''find the right one'' still felt lonely  
\- I learned new skills like playing the piano and just making music but didn't fill the gap  
\- I tried leaving my comfort zone by getting my skydive certificate while I am scared of doing it. Now I jump from planes and feel incredible (fear and adenaline really makes you feel alive) until I am in my bed the same night with my thoughts.  
\- I tried talking with my friends but they don't know it either  
\- I lived a year abroad (went alone) and made new friends new environment for myself. But this never helped either. Actually made me feel more lonely.  
\- Doing sports to build up convidence and try to love myself.

These feelings, I have put away for years. I always thought I am exagerating and in time it will be okay. But for the first time in my life, I really don't know what I should do. It keeps me awake at nights. Some friends tell me that I should be lucky that I don't feel that much as love hurts. But I would do anything to be blindly in love for once. Let my guard down and just go for it. Let my emotions take the wheel.   


I am not sure if I am making any sense with what I have written. I wouldn't make this post if I saw someone else with the same issue. But I see posts with problems that are worse than mine with people actually being alone as well, so I actually feel a bit ashamed posting this.   


If anybody has some insight on this or an opinion, I would love to hear it. Maybe something that have worked for you to find love. To learn to love yourself maybe? That is a whole another issue as well but my post got way too long to talk about self love.   


And if you think I shouldn't complain that much, let me know as well. I appreciate any perspective.  


Cheers.",1,"the person is lonely because they explicitly mention feeling lonely for a good 10 years despite having relationships and friends. they struggle with emotional connection and self-love, leading to persistent feelings of loneliness. they have tried various activities and changes in their life to address this but have not found a solution, indicating a deep-rooted sense of loneliness."

I??d rather be lonely than have fake friendsThis past week this ??friend?? got on my case cause I removed this ??friend?? from Snapchat. I removed the person because I was always the one sending the first text and it was never the other way around. Anyway the person kept asking me why I removed her from Snap and I told her that I know she never really cared about me (the person I removed was popular). She kept telling me she did but I know she doesn??t because she could??ve messaged me on any other platform but she never did.

"Does anyone else have insomnia, really bad stress dreams, and once in a while sleep paralysis due to loneliness?In the past year or so, my lifelong battle with loneliness has really started to affect me, partly when it comes to sleeping. I find there are many nights the soul-crushing isolation I feel 24/7 just creeps into my mind in really sharp focus, and it takes me hours to finally get to sleep. When I do sleep, I either wake up constantly throughout the night, or I've been having the worst nightmares I've ever had in my life, which have even led to episodes of sleep paralysis where I'll wake up and see some horrifying shadowy figure standing in my room.

Like, last night I went to bed feeling particularly down, and I had a dream where for some reason I was sleeping in this big Victorian mansion, and through the doorway of the bedroom, I kept seeing this tall, skinny entity racing in and out of the shadows of the hallway, which was dimly lit by moonlight. At one point it finally showed up in my room, and I ducked under the covers in the childlike belief that blankets were some sort of magic force field against the monster in the closet. Turns out the weren't, because whatever the thing was pulled the blankets right off of me, and I started feeling this intense pressure on me like someone had turned up the gravity by 100. The best I can describe the creature was kind of like the twisted humans from the managa The Horror of Amigara Fault by Junji Ito, the ""DRR DRR DRR"" things, only it was way worse somehow. I remember trying over and over to scream but no sound came out, and even in my dream I was thinking ""WAKE UP! WAKE UP!""

Finally, I did wake up, only for that dream demon to actually be standing over me, and I was feeling a pressure on my body, and I was trying to scream except it was more of a low closed-mouth humming sound. After about 5 seconds that felt like 5 minutes, it stopped, and instantly the first thoughts that flooded into my head, as it always does when things like this happen, was ""If I had a social life and I was happy this wouldn't be happening.""",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness which is significantly impacting their mental health and sleep patterns. they describe feelings of soul-crushing isolation and how it affects their ability to sleep, leading to insomnia, stress dreams, and sleep paralysis. the narrative clearly indicates that their loneliness is a central issue contributing to their distress and sleep disturbances."

"Go from being fine/ok to being so sadI was literally having an ok day, and then the second I decide to go off my phone for a few minutes is when I got hit with the sudden re-realization that I am very much lonely. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. Not even just to vent to, but to have an actual conversation with. Whether meaningful or meaningless. I don't even have a pet like a lot of other people in my same situation do. You can only rely on online ""friends"" for so long until they or you become bored of one another. Then you're on to the next and they cycle continues. 

It's not even the fact that I am lonely,  it's the fact that I'm not even capable of changing situation. Having social anxiety and also being an introvert is not exactly the best traits to have when pursuing any kind of relationship. Plus I don't live close to the school I go to, so all the people that could be possible friend-material don't live near me.  (Its summer break FYI)

I have no one to make my life even remotely more interesting. I'm tired of living the same day over and over again. Sleep, eat, workout, repeat.  

I know people will say, ""only you can make yourself happy"" well ok, I guess?  But wouldn't having another good person in your life help? Idk. I wouldn't know.

Most of them came in a already formed groups and did things within those groups. We collected trash together but I felt disconnected and out of place. Besides few ""hi""-s and general comments about the trash no one bothered to talk much. Being in these situations makes me even more lonely because it becomes apparent how disconnected and alone I really am.

"You think your life is sh**? (READ MY STORY)Everything started in my third year of highschool, I was moved to another college (A better one, according to my parents decision). Before that, I was a normal kid, with some good friends in school. I lived with my both parents (I don't have brothers or sisters), had a nice dog, and everything else a kid needs to be good. We were a very happy family.

When highschool started, I was bullied by my other classmates with no reason. I was beaten by other guys twice, some others put some photos of me on the internet (To make fun of me), and a random dude thretened me with dead, just because I was new on that school.  
This situation lasted about six months, six months of crying everytime I arrived home, and waking up the next day was a hell for me. My parents noticed that I wasn't alright and they decided to take me out from there when I told them what was really going on. They  informed the situation to the college and I coun't finish the schoolyear.

One day I was walking back to my house and I was attacked by seven random dudes on the Street (They knew me from that god damn school) and they sent me to the hospital with a lot of cuts in my body and contusions.  
My parents freaked out, and they seemed very worried about my condition, so when I healed my wounds, they took me to psycologycal therapy so I can have some psychological support.

The theraphy was great, It lasted about one year and half, I had to took some medication to avoid developing depression and phobias.  
I started to feel better everyday, and my fear to walk on the streets started to dissapear, so I decided to finish my highschool in a adult education program. (I was still dealing with the attack I suffered and the damage that bullying can cause, but I made a huge effort to move on with my life)  
When everyting seemed to take a normal path in my life, my parents got divorced, so I had to move with my mother to another house where I wasn't allowed to see my dad.

I got very depressed about it, and started to feel alone and insecure because my mother changed a lot, she was never in the house. She worked all day, and in the nights she used to hang out with her new Friends.  
My father always called me to know what was going on, and we meet every saturday to hang out, have some pizza, or just talk about anything. He was the only one who was worried about me, but I wasn't allowed to see him during the week.

My mother started to hang out and getting drunk in the nights very often, and one day I find out she was spending all her money on the casino, so we were broken.  
One day she left me alone in the house to never came back. (She moved with her parents without saying a word)

When my father knew what was going on, he was very angry with my mother, so he took me to live with him and his mother (I was never close to my grandma, so this was a very umconfortable situation to me). But I was very thankfully to be with my dad.

After a long time being alone and kind of sad, I met some new friends, so things started to go well... The most important thing about this time was that, I met ""Caroline"", she was my first girlfiend. Caroline was very nice with me, we had great time togheter hanging out, watching movies, and she was very important to me in every sense, even more because I think she helped me a lot to move on my pain about my parents divorce, and my mother's runaway.

But Caroline didn't know how to stay on a relationship, after three years i discovered she cheated on me many times, (Not with a single guy, with a lot of them) I was very hurt, because I put all my trust on her and she failed me. She asked for forgiveness, but everytime I did, she screw it all again and again.  
I refused to dump her out, because I was in love with her, and I always thought that she could change, but NO, she never did. So after that 3 years  I decided to put an end to it.

Since we break up, Caroline stalked me in my workplace, in my house, she stalked my friends too. She even went to see my dad crying one time because she missed me, and my dad loved her as a daughter so he always tried to fix up everything between us, but I didn't want to see her again to be honest.

As she stalked me everywhere I go, her parents tought that I was still with her, and I was encouraged many times by them, threating to put a demand on me because I was a bad influence for her and I was damaging her feelings. (WTF!!) It seemed that no one else could see the pain I was groing through, I mean... she was my girlfrend and I loved her more tan anything in the world.

Well?? I moved on with my life, Caroline was put on a mental health insitutiion because she was diagnosed with depression after the break and then was moved to another city. After two years from that we both started university but we did not heard about each other anymore. (So I was single in that two Years)

My father was very happy because I got in university, and I was very happy too, I loved my career, my new classmates, my teachers were great, actually I started a band! and everything was great finally!Thats when my mother appeared again, she was very sorry about her behavior but she was happy for me to live with my dad because she knew he loved me and we were very Good Friends.

In the first year of university I knew a girl called ""Javiera"", we started to hang out for months until we started a relationship. She was very nice too, very intelligent, maybe more childish than Caroline in some aspects, but I enjoyed my time with her a lot anyways.

Javiera was very jealous, she thought every girl in the world wanted to fuck me... With the time she  started to change her behavior, She freaked out about anything, and left me alone a lot of times for stupid reasons. So I thought?? ""I will not fight her as I done with Caroline, I Will remain calm and talk with her"", but it was worse, because she got very violent increasingly until one day she got mad with me and jumped in her ex boyfriend car in front of me all my Friends/classmates. (I got very very ashamed)

I felt how my hate on life and people was growing bigger, but I didn't explode, because I can always count with my father and my band mates.

In the morning of 30 August 2018 I woke up as usual, and I went to my father's bedroom to wake him up for breakfast, but I found him dead in his bed. He was pale, cold, he had a heart attack?? I NEVER SAW SOMEONE DEAD BEFORE! I WAS SHOCKED!!!!

After the ambulance came to the house I called my fiends and mom to tell them what happened.  
It was the worst day of my life by far...  
That's when my life changed 200% I was very sad and angry with life, with god, with myself, with my mother, with everyone. The first two weeks I couldn't sleep well, had nightmares, cried every night,.  
My aunt paid for the funeral while I got the money to give her back, because as a family (my grandmother and me) was complety broken. The money I got paid in my workplace wasn't enoigh to pay for the funeral.

My grandmother left me alone in the house for two weeks, she traveled to the beach with some other family members, and the loneliness started to take over me... I started to fl paraoind and crazy about anything, because I had enough time and silence to overthink about the highschool, my mother, Caroline, Javiera, and now my dead father?? HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO SUFFER!? WHAT DO LIFE WANT FROM ME???

When my grandma got back from the beach she were very indifferent with me, she didn't talk to me, or anything. And one day when I came back to the house I found all my clothes in the street. Yes... she trowed me out the house. When I got inside, she started to yell me out  because she needed money to pay the rent and other taxes that my father used to pay and I didn't have it.

My mother helped me to take all my stuff and came back to the house we had with my parents,  but it was avery difficult task, because  we were attacked by my grandma and my uncle who also called the cops saying that I was stealing things from her house. MY OWN THINGSS!!!!!!!!

In this point, all my friends dissapeared, they were always busy, or didn't have time to hang out, or maybe have a cup of coffee?? I don't know why but seriously, they all DISSAPEARED.  
But HEY!!! I wasn't all alone, my band's drummer was always calling me, TO BORROW SOME MONEY FROM ME... or what about the other guitarist? YEAH! he called me too, but oh surprise, he needed a favor. -.-

I started to live by my own then, my mother visited me often, but I was all alone, and now with my whole family against me and dealing with the grief of my father.  
I started to develop a huge depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, and being by my own wasn't very helpful.

That summer Caroline appeared in my house, she learned about my father's death. So she was very close to me all that time. I thought she came back to support me as a friend, but she wanted to be with me as something more. (I know i was very stupid to let her got in my life, but I felt defenceless and the only thing I wanted was someone who showed me some love). So I accepted?? and I feel like I was in the sky, It was better this time, because she appeared in the worst moment of my life.

We spent time togheter doing the things we used to do when we were younger, and we were very happy, more tan the first time...  
One day I noticed something strange on her IG account?? there was someone who commented her pictures as he was her boyfriend??? And the comments were from weeks ago.  
Someday, Caroline texted me saying that she didn't want to be with me anymore. NOTHING MORE.  
And then I find out she had a boyfriend ALL THIS YEARS. They broke up, so Caroline came here to my house, and when they fixed things up, she came back to his boyfriend :)

In 20th August 2019 after a show with my band I tried to kill myself in the bathroom, because I didn't stand my depression, my mind was very noisy, I was vomitting everyday because of the anxiety, my hands were always shaking and my visi??n was blurry, but after hours thinking and looking at myself at the mirror I called my mom and she saved me from doing it.

The next day I came back to my house, but again, I was all alone...  
That's when my drummer's girlfriend showed up to cheer me out. YES! her girlfriend, not him. Why??? He was my friend, not her.  
But the thing is that she started to call me every night to ask me how I was, so I trusted her my feelings, what I was thinking, I told her how anxiety or depression feels like, and she always threated me as I was the most interesting person in the world, no matter how fucked i was.

One day she called me to tell me that her boyfriend (my band's drummer) left the city to live in another state for work, (They will have a distance relationship) She was very sad about it, but I tried to cheer her up as she done with me before.  
We talked for months, and she was very special for me, because she was the only one to convice me to see my dad at the cemetery.  
One day she came to my house at 10pm like a suprise. But she was a little nervous, I asked her what was going on and then  she told me that she was in love with me and she didn't love her boyfriend.  
I told her that she must be just confused, and we wll never have anything as a relationship.

She understood the situation, but she never tried to get away from me. Actually she was keep calling me everyday, or inviting me to a coffee.  
One day we were on my house, and we kissed each other. I felt something very powerful going on trough my veins, It was adrenaline and she felt it too.  
How can I do this?? HE IS MY FRIEND? but... is he??? He just call me to ask for money or favors, and everytime i tried to talk to him he was busy.

So long story short, we were hanging out and having sex for four months and we never told my friend. And do you know what? I didn't feel guilty at all. She didn't too.  
I believe in karma but karma is indebted to me. Always bad things happen to me without doing anything, everyone passes me by  and no one cares a fuck about me. So I started living and caring just about myself. I think about telling my friend the truth in many times, but I thought It was like betraying her, and was that a good thing? After all she was the only one who was caring about me.

This girl was in suffer, because she wanted to be with me, but she didn't know how to dump her boyfriend without breaking up my band, or her financial stability that he provided her (In her own words) and in the other hand I wasn't offering anything safe to her, because now I just care about myself.

So one day, she didn't stand it anymore and she told him everything. But, she told that I was stalking her, sending her texts and calling her everyday. When i find out she betrayed me, I tried to speak with her, but she blocked me. So the next day my band's drummer came to my house with two guys to beat me up. As the new person I became, I didn't hesitate, I pulled out my gun (Yes, I bought a gun.. Am I becoming BAD?) And I pointed it right into his forehead, and I told him to go and never came back.

The next day the police came to my house because he told them that I tried to kill him so now I have a charge for death threat.

That's how my life became what it is now.

This isn??t our first time we??ve broken up, so many stupid little arguments that has led up to a ??breakup??. At this point I??m more confused then anything, I started it. I planted this seed of just confusion for myself and my ex. I don??t even know if I should call him that, he told me he??d come over later today and we??d talk about it. We??d come up with something, but he promised. We had something sacred to our relationship and I fucking blew it. I told him hurtful things so I know this is what I deserve. We pushed each other away, it??s just hard. He said he??s exhausted, he doesn??t have the energy to continue trying anymore. I??m lost, lost in my emotions. Lost in sorrow. I found a note I wrote awhile back that I??m going to give him, it basically explains my feelings right now. I know I should have seen this coming I chose to ignore the warning signs.

"Extreme Independence is a trauma responseI(36M) read this somewhere and I was blown away. I have been living alone since last 5 years. I have a stable job and I??m financially independent with my own house. 

When I read this post somewhere on social media it made me reflect upon my life. The society where I come from isn??t very much open about mental health. I have had a very normal childhood or as I would like to believe but that wasn??t the case, I now realise. I was neglected by my parents because they were too entangled in their own lives and perhaps struggling to exist with their own traumas. My father was rarely present because he was too busy arranging livelihood for all of us. 

However, I did not learn to handle basic emotions. I was too reserved which was often mistaken as shy. I had no boundaries when it came to have friendships or relationships with other people. I worked under covert emotional contracts which did not work out too well for me. All my 20s I was in and out of traumatising relationships which always ended badly. When I got married in my late 20s, it ended up in divorce in 6 months. 

Now I live alone. I find people intolerable. I don??t like to hangout with anyone, it drains my energy. I kept telling myself that the only way to be safe and have no drama in life is to cut away people and that??s what I have done now. And I thought it was working for me.

"It Feels Like I've Become Feral During the PandemicSome context: 

I've always felt lonely, even in the presence of others (longtime friends, my partner, coworkers I get on with), but it never bothered me all that much. When I moved to Denver back in 2011, I didn't make a huge group of new friends, but we still got along, hung out, and still talk and support one another to this day. I moved back to my hometown in 2017 and reconnected with old friends and, to my surprise, made plenty of new friends at work. I'd host cookouts, or have people over for game night, or do activities with all of these people quite regularly.

Then, thinking I was helping a friend, I ended up in Montana knowing only my partner and this aforementioned friend. This friend needed roommates in order to stay in this town to finish their degree and my partner and I wanted to get out of our hometown (I also lost a friend at the same time this discussion was had and my grief-stricken mind thought I needed to get as far away as possible). A few weeks before our move date, the friend informed us she'd gotten into a program in a town four hours away and would only be with us for three months. I figured, okay, that's enough time to meet people and find my group and she promised to introduce my partner and I to people who we might get along with.

Fast forward to being in Montana and I hardly saw this friend the three months she was living with us, the cooking and cleaning responsibilities fell mostly on me, and the friends she had barely spoke to me or my partner when they came over. My partner and I are polyamorous, so we did try dating new people at first but no one really was a good fit for us - our circle stayed small.

Pre-pandemic, I made about four or five new friends, but I only really see two of them frequently since I usually hang out to smoke weed with them and just shoot the shit. The other three are significantly busier (nanny, promoter, drummer for a band), but we do have fun the few times we see one another.

The friend who initially brought me to Montana would come to visit, but I always got the vibe she only wanted to hang out because it was a guaranteed couch to sleep on. If we went to a concert or got breakfast with her friends, I always felt like the odd duck out of the conversations, even being ignored for the entirety of a concert/night on the town where I literally left the show for over an hour to play Pok??mon Go and no one noticed until the house lights came up. Afterwards, her and her group wanted to go to a bar where I was ignored again and just went to the car to listen to a podcast for an hour before they noticed I'd left again. We haven't spoken since that night.

Okay, now that that's out of the way -

I quit my job back in April. I was financially stable enough to take some time off and recover from the burnout the pandemic had brought on. During that time, I saw my partner and the two friends I hang out with regularly fairly regularly, but not as frequently. I also ended up with a decent amount of mushrooms, which was great, but also gave me the mental space to reflect on how depressed I was and how isolated I felt out here. Towards the middle of my time away from work and interacting with people, I ended up doing some amphetamines (insuffilated) and having a period of time where I wanted to socialize but couldn't really go out to places where people gathered. After coming down from that binge, I had a period of feeling unmotivated and more misanthropic than usual.

Finally, I decided to look for work and ended up getting a job a few weeks ago. I genuinely love the work (small kitchen where I'm one of four cooks inside of a grocery store) and I appreciate that it gives me a sense of purpose after spending two years working at a gas station.

However, I feel like mentally, I'm just not ready to interact with large groups of people, having to remember faces and names, trying to play the work politic game. My manager is friendly and we've had nice, quick conversations about bicycles and food, and one of the cooks I've worked with is a genuinely nice person, but we don't have much in common aside from the fact we both smoke weed and take psychedelics.

For the most part, anytime I speak up at work, it's work-related and nowhere near that level of comfort I had talking to new people in Denver or back in Texas. I spend my lunch break alone mostly to avoid the crowds at the store (I'm vaxxed, but still try to distance as often as I can), which doesn't bother me, but I know that probably means I'm not going to interact much with my other coworkers. Every day after work, I come home and have vented to my partner about how isolated I feel on the job.

Maybe it's just my brain not working right, or maybe it's just that breaking in period at a new job. I seriously considered looking for a new job today, even though I know I wouldn't be paid as well or enjoy the hours as much. I'm mostly just venting because I don't want to burden my partner with this when they feel just as isolated, so I figured why not just scream into the void and get this off my chest. I just want to be able to talk to people like I used to, but I feel like something broke inside of me during the pandemic and I'll never get it back.",1,"the person describes a persistent sense of isolation and loneliness despite having social interactions and a partner. they mention feeling isolated even before the pandemic, struggling to connect with new people in montana, and feeling ignored by the friend who initially brought them there. their social circle is small, and they express a deep sense of depression and isolation, particularly exacerbated by the pandemic and their recent job experiences. this indicates a profound sense of loneliness that is affecting their mental well-being."
"The weight of the loneliness has gotten too much and I can??t do this anymore41 days ago I deleted all social media because I couldn??t cope seeing someone I loved with someone that??s not me (toxic af I know). I think it was because she was my only chance at not feeling lonely so when she left there was nobody else, she was it. I haven??t spoken to someone that isn??t close family or a stranger on the internet since August. She was the last person I spoke too. Deep down I??m so happy for her, but I??m sad for myself. She was the only person who ever ??got?? me and I don??t think I will ever find anyone else that does. I don??t know or understand how to connect with people, I have no idea how to make friends or reconnect with old friends. I don??t think that I will ever have anyone again whether it be a friend or a relationship. I logged on Instagram today to see the post that I was dreading, I was dreading it because it signified the end of mine and hers chapter for good, that??s it and there no coming back from it. I think I would be completely okay with it if I had other people but I don??t, I have no one.I don??t blame her, I??m not bitter or angry with her just at myself for letting it get to this point where she was my only way out of loneliness. I knew it would never happen but let myself believe it because I was so desperate for something or someone.
I haven??t had a hug in nearly two years now, I just want to be held, I just want to feel loved, I want to feel worthy of love. I want someone to love and care for me the way I do them.In the last couple of days I??ve come to accept that this will never happen and that it??s time to give up on that dream because I??m only delaying the inevitable.

Within the next few weeks I will more than likely take my own life, I can??t cope with the crushing loneliness anymore I can??t deal with the pain. I??ve not been on this planet long but after trying for 4 years I now accept that this isn??t going to get any better and it??s time to let go.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness due to the loss of a significant relationship. they express feelings of isolation, an inability to connect with others, and a lack of social support. the narrative reveals a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, indicating that the individual feels they have no one to turn to for emotional support. their struggle with loneliness is exacerbated by their belief that they will never find anyone who understands or loves them as their former partner did. this overwhelming sense of loneliness has led them to contemplate taking their own life."
"i thought i got what i wantedmy now boyfriend asked me to date him shortly after valentine's day which felt awesome. but now that it's been a while, i... still feel as lonely as ever. perhaps i overestimated my ability to handle long distance (we live like 4 states away from reach other) and it probably doesn't help that throughout all this time we haven't really talked like close people do, like about ourselves or about our days or anything... i don't feel any closer to him than i did in february. it has me confused about my true feelings for him... but anyway, all this to say that sometimes i catch myself thinking ""i wish i has a boyfriend"" but remembering that i do. it's confusing and it makes me so sad.",1,the person feels lonely because despite being in a relationship they do not feel emotionally connected to their partner. the long distance and lack of meaningful communication contribute to their sense of isolation and confusion about their feelings.

"Thanks to homeschool, I've been isolated for most of my childhoodSo I just need to vent right now because Im just so fucking pissed. I don't even know if anyone is going to see this but here goes

I'm 15M and when I was 7 my parents took me out of the private religious school they sent me and decided to ""homeschool""

Since then I've barely been around kids my own age, I've never had anyone I could call a friend (other than online, god I feel so pathetic having to add that) I've missed out on so many experiences that other teens my age have all had. I hate that I can't relate to anyone and I've got no god damn social skills. I love sports but I've barely done them because every place had to follow my dad's strict religious requirements

I've really only studied three subjects (English Maths and Science) and I'm behind on all of them which makes me feel so inferior and insecure

The only plus is I guess I've gotten used to the loneliness, can't miss something you've never had, right? Though sometimes I wonder what my life could've been like if I was normal. I wonder what it would be like to have friends, to go partys, to be around girls. Maybe I'm being dramatic but I feel like my childhood has been stolen from me.

"I tried to open up but I regret it...I've moved a lot throughout my life, but then came a time when I stayed at one place for about 10 11 years... Made a lot of friends, built good relationships with people.

Then last year I had to move again to a completely new country for my education. I had to leave everything behind, my family, my friends, everyone... I moved with one of my best friends that I've known for about 6 years, I felt a little better knowing that there was someone with me on this journey.

I was adjusting to the new environment i was in, trying to socialize with new people in my highschool, build new connections. Then some shit happened between me and my best friend and we stopped talking with each other, and all the people I've been talking to trying to socialize with took his side, which ultimately left me alone.

This happened a couple weeks before quarantine, and things weren't getting any better at all. I stopped communicating with anyone, i was basically the quiet kid that you know nothing about in the classroom. Then came quarantine and from that time until now I have been sitting home all day, either playing call of duty or studying...

I moved again for my senior year to another area and school, i was both relived and stressed at the same time... I got to have a clean slate, again. But I don't know anyone and nobody knows me... Senior year has been online mostly and things haven't changed since junior year... I started getting social anxiety whenever i leave the house to buy groceries, limiting any kind of interaction with anybody.

Yesterday I told myself, enough... I have to try opening up and trying to talk to people. I heard about this app called Yubo that connects you to people around you in the area to chat with. So I went ahead download the app, setup an account, and there you have it... Dozens of people I can possibly talk to, dozens of possible friends you can make.

I clicked on a random stream with two girls and a guy, they were welcoming at first. The guy was flirting with the girls in a sexual way and wanted me to join in, I dodged his invitation in an attempt to have a normal conversation. He then went to my bio and started making fun of how I look, what I like, etc. I usually don't take criticism like this seriously, I laugh it off and move on. But this time the girls he was flirting with joined in to mock me. He then told me to leave the chat room and banned me from entering it.

After that moment I went ahead and deleted both the account and the app, then told myself ""never again""... Lately I feel rejected by society, by my family, all the people I've known throughout my life. And every morning I wake up to question my existence.",1,"the person feels lonely because they have experienced significant social isolation and rejection. they moved to a new country, lost their best friend, and struggled to form new connections. their attempts to socialize have been met with mockery and exclusion, leading to feelings of rejection and questioning their existence. their narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and disconnection from others."
"feeling empty and hollowI feel as if I??m lacking something in my life, things like human interaction and a feeling of belonging and love, a girlfriend. Although when I??m around others I??m shown that I??m not missing much. People tend to want to get drunk and high and stand around talking about themselves and trying to one up one another. Maybe it??s the people who I surround myself with, but I didn??t know they??d end up like this, since I??ve known them since middle school. But even now that I??m in college on my own in this dorm an hour away from home I haven??t made a decent connection either. It??s really hard to find someone who is actually interested in talking to me, or actually remember anything about me afterwards. I start to wonder if something is actually wrong with me or something, if I??m so strange that I repel others, but that??s just what my anxiety tells me in my darkest hours. As I get older I??ve learned that not everyone is going to get along and that there??s no such thing as being too strange or weird, everyone is their own person. I guess that my problem stemmed from social media, before I had that I was blissful and content with my life. I became envious of others watching them show their best selves. I??m starting to learn that people are just people who probably feel the same way as I, they just don??t show it, and my envy comes from me imagining that they live a life without problems as well. Although not everyone has as many things to be upset about as others. I overthink everything... maybe that??s why no one wants to talk to me?",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of emptiness and longing for meaningful human interaction and connection. the person feels isolated and struggles to form genuine relationships, both with old friends and new acquaintances. their anxiety and overthinking further contribute to their feelings of being different and unworthy of others' attention. this all points to a profound sense of loneliness"

"Highschool SucksI don't even know what to write. My mind is just racing with thoughts and I can't figure out what to put on here. I'm not even motivated enough to go through with writing this. I'm tired. What's the point?

I am a freshman in high school, and I'm around 3 months from ""graduation"" (or becoming a Sophomore, not that that matters or whatever because I'm still going to be the depressed nobody I am). Nearly every single person has a boyfriend/girlfriend and a social life, but then I'm over here lonely and depressed almost every single day. It hurts. No matter how hard I try to converse, people always scrub me aside because they have more important people to worry about. Who could blame them? I'm just a depressed teenager with nothing going on with their life. What's the point of going on?

Every day during lunch I'll sit at a table with my ""friend"", or classmate acquaintances, who probably will forget the fact that I exist the moment the dismissal bell rings. I never have someone who I can just relate to and converse with whenever I want to. After all, I'm not important, right?

I can't even talk to my family about this because I'm too embarrassed. I know they don't care. ""Stop being a baby and make friends"". Yeah, not so easy when you're sad about all the bullshit and scared all the time. What's the point of telling them if all that I'll do is make shit worse. All that will happen is they'll punish me and give me a lecture.

What do I do? Oh, and don't give me that bullshit saying ""oh, it'll get better"" because it probably won't. Not at the rate I'm going anyway. Don't suggest that I flush money to a therapist also.

I've had imaginary relationships. I guess I liked the hope I felt, that somehow there was this version of me that got the girl. The real life me just can't connect at all.

"Upside DownOn monday my whole life flipped upside down, I headed to my parents for three days leaving behind my boyfriend, my apartment and my dog.

He said that he cant try anymore, he says that he loves me but if we met 5 years later it would of worked but right now it just cant. We have 2 months to move everything out and I cant bare to be at the apartment. I miss my dog and hes trying to let me see her but I know it's hard for him to also see me (likewise). I just wish things were fixable, I keep thinking that this is just some sick dream that I'll wake up from. Where do I go from here? I isolated myself when I was with him because he was my bestfriend and i honestly thought i didnt need anyone else. Now I'm 23, living at my parents with an apartment im still paying for even though neither of us can stay there because it hurts. I've been having a lot of job interviews and I'm hoping that once I get something permanent than it can atleast take my mind off things but as of now I just feel like a loner and a huge disappointment. This isn't what I thought my life would become.. I thought I was going to marry this man.. I still think that we could.

So to all those out there tonight, looking through reddit to see similar people, in similar situations hoping to find something to make them feel better just know.... I'm with you. It hurts.

"I just spent over $200 on various dating apps and websites due to my lonlinessOver the past year and a half or so, I (23 M) have been living in a city that is absolutely terrible for my dating life. It's frustrating because I have seen myself do better in other areas like college towns and bigger cities. However, where I currently reside, I am not marketable. I have only been on 2 honest dates with one woman here, but that is far outnumbered by the amount of times I have had to pay for dates in this area. I recently binged and bought subscriptions to various dating apps including Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and Ashley Madison (I am single and am not looking to homewreck, though), totaling at well over $200.

I don't know what's worse: the fact that this is not the first time I've done this in the past year, the fact that I can only find companionship in this area if I pay for it, or the fact that I know that I just wasted money because I know from experience that throwing money at the situation in this area doesn't help in the slightest.

Relying on myself to fix it usually gets it done but today well it's not getting better it's just a constant state of I guess I'm alright or nvm I'll be fine sorry for bothering you. I'm going over how I can help ease it myself because well that's the only person who's really never left, given up on me, or understands at this point. It's just so exhausting, putting on a face for people when I all I do after work is game, cry or go to the gym to fix myself for the next day. I fear I'm going to die alone not by my own hand but just in the end and that makes me hate myself a bit for fearing something so trivial I feel. I'm sorry I wish I was better so I didn't have to burden any strangers on the internet to take a crack at helping me.",1,the person is experiencing loneliness as they express feelings of isolation and a lack of meaningful connections they mention feeling upset about being alone and the desire for someone to help them emotionally they also describe the exhaustion of maintaining a facade and the fear of dying alone these sentiments indicate a deep sense of loneliness
Its my birthday... but there's no one with me.I have been living alone since last month. this city is under lockdown. covid going crazy. do have few friends that used to come by on weekends to watch some sports. but now even that sports got cancelled. I have been feeling lonely since months before when covid thigh hit the globe. its my birthday today and alone. did got some happy bday messages. idk what am i supposed to do. there is just nobody for me. and it sucks even to think of it. sorry this is just an another throwaway account.,1,"the person is experiencing loneliness because they mention being alone on their birthday, living alone, the impact of covid lockdowns, and the absence of friends who used to visit. they express feelings of loneliness and despair, indicating a deep sense of isolation."

"What does a genuine friendship feels like?I always call her my best friend but I realise she has never said the same about me. She always takes hours, if not days, to reply my texts. Sometimes I see her replying in group chats instantaneously and wonder why she couldn??t do the same for me. At times when I??m feeling upset and needed her advice, she still took hours to reply back and didn??t seem to care much. 

Other friends that I have - we are more like acquaintances because we only meet every few months and I could feel that we are on different wavelengths and I can??t truly be myself around them. 

Maybe I expected too much from my friendships but I can??t help it - I don??t feel loved at all and most of the time it??s really just me against the world. 

Would really appreciate if anyone has advice :(",1,"the person feels lonely because they express a sense of unreciprocated friendship and emotional neglect. they feel that their best friend does not prioritize them and other friends are more like acquaintances, leading to a feeling of isolation and lack of genuine connection. they also mention feeling unloved and alone, reinforcing their loneliness."

I don't know how to peopleI don't even know how to do this anymore. I just don't know how to converse with people and progress things to hanging out after work or making friends. I always struggled with it in my home country but since moving to the States I'm struggling even more. I feel like no one gets me...I was never the funny guy in England but I'd still get some laughs. I get nothing in America...I just feel so boring and dull. I've been here almost two years and I still feel like an outcast.,1,"the person is experiencing significant difficulties in social interactions and forming connections, both in their home country and even more so after moving to a new country. they express feelings of being misunderstood, boring, and dull, and describe themselves as an outcast, indicating a deep sense of loneliness and isolation."
"A Legacy of LonelinessI??m sure many of you here can relate to this. My entire life has been and endless cycle of getting my hopes up, being rejected, and falling into loneliness. People seem to enjoy my company for the most part, but I??m never anyone??s first priority. I don??t get invited to anything by anyone or have many interactions outside of school. From the fourth grade to the tenth grade, I??d always try to hang around groups of people at lunch period, futilely attempting to force myself into the group. While I may have spent my time with these people, I was never really part of the group or considered to be by the people of it. I always had one friend who was one of the ??popular kids?? who has since changed schools and really shown a lack of interest in me. He was the one person I could always rely on to be around with at lunch time, and now that he left, I really have nothing. This was the final nail in the coffin. I??ve tried to force my way into too many groups, and I??ve since quit trying. Every new school year I would tell myself, ??This year people will like you and you??ll have lots of friends??. However, when I went into the eleventh grade, I already had accepted that no group would include me. So, I spent my entire eleventh grade hanging around my new best friend: my locker. I??m honestly a person people enjoy being around and I can make people laugh but no one seems to really care about that or about anything that has to do with me. As for the romantic side of my loneliness, there have been four women who I have had a particular fondness for. As you can probably guess, they all rejected me. All of these women showed at some point an interest in me, but ended up rejecting me in the end. I??m not the type of person to like many women, I really only develop a fondness for a select few. Of course I??m attracted to many women, but not in ways where I??d want to really be in serious relationships with them. However, every time I attempt to have a relationship with a woman, I get rejected. I??ve been told that I have to learn to love myself before I love others but that is not the issue. I am by no means depressed; I??m not the type of person to get depressed. In fact, I really do love myself and I??m the best friend I??ll ever have. The issue is that no one seems to love me. I honestly despise the human need for relationship. If I could not have to worry about creating relationships, my life would be a lot easier. But, this loneliness I??ve experienced my entire life eats away at my core. I??ve just experienced my fourth rejection from a woman I grew very fond of, and it feels like she??s ripped out the last piece of my heart I had to give out to someone. I??ve given out my heart, but received none back. This has left me empty inside, like a hole developed in my stomach. Before this most recent rejection, I can??t remember the last time I had cried from emotional or physical pain. It??s not that I was holding it in, I just really am not the person who cries a lot. Recently, I??ve been crying a lot more, and have accepted that I will likely not find many people, or anyone, who I will have a meaningful relationship with. As I enter my last year of high school, I am immensely excited to leave for University and meet a fresh new set of people. I can only pray that someone there has a connection with me and we can grow a relationship. Humans are humans though, and their need for relationships has really torn me apart.",1,"the person describes a persistent pattern of feeling excluded and unimportant in social and romantic relationships. they mention repeated rejections and a sense of never being anyone's first priority, which has led to feelings of emptiness and crying. their narrative reflects a deep-seated loneliness that has been a consistent part of their life, and they express a strong desire for meaningful connections."
"I wanted to turn my back on my old life, including friends real or fakeI am a little weird. I have a sordid past but I also have degrees from prestigious schools, a decent job, and I am married (again). I wanted to separate myself from my past which  was a lot of alcohol, drugs, crime, and I don't know how else to put it but just being obsessed with sex and finding new partners. I decided one day to turn my back on my past as much as possible, including these ""friends""  and to get off most social media. I am glad because a lot of those people were fake and just wanted me for something (drugs, sex, entertainment). I have more peace of mind now. 

But I don't have any friends around me anymore. I don't want to talk to some who are not bad because I am so ashamed of how I used to be. I want to meet new friends, at 36, who are my friends and not just friends of my wife's or whatever. But I do not know where to start. I don't know where to start. Should I just forget about it and focus on my job and self improvement (I am starting to try to get into shape)",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to their deliberate disconnection from their past social circles and the difficulty in forming new friendships. despite having a supportive partner and a decent job, they express a clear sense of isolation and a desire for genuine connections that are independent of their spouse's social network. their shame about their past further complicates their ability to reconnect with some of their former acquaintances, leading to a state of loneliness."
"Can anyone relate?I feel so lonely. People often rly like me when they first meet me, but once someone rly gets to know me and talks to me for a while, they get bored and annoyed and they leave. I feel so unloved in this world and alone. I can??t help but think that there is something wrong with me. I am also so awkward and shy around new people. I feel that they automatically hate me, probably because of my looks, but I think this is in my head. It makes me super shy and unfriendly, but I think I have a reason to feel this way because people always leave. Afterall, nobody wants to be around someone who is sad.",1,"the individual expresses feelings of loneliness and a belief that others leave once they get to know them. they mention feeling unloved, awkward, and shy, and believe these traits contribute to their isolation. this self-perception and the pattern of others leaving support the notion that they are experiencing loneliness."
"Channels of connection slowly breaking downFeeling low, one of my best friends once told me no matter what happened at home or between us there will always be channels for us to remain close through. Recently those have been disappearing rather quickly and I'm wondering if I'm just being outed...",1,"the narrative clearly indicates feelings of isolation and disconnection. the individual mentions channels of connection breaking down and feeling low, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the sense of being outed and the loss of close relationships further support this. hence, the classification aligns with the narrative."
"It's getting harder to want to even wake upI recently moved up to a new city and am finding it so hard to connect with anyone. I already felt like I had no one back home; heck, I even had to part ways with an ex because I was going to be moving and that still pains me. 

People will say to go get hobbies or try to go to meet up groups, but everything feels so forced. 

I've given up on trying to even make friends. I plan on just going to work and then coming home to sleep. Everytime I try to make any friend, it never lasts or it just feels so unreal.

I never wanted to live this long anyway. 
This lonliness is making it harder each day.",1,the person expresses feelings of isolation and difficulty connecting with others in a new city they also mention a lack of meaningful relationships both in their previous location and currently they describe the pain of parting ways with an ex and the failure of attempts to make new friends they have given up on trying to form connections and feel increasingly lonely

"No FriendsI have been in lockdown for about a year now and my school makes us use zoom. In zoom they don??t allow us to talk at all or chat to anyone so I have felt so lonely and in my state we can only go to places where we have to go to or we are arrested, so I haven??t seen my friends in over a year and I really have no friends, the one I have is a family friend. I have felt really lonely for a while and keep feeling more and more sad and I am on the brink of going into mania because I really can??t control my emotions anymore now because of me having no social interactions and not talking to a person my age or anyone besides my parents in a year, but I still try to be happy and I will keep trying to and I will keep trying to be happy and so should all who read this post, everyone who reads this, keep your head up because the world will be better some day and the pandemic will be over.",1,the narrative clearly describes feelings of loneliness due to prolonged isolation and lack of social interaction the individual mentions not having seen friends in over a year and feeling increasingly sad and emotionally unstable the context of the pandemic and restrictions further exacerbates their sense of loneliness despite their efforts to remain positive this aligns with the classification
":(I think I am currently at one of my lowest. So low that I just searched for lonely in reddit and this subreddit actually pops up. I doubt I??d go back to this but I think I am at my limit. I don??t even know if venting is allowed here. Really sorry.

If someone was to look at my situation from an external point of view, they would say well you??re surrounded by people you love. Lucky me. But I don??t really feel that way. I am sorry for feeling ungrateful but sometimes I feel like I literally have no one to talk to. All I do in my entire life is listen to people, to their stories, and eventually think that we become closer or our overall relationship is going well. They think I??m very open and approachable, but in the end it??s only them who actually said and shared something. I think I was just trained well to respond appropriately and at the right timing. Don??t get me wrong, I actually really listen sincerely as I can feel that they need that kind of someone. But no one really tried to you know, actually talk with me. I sometimes start to talk about me but in the end the topic switches, the person shows disinterest, etc. I feel like a vial wherein people just pour their everything. Their rants, their vents in life, their complaints, etc. I just want to empty it all out somewhere. 
In the end, I just wish someone would actually talk to me, like really talk with me in a two way conversation, where they??re both genuinely interested in whatever the other is saying. Is this really hard to ask for? Or am I just an unlucky person that even asking is too much?",1,the person feels isolated despite being surrounded by loved ones they express a deep sense of emotional loneliness as they feel they have no one to genuinely talk to their role as a listener leaves them feeling unappreciated and unheard they yearn for meaningful two-way conversations which they currently lack
"I want my fantasies to come true.My fantasies are just me being social. I struggled with being social since I could remember and I depend on others talking to me for a social life. I've tried talking to people but no words come out of my mouth and it feels like I'm being chained to one place. When I do manage to get some words out, i'll either stutter, be so quiet no one hears me or I do manage to talk properly but get ignored. I feel like such a loser sometimes. Like I was born inferior. Life is unfair. It really is. I'm not even important enough to be properly gendered. I've said multiple times my pronouns are they/it but everyone uses she/her like it's nothing.

I really want to talk about astrology with someone during recess. Astrology is a huge interest of mine. However, everytime my friends talk about astrology it's without me. I have tried joining in but I get ignored. It hurts so bad. It feels like my flame for astrology is showly dying. All because I don't have someone to talk about it with. It hurts when they talk about it without me. They have the rights too. But I wish they'd let me talk about it with them. 

If I could get two wishes, i'd wish to be properly gendered and to have someone to talk about astrology with during recess who won't leave me.",1,"the narrative clearly shows feelings of loneliness and social isolation. the person expresses difficulty in social interactions, feeling ignored and misunderstood. they mention a strong desire for social connection and being properly gendered, indicating a lack of validation and companionship in their life. these elements contribute to their sense of loneliness."

you guys call me a low-maintenance friend, which i totally agree with. i can be AWOL for months but when you need someone to talk to, i'm all ears. it's because i like having space and privacy. i enjoy solitude so much. but not always. i still want to be part of your life. not only when you feel sad or depressed, not only when you need help or advice, not only as your fill-in friend. 

when you sent that discord server invite in our groupchat, i immediately joined, assuming i'm welcome since i got the invite. it turned out to be a study server for our friends back in senior high. i was so thankful for that since i literally made no friends since college started one and a half month ago. i thought that it would help me so much so i wouldnt feel like im going through uni alone. 

during the first video call, you guys were so happy to talk to me again. but i'd like to believe i was much happier. that was a very rough week. i was so stressed, but it was a friday, and i waited all day since you, the one who made the server, said that you guys would study by 10 pm. I joined, and it honestly made my day, my week even. the only bad thing about it is it only lasted for like 2 hours. i understand that the purpose was to study, and not actually hang out. but the small talks and some jokes that were thrown during that call, i felt left out. i didn;t actually relate. obviously it's something i missed during my awol.

the next video call, i didnt have a heads-up. it was also a friday night, another hell week. around 10:30 pm i saw all of you in the call, no mics muted. i got excited because one of them wasn't present last time. i joined so fast, without letting you know through the chat first. i joined even if i had an essay to be passed before 12 am. i joined even if i had to cram the essay. but i didnt regret that. because those calls are the only way for me to reconnect with real people. with my friends. you guys were happy again. we talked and joked a lot. but mostly inside jokes. your inside jokes. i realized what was happenning. i tried to just listen and observe on your conversations --- while doing my essay. i then confirmed that all of you, in the server, are in a groupchat. a groupchat i never knew about. a groupchat i was never invited in. but i thought, that's not too bad right? i still got the invite for the server. maybe theyre just doing that since i was awol. and maybe they thought i dont want to join anyway. 

i asked you guys how long you will stay in the channel, you said maybe for another hour. i said you guys stay and i'll come back since i have to focus on the essay which i have to pass in like 15 minutes. after i came submitted it, i came back and all of you were gone. no chats or something. am i still part of our friendship?

last friday, as expected, all of you are on the call again. you guys knew i was online. you guys knew that if you were to message me, i'd answer right away. but i didnt know about it again. convinced myself that wait, maybe that was a coincidence, one randomly joined in the voice channel to just study by themself then another one saw and then joined and so on. but come on. those calls were scheduled. they planned it and talked about it. in that groupchat. that's why i was never notified. it was a really sad week for me.

that morning i messaged you, inviting you once again to play with me, along with our other friends. you said you'd love to when you get less busy. which i totally understand. we're all in college now, i understand that. but it's just... idk. during that conversation, i joked about how i felt like i don't have friends. how i wanna play a multiplayer game for example, and that i already have the game, now i just need friends. i always tell you about my day, how i still have no friends. i always tell you how i wanted to hang out with you guys again. and you know theyre genuine.

i'm sure you can tell when im excited or not. i'm always excited to talk to you. to talk in our now dead groupchat. i send a lots of blocks of messages. i spam texts and pics. i sent voicemails when telling a story, a very unfiltered one because you guys know how i never finish one story, since i always jump to another. that's how happy i am to talk to you guys. that's how much i want to feel connected. 

was i supposed to be in the discord server? or you just sent the invite in the groupchat since everyone in there is in the new groupchat except me, and hence would be easier?

i feel really left out. i like being alone but i don't wanna be lonely. i tell you how my junior high friends don't talk to me anymore. literally none of them. maybe they're busy, since again, we're in college now. or maybe because i dont reach out. you know i do. i message you guys, and the replies are just... dry. i dont feel the chemistry in our friendship anymore. you guys tell me you miss me, but i approached you, and every reply you make feel forced. like you just want the conversation to end. not to mention during those times you guys had a videocall.

now in college, it's just so hard to make friends. i honestly dont know why. is it because i lack in social skills? i tried to make some, but it seem like theyre only interested in finishing the group task and nothing else. 

in movies and soap operas, i used to laugh at how they exaggerate in portraying lonely characters. now i understand that it is indeed the real life. i dont wanna be like this. i've done some bad stuff and im not perfect, but i dont think im a bad friend. i just dont understand.

i stayed online in discord last friday, waiting because maybe you guys would notice me and maybe ping me. but i got nothing. i was so sad and wanted to talk to someone so bad, partly horny. so i went online to meet people. i met a guy, agreed to be in a **voice**call to do.. stuff. i agreed. i needed that. i was craving for any other interaction. it was just a bonus that he had a really good voice and had a great way with words. apart from the intimate stuff, what made me so attached to him is that he's so caring and... maybe i felt a connection? my heart was so happy the whole time we were in a call. we didnt just do it. we stayed on the call and talked about life, like new classmates meeting and getting to know each other. it was bare minimum. but i've been craving for that so bad. 

he even said he wouldnt just stick for a month, there will be other times. and of course, i know that's not true. that's the case with doing that shit. going online to meet horny people. they'll only be good for one time. the first and last time. it was good, it was fun, it was lovely, he made me feel human again. he made me feel.. important and seen? it's just sad and concerning that i got attached so easily. it's scary how i depend my happiness on other people. and it's depressing that we wont be talking again. and maybe i might not find someone who would make me feel things like how he does.

Never even was cared by someone even if I did try to associate with people for once. To those who are here because of covid-19, this is only a scratch of what loneliness is. Real loneliness is when even if everything went back to normal, people would still be forced to be away from you.

"i just want companyI left high school two years ago from now.   


I always felt lonely and isolated in general, so the feeling is not unfamiliar. I never felt like my connections were strong or that I was special to someone, BUT I had at the time (high school) a very strong group of friends I thought I would carry for the rest of my life. 

A few months later, after HS had ended, the pandemic started. I got to meet my friends a couple of times during last year but our distance was growing even before that year. Some of them started to date or were dating for years already and I watched myself slowly being deprioritized of their lives. That got me mad, and I'm still a little bit angry still even knowing that's just part of life sometimes.

Thing is, I got to a point last year where I was completely isolated, emotionally, mentaly, physically. My mental health which always was shakey and fragile took a down turn. (I believe I suffer from depression, but I never was officially diagnosed). At that time I had moved out from my mother's house ( which I'm back into btw) and I lived all alone for a couple of months. I had few text messages from time to time but I was getting lonelier and lonelier.

One year later from that time and here I'm. I literally have no one in my life right now appart from my mom, and she's honestly not the best company. I'm really tired of the isolation, one that started way before covid happened, an isolation which is rooted in childhood trauma. Trauma that changed my life and how I connect to people.

I also feel like I have no strength left in my body and mind to do anything for myself. I'm currently not working so I feel pretty useless and pointless right now, like my life has no meaning and goes nowhere. Outside pressures don't help a lot too. I can barely be self-sufficient and regulate my own emotions. 

I met a guy and he brought a lot of things that were boiling up in my mind already and that and many other realizations made me write this down. I feel worthless, desinteristing as I spent half of my life in my house, with no real friends, with people that didn't even care enough; alone. All of my family neglected me, people close to me died and of that led me to be very closed off, anxious and secretly starved for affection of any kind. He's the opposite of me.

"Being a parent is lonely....People always say that when you have kids you??ll never be alone again.

I guess that??s true in the sense that you??ve always got your kids, until they grow up that is.
The thing is though is that no one really talks about the fact that, while it??s amazing being a parent, it??s incredibly lonely. 

Friends you once had drift away when you have kids and they aren??t at that point in their lives yet. Going out is almost impossible, and even then the whole outing is usually spent worrying about the kids at home, did they brush their teeth? Are they behaving? Are they looking for mummy or daddy to tuck them in with a bedtime story? All these things make it feel like it??s easier to stay home.

Do other parents feel like this? Or is it just me?",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to the isolating nature of parenthood. they mention how friends drift away when they have kids and how going out becomes nearly impossible. they also express concerns and worries about their children, which further isolates them. this narrative clearly indicates feelings of loneliness and a sense of being disconnected from others."
"I need to stop trying to make friends online.All it does is feed false hope.  I know that I will *never* have any lasting friendships, simply because of my personality.  I get upset, and then I burn down every friendship I have.  It feels satisfying, much like destroying a treasured material possession when very upset.  I just unfriended everyone who I was recently in contact with on Discord, but it's been months since I've had any close friends.  Some may call my incapability of lasting connection a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I don't think it is.  I've put so much effort into trying to make friends, much to no avail, and when I do find someone who I ""click"" with (which seems extraordinarily rare, by the way), the friendship seems to be inevitably doomed to end within a year.  When I get upset, I can't control it.  I can't make the hurt go away or even lessen it, and it makes me want to hurt people.  Even if I know that I'll regret it later, I'll push people away.  I've threatened to do some pretty mean things if I wasn't left alone permanently.  To be honest, it often feels like I've never had even one real friend.  People may interact with me so they can feel good about themselves (because at least they aren't me!) and/or because they'd feel guilty if I were to overdose and die, as there's probably a linear relationship between the likelihood of me ODing and how incredibly lonely I feel.  It angers me very much when seems like someone is just pretending to be my friend.  Anyway, I'm going to order some more diluted fentanyl powder on the darknet, it's been a while since I've had any, and maybe I'll die this time.  Things aren't going to get better.  I'm also incapable of genuine achievement, so I have nothing whatsoever to look forward to, and never will.  Everything even remotely ""positive"" about me is fraudulent in some way.  I'll always be a ""bad person"" by societal standards, and pretending to be someone I'm not in order to gain social acceptance would only make me feel even worse.  I wish I could be liked and valued for who I am, but that's nigh impossible considering what kind of person I am.",1,the person is experiencing profound loneliness due to their inability to form and maintain lasting friendships they feel a deep sense of hopelessness and self-blame believing their personality is the root cause of their isolation their actions of pushing people away and the satisfaction they derive from ending relationships further exacerbate their loneliness their narrative reflects a cycle of despair and self-sabotage leading them to feel unworthy of genuine connection and friendship

Then Quarantine hit. I lost all friends but two. And I had my family, one parent at a time at least. That??s it. And that was tough. But I still lit up every time I met up with my two friends. I took them for granted so much

Now I??m at college. I finally did it. I finally have no one in my life. Sure, I can call a parent, or those two friends I talked about. What??s the difference, I??m just spinning in my room all day long. Slowly meeting people here, but it??s not the same so far.

It wasn't completely awful - you should do anything as long as you enjoy it, my problem is - I hear and see lots of stories about people having this one best friend they always hanged out with, for example the begging of ""Life is Strange 2"" or the song ""Death Bed"" and I start crying immediately.

I live alone and enjoy it at times, but most of my days are spent not having a single conversation with anyone in person. I've never been an outgoing person, and I don't know how to meet new people.

Just an absolutely lifeless soul trapped in a body that takes too long to die.  And this might very well be me raging and unstable and feeling everything is unfair and against me, but fuck me, even people who don't give a shit about others have someone loving them.

No matter what I do I somehow end up alone and lonelyI'm tired of being alone . Funny thing is I have no1 to blame but myself . I'm surounded by people who love me but all I seem to do is push them away. I don't try to but that always seems to be the end result . I know what I need to do to be a better person and yet I couldn't even be bothered. What's wrong with me ?,1,the narrative clearly expresses feelings of loneliness and self-blame. the person acknowledges being surrounded by people who love them but admits to pushing them away. they also mention feeling tired of being alone and questioning what is wrong with them. this consistent focus on loneliness and self-isolation supports the classification.
"Tired of toxic people, stuck and want to moveI'm currently healing from a toxic relationship and covid. I feel better with myself, and I have gain so much confidence these last months so I'm stronger than ever. But with covid and the break up I had to get back to my hometown close to my family. My mother is bipolar and she is stable now but she is extremely possessive and she still has some changing behaviours that I didn't miss.
She used to make suicidal attempt all the time when I was young. My brother will go to jail soon and they are talking about that all the time and I'm just fed up with this fucking dysfunctional family. I had no choice to get back here from some time because of the breakup with my ex boyfriend who was a real manipulative person. I'm following a therapy and my therapist has said so many things that I didn't realize before. She changed my life. Since I was used to be ""controlled"" all my life, I thought it was ""normal"" so I let people putting me down. I believed every horrible things they said to me. And now, I can say that I'm finally myself, I like myself and I'm proud of who I am, and I become assertive. I won't let anyone putting me down anymore. I have a lot of desires, I'm a passionate, curious person. But I'm here in this small hometown, I have my own appartement, at least, but I'm fed up with being here, close to my family. And I don't want to go back to the city where I used to live for 6 years. I'm a bit bored, and I have always wanted to move to an another city, or country, and live my life, for so long...But they were telling me how much I will not be able to do that, I'm a weak person....
But in reality, I'm not, and I have forgotten myself too much for them. My therapist is really supportive about that. My friends are too, even if they are maybe a bit sad. If there was no pandemic, I will be already gone! I love to meet new people, discover new cultures. I'm feeling so strong and confident now. But sometimes I cry after I see my family. But what can I do? I'm so exhausted to wait and it's really lonely there. I have no problem with being alone, but I want to see new places, new faces, and live my life without these leeches. I don't know what to do because of the pandemic. I know that I can meet good people, but yes it's really lonely for the moment and I feel stuck. :(",1,"the narrative indicates a person who is experiencing significant loneliness despite having some supportive relationships. the individual is healing from a toxic relationship and dealing with a dysfunctional family environment, which adds to their sense of isolation. the pandemic has further restricted their ability to meet new people and explore new places, contributing to their feelings of being stuck and lonely. despite their newfound confidence and support from friends and a therapist, the current situation leaves them feeling alone and yearning for change."
"Dont now if im depressedSo im 15 i know thats young and shit but i have ZERO social life, when i was young i had a group of friends and they moved away then i had another group but when we got unrolled for school all of my friends got to the same school and i didnt, so i was practically alone for the whole first year of being in a new school 
Then i met a group of friends and we quickly became good friends in that group there were a girl that i liked, we started dating and i broke up with her because she cared about me too much.. im a fucking idiot a year later i still think about her and make up fictional situations, not even sexual situations just like sitting and talking...",1,the person is lonely because they describe having lost multiple groups of friends due to circumstances beyond their control and express regret over ending a meaningful relationship they still think about a year later they also mention having zero social life which further indicates feelings of isolation
"Why is socializing so hardI??m an awkward person, not afraid to admit it. Starting a conversation with someone is not my strong suit. That being said I??m desperate for human interaction. To be completely honest I used to be quite an asshole to my peers in highschool. Won??t make any excuses as to why. I truly think I??m a changed person and have become someone who shows compassion towards others. But some of the things that I??ve done to others haunt me to this day. I can??t learn to forgive myself. Living in a relatively small community I??ve burnt too many bridges for me to be trusted by many people. I believe I don??t deserve affection in any shape or forum. So I??ve been an introvert for the last several years. It??s eating away at me. Having been diagnosed with clinical depression I??ve been known to be a downer around others, thus driving people away. I??m on a good combination of medications but they aren??t miracle drugs. So these days I just watch way too much porn, and eat way too much Ben &amp; Jerry??s. Asking for a friend.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to a combination of past behaviors, self-perception, and mental health issues. they acknowledge being awkward and struggling with social interactions. their history of negative behavior in high school has led to guilt and difficulty in self-forgiveness, resulting in a lack of trust from others in their small community. they express a belief that they don't deserve affection and have become an introvert, which is exacerbated by their clinical depression. their current coping mechanisms, such as watching too much porn and overeating, further highlight their sense of isolation and loneliness."
"I'm sick of itI've (18M) suffered from social anxiety my entire life, and last summer I started going to therapy for it. I'm better at making friends and I have a good number, probably the most since elementary where it's basically ""hey wanna be friends"" ""sure"" ""yay"" so that great but I'm just still feeling my same lonliness I've always had.
Never really had a girl to even call a friend really, so definitely never had a girlfriend.
It's sucks to cuz my older brother (by like 10 years who's kinda like a role model to me) has social anxiety as well but has had several girlfriends before my age and it just kinda throws salt in the wound, not that I'm mad but just kinda feel like a failure.
I've had crushes but never talked to them really and at this point I feel like I'm just making excuses like ""oh she sits to far away"" and whatnot.
I've thought of joining tinder but lots of people say it's mostly used for one night stands and I don't really care about sex or anything like that I just want a relationship.
Just kinda writing my thoughts on it. If you've come this far in reading thank you for taking the time. Any advice or comments? Anything is appreciated honestly.",1,"the person is lonely because despite making progress in therapy and having friends, they still feel the same loneliness they've always had. they mention never having had a girlfriend and feeling like a failure compared to their older brother, which exacerbates their sense of isolation. their desire for a meaningful relationship, rather than just casual encounters, further highlights their loneliness."
"A new subscriber to this subHello all

I can't seem to be able to talk to colleagues at work about how I feel. I feel very lonely, and I am not close either to my family.

Days are passing by. I can hardly do things because I'd very strong chronic pain, that have been there for years.

"Just beaten and weighted down by loneliness and emptinessJust something I need to get off the mind here.

I a 19yo male 20 in 2 days but who to celebrate with? 
No one.
Graduated high school at what cost? Lots but I done it anyway but I also feel empty in this accomplishment.
Days go on with irregularities nothing really changes like a prison cell or a new game start up in a campaign just the same things go on.
Couldn't keep close relationships even if I tried.
I got asked what's wrong with myself to be honest sadly I wouldn't know where to start.
Showers feel good but only for a short time like a good night's sleep but it gets monotonous.
I observe others quietly like a animal in a cage in the pet store curious on real human interaction but I'm stuck in a internal cage.
Purchased meaningless items to fill the void I don't consume I just try to find a filler for the black void of emptiness.
I was a young Chad but I broke like a 2x4 plank I thought I was made of iron but I was wrong.
Not a junkie seen enough to not consume or purchase anything of that nature.
I just want a way out or an escape but the wall is too high and the plane ticket is too expensive (figuritivly speaking).
Not everything is gold lined but bland or mundane here but I don't like making long posts or stories just something to say and you ever feel that whatever you do is ineffective or futile just could never find myself I got lost and never don't follow me I'm lost too it's a jungle.

"First day of schoolYall i started going to school again (I dropped out of high school months ago but now i decided to study and get into a uni) and i started late but the thing is one boy also started today and he immediately became friends with everyone while I couldn't even talk to anyone because of my anxiety like how do you make friends in literally ONE DAY?? Wtf?? Am i just not normal. What would you guys do in my situation? Like im in cafeteria right now sitting alone and drinking my tea and I am the only one who sits alone. I hate having no friends, I want to drop out again. Even the thought of sitting next to them and talking to them fucking scares me.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to their difficulty in making friends and social anxiety. they feel isolated, as evidenced by sitting alone in the cafeteria and struggling to connect with peers, which exacerbates their feelings of being different and not normal. their narrative reflects a desire for social connection but also a significant fear of social interaction."
"I feel like I will always be an outsiderI think the last time I had a real, close friend was in grade school. Throughout grade school I had a few friends and one best friend, but that was the last and only time I felt a sense of belonging. I feel like I have been overlooked my whole life. I have always been the second choice or the backup to people. I feel like no one ever enjoys my company/likes me as much as I like them. Basically my life has just been filled with lots of unreciprocated love. I have always been a very socially awkward person, and it is really, really hard for me to open up to me and be myself around people. In high school, I had one really close friend but she transferred to a different school after sophomore year and we lost touch. For the last two years of high school, then, I joined this group of friends who were already really close, so I never really felt included or connected to anyone in the group and I was always the outsider/loner, only hanging out with these people at lunch and during school assemblies so I didn't have to go alone. In high school I would literally make sure to pack my lunches strategically so that I would have enough food to distract me from having to talk. If I ate to fast and finished my lunch before the lunch period was over, I would just sit in silence awkwardly at the table surrounded by these people who were alll talking to each other but not me. So basically high school was awful. In college, I was able to make two really good friends my freshman year, but I transferred to a different college seater my freshman year because I had really, really bad anxiety and couldn't handle being away from my family. I have no friends at my new school, because everyone already kind of had their groups by the time I got there. When I say that I literally don't have a single friend at this school, I mean that. 

I don't know what is wrong with me, but there are times where I am hanging out with people and I want so badly to contribute to the conversation and know exactly what I want to say, but there is this mental block that prevents me from saying anything. Like no matter how much I want to talk and open up, I just can't. I think the only people I have ever been truly comfortable around and have been able to be myself around are my family members. I have 3 siblings and we are all pretty close in age, so we are pretty close and hang out together a lot. I am also really close with my parents, so it is nice that I do have some people who I can't be myself around. However, I know that everyone else in my family will move on and find their people and eventually we won't be each others' priorities anymore, and I am worried about what that means for me because I have no one besides them. Literally no one. I have never had a boyfriend or even been in a talking stage. I've never even really talked to a guy before. I am just so ridiculously shy and awkward that It seems like it is impossible for me to open up and be myself around others. It always just feels so forced; it never feels naturally, no matter whether I am trying to form a friendship of a relationship. It just makes me sad because I really like myself and who I am by myself. I feel like I am a really cool person with a lot to offer, but I can't seem to overcome this block and form relationships/connections with anyone. I worry that I will be alone forever. I can't handle the thought of going through life with no friends and no significant other. I hate being alone and I am so lonely, but I don't even know how to form connections.",1,"the narrative clearly describes a profound sense of isolation and difficulty in forming meaningful connections with others. the person recounts a history of unreciprocated relationships and a persistent feeling of being an outsider. despite having close familial relationships, there is a pervasive worry about future loneliness as family dynamics change. the individual's social anxiety and inability to open up further contribute to their loneliness. the narrative is filled with expressions of sadness and concern about a future without friends or a significant other, underscoring their deep sense of loneliness."
"I wish there was actually no one around me physically, now I feel lonely and trapped around people I know and loved for several years.It??s not that I don??t have any friends. Lately I??ve been getting to know my friends whom I??ve known for some time when we were in high school and I hate some of them. They are rude and disrespectful, make fun of me to the point I lose my self confidence and my will to spend time with people. When I tell them how bad they make me feel they say ??women can??t take jokes,?? that I should be thankful because they see me as a close friend and it??s just friendly banter. The ??friendly banter?? consists of jokes telling how stupid I am, how I won??t get to go to the university of my dreams because ??I don??t have the potential and intelligence,?? jokes that make fun of women, jokes that make fun of the lgbt community, minorities and people with the same world view as me. (I??m an atheist in an otherwise Muslim country and half of them are conservative Muslims) All but one of them have started University except me, I??m trying for another year because I couldn??t make the score I had to make to go to one of the best medicine schools in our country, but I didn??t fail at all, It was just lower than what I expected from myself . I did better than some of them, even. 

Some of the jokes are indeed a little more on the friendlier side but it makes me feel really bad when someone ridicules me for every little thing I do and say. I was always a sensitive person but I could take jokes. I know I am not overreacting but still, they make me question myself as if I??m the one that??s overly sensitive and hard to be friends with. 

All of my best friends have moved. One of them went to a different country and two of them are living in another city. The three of us are in the same group, which sucks terribly because they came to our hometown rarely and for a short period of time. When they do, we all hang out together, both the people I want to see and the ones that bully me. I miss my friends a lot, the feeling is terrible. I want to do nothing but cry myself to sleep because of how lonely and misunderstood I feel. There are days I don??t talk to anyone besides the necessary ??please?? and ??thank you??s, including my mom and dad. One thing I was not prepared for is touch deprivation. Getting my eyebrows plugged at the salon feels incredible, even though the actual plugging part hurts like a bitch.

This is a wall of text that doesn??t wrap up, I know and I??m sorry. I needed to share how I feel but hate to bother people. Making a reddit post is like screaming to the void. If people want to/have the energy to read it they do and no one??s bored.",1,"the person feels lonely because they are surrounded by people who make them feel misunderstood and disrespected. they miss their best friends who have moved away and feel isolated despite being around others. their current social interactions are negative, leading to feelings of loneliness and touch deprivation. they express a strong desire to cry and feel a lack of meaningful connections."

I wish I felt nothing for anyone.But I do. I love people so much who just do not care about me and holy shit is that a fucking nightmare to live in. Day in day out all j think about is not being so fucking isolated internally. Like meeting someone who looks at me like I'm not worthless or ugly. But I just don't think that's gonna happen. And I think I've figured out that I can't handle that anymore.,1,the person feels deeply isolated and expresses a strong sense of being unloved and unappreciated. they mention a desire to connect with others but feel it's unattainable. this persistent feeling of internal isolation and lack of meaningful connections is a clear indication of loneliness.

I don??t think I can find a relationship againI??m genuinely so lonely rn because of quarantine and I??m the type of guy that wants to be in relationship mainly because if I don??t have someone to love I get kinda sad but now I??ve been without a girlfriend for a month or two and now with quarantine I feel like I can??t find anyone anymore especially my type aswell and even after quarantine is over I feel as if I won??t be able to find someone because of all the restrictions in place with distancing just kinda want someone to talk to now :(,1,the narrative expresses feelings of loneliness due to the lack of a relationship and the impact of quarantine restrictions. the person mentions feeling sad without someone to love and expresses concern about finding a partner in the future. this indicates they are experiencing loneliness.
alone againafter 3 months of being together my gf broke up with me last night. I don??t even remember who I was before I met her. this was my first serious relationship and it crumbled away so quickly. she grew  very distant and isolated from me in the last few weeks and I probably emotionally drained her. my ears have been ringing ever since last night and when I??m not around anyone I just break down into tears. I know she??s still in love with me but she ended things bc of depression and her job and schoolwork. I put in so much fucking effort I put my entire heart into this relationship and it??s all fucking gone and I don??t know what to do with myself.I feel selfish and gross and I just want her back but I know it won??t ever be what it was. this was the first time I had been happy in over a year and it??s gone,1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness due to the recent breakup with their girlfriend. they feel lost without the relationship, indicating a deep emotional dependency. the narrative expresses intense feelings of isolation, sadness, and a lack of direction, which are all signs of loneliness."
"The struggle for wanting to feel loved during nights of loneliness. Ive always struggled with relationships and i wanted to reach out to those who have a similar issue.

My last relationship was with someone who was not emotionally involved and did the bear minimum at the start then let it fade. I don??t think my appearance had anything to do with it?? at least i hoped not. Maybe it was my mental health struggles that he never cared to learn about?? or just simply got bored of me. Maybe I wasn??t as feminine.. i do struggle with gender a lot. Never felt woman enough or man enough..but thats a topic for another day.

I work a simple job at a bakery,which I appreciate but it does get out of hand dealing with hungry people. I dont have close friends because i push them away.. mostly due to the fact that i overthink and ruin things. I guess i got used to the loneliness and watching from the sidelines.. watching  strangers slowly fall in love while im out walking my dog. At least love exists but maybe im meant for loneliness. Thats a constant thought and maybe one day it??ll convince me that its true.

All i wanted was someone for myself . My own person that indulges in sweets and enjoys animals. Someone to keep me warm during the cold winters when im all shakey. Someone to play in the snow as if were children. Someone to have some firsts with?? ive never had a picnic before or went on a actual date. Someone to talk to for hours on end and be happy. Someone to hold me and tell me i mean something to them. I want to feel pure love for the first time in my life even if it risks experiencing heart break. Maybe then ill feel more alive.",1,"the narrative indicates a profound sense of loneliness through various aspects of the person's life. they mention struggling with relationships and feeling a lack of emotional connection from past partners. they also express feelings of inadequacy related to their gender identity and mental health, which may contribute to their isolation. the person acknowledges pushing friends away due to overthinking, further compounding their loneliness. they describe a longing for love and companionship, highlighting their desire for meaningful connections and experiences they have yet to have. this consistent theme of isolation and yearning for connection strongly suggests that the person is experiencing loneliness."
"The Void ReturnsThe loneliness I feel comes and goes, and I hate that it's here. It feels like a hole in my heart that sucks in everything positive, leaving me only with this feeling of loss despite never having had anyone to begin with.

"33 m married, have a kid, have a good job, but not many close friends... sure gets lonely having no one to relate toHey,

First, I want to admit I have flaws??I can be crass, offensive, too political (left), braggy, judgmental. I made way too many anti-Trump posts that I think just annoyed my friends and pissed some of my family off without really accomplishing anything. Second I love  my wife, love my daughter and have a good job, just stress about job stability in this economy so overall my life is good??I don??t lack for anything and my family is great. However, I??m not really a super social guy and never had tons of friends (seeming less by the year). I??ll be in a conversation with people and say ??how are you and your wife or family?? and people will kinda talk past me. Even when my daughter was born I noticed a huge difference in the response from my friends vs my wife??s friends who seems more genuinely interested and excited. Maybe that??s a sexist thing? 

Anyways, after having a kid I??ve had a lot of weird mental energy, some anxiety, some just thoughts and reflections I??d like to share them with. I have a brother who I am somewhat close with but not someone I talk to a lot. Used to go to therapy for work related stress a few years back but didn??t really accomplish much and felt like it was mostly a rip off, although I did like my therapist.

Being realistic, do I just focus on my career and family or do I put more effort into making friends? Kinda feels hard with COVID-19... not really depressed per se, but definitely just wish I had closer or more friends to bounce ideas off of and talk about stocks and baseball. I have a few coworkers that I talk to about stuff but we??re not really friends outside the office/Slack... 

What to do? Is this normal for 33? I feel like people see me as kind of an asshole who is overly political so they avoid me. So I regret that... but it??s hard for me to shut up sometimes even if I know arguing over it changes no one??s mind. I guess I??m increasingly over discussing politics openly except on forums like reddit, otherwise there is too high a social cost. Most people simply don??t care.

Beyond that, when I moved to college I didn??t keep in contact with my high school friends except maybe a few, same in college didn??t ever build a lasting network. 

So am I just an oddball loser? Sometimes the people who want to be friends with me are other lonely sort of losers, but then they just want to vent and talk about their problems. I just want to bounce ideas about stocks, work politics, baseball, etc

"Why does everything come so easily to other people?I'm 19 and everyone around me is surrounded by their best friends having the time of their life. I have friends but no one close and no one to hang with regularly. The only time I really see anyone is when I message them and even when I'm with friends I still feel lonely because they're all very close and I'm just kind of there. A group of friends I have know I feel close to them and know about how badly I'm doing but still don't want to ever message me to do things, only when they need something from me or when I message them first do I get to speak to anyone. Out of everyone I know I'm the only person who doesn't have a close friend group I'm just on my own all the time. It was even worse at the start of the year when I had literally 0 friends and I thought things were getting better before I realised my ""friend group"" actually just turned into a bunch of smaller groups and I was left with no one. It's always been like this and I don't think it'll ever change.",1,the person feels isolated and disconnected from others despite having acquaintances they lack close friendships and meaningful connections which leads to feelings of loneliness they also express a sense of being excluded and only contacted when others need something from them this ongoing pattern contributes to their belief that their situation will not improve

"Trouble making friends in your 20sOne of my biggest insecurities is having trouble making and keeping friendships and its starting to get me down. I am a big introvert and suffer anxiety with bouts of depression which started when I moved away to university. I tried to stay in touch with my group of friends from school but many seemed disinterested in talking to me unless I could visit home and go to clubs. This was always something I was never a huge fan of but did to see friends but during uni I suffered financially and couldn't afford this. It especially hurt deeply that my best friend (or who i thought was my best friend) stopped contacting me because of this, even meeting up when i was visiting home.

This made it harder to make friends at uni too but i made a couple friends which was nice and had a long term relationship too which made me feel less lonely. Since moving back home and starting a masters degree, only one friend from uni kept in touch with me and we see eachother once or twice a year. I had tried to get back in touch with an old friend from school and we saw eachother a couple times but she would stand me up frequently to the point where I gave up on the friendship.

I have since found it increasingly hitting my self esteem and making it so much harder to make friends. I made two new friends last year online that I ended up meeting in person as theyre from where I live but I only meet up with them every so often due to work or study commitments, but recently they seem to have been less bothered about talking to me or meeting up, and then I see them on social media hanging out with big groups of people they call their friends and although I am happy they have that, it makes me feel left out and I often wish I was closer to them or had someone other than my SO to call a best friend.

I really value female friendship and not having that connection other than a text here and there makes me feel distant and lonely. I worry that it is me, have I said something? am I not fun enough because im introverted? Previous friendships at school i was often walked all over because I was the quiet one or shy and then I started standing up for myself and distancing from those that did this or made me feel uncomfortable for being introverted. But it seems I cant strike a balance. When I am out with others, i feel I cant fully be myself because of this.

On top of this, I am starting a teaching degree in a few weeks to become a science teacher and while I have come out my shell a lot since being a shy school kid, I always worry I am overlooked or belittled because I am naturally quieter and softly spoken.

I now feel embarrassed, am on benefits, am unable to work and suffering PTSD. I already have BPD, and did a lot of work to stabilise myself. I built up a job, had friends, relationships etc but the last one floored me and I??m now either always too scared or too detached to ??get out there?? again. 

I also had to move to a new area which is quite isolated.

I leave in two weeks and I have no send off, no going away, hell my family aren't even making an effort to see me before I go. 

It's funny cause the announcement I made on facebook about the move got over 200 likes but not a single person has reached out to chat, video, grab lunch, etc. All of this is incredibly depressing and not how I imagined my last few weeks in the states would be.

No clue. 

I??m not doing well right now. I am alone and I am lonely. I haven??t been in a romantic relationship for three years now, much less a sexual one. So that??s lacking. Yet, what they say is absolutely true: you won??t die if you don??t have sex. 

I??m in my late forties. I??m not ugly at all, though I have let myself go over time and I??m embarrassed about myself physically right now. Gonna get on that. I could do with losing about 7-10 pounds. I??m 6??1. Not that any of this really matters. Does it? 

No.

I cannot seem to bond with anyone, or make connections with prior peers. My grades have been falling, and I've been at an all time low. I'm not sure where to go from here.

But whenever he gave me some knowledge or advice about life it was amazing and made my life much easier. I still do and follow what he told me. But having him gone I don??t really think there will be a way to make up completely who I am. I just think about Ian Curtis from Joy Division. And Elliot Smith.

What??s happened to me at one point I had friends were they ever good friends no but I had them. Last year no one even wished me a happy birthday now I go off to school and no one even seems to care. It really does feel as though I only live for myself and that no one cares about me.

As for silver linings, I guess at least my lack of received affection in my life has ensured I haven't become dependent on such things. I suppose loneliness builds character. And I'm glad that I still feel, even if it means I almost always feel lonely, and depressed, and at times massively unhappy with my life. Still, I lay here at 1 in the morning on a Monday and wonder what that must be like, being held, and cared for, and knowing that things will be okay. Maybe I'll know someday. But not here, not now.

To feel like no one is there for me. In my friends, I tend to be the shoulder. The shoulder to lean on.

Between depression, anxiety , chronic pain and a very toxic relationship, I find myself going days without talking to people. I'm a classic people pleaser with no boundaries and due to trauma, I have lot and lots of people in my life , whose problems I listen to and help them. All of them think I'm very close to them. 

But I have no one. Yes I can shit text one or two of them, but no one to ever check on me. And it's okay, I find myself telling myself. I listen to and help people with no ulterior motive but I find it hard to go on somedays.

I go from app to app, refreshing as if I'll miss a message. When messages do come, saying I'm not fine is not even an option. And plus they wouldn't understand me. Shallow , self absorbed people, is what I like to call some of them. Maybe I'm too harsh. Or maybe I'm too kind. I can't say.

Work has lost meaning few months ago, and sometimes I feel like crying on work calls. I can't frame sentences because somedays I don't know how. I know I'm an empath , but some days I hate everyone, and have no empathy for anyone.

I look at the walls of our shared bedroom , thinking I don't even have my own space. I cry in my bathroom and sit in various places on my bed, as if the feelings and mood will change.  I crave touch , and love. Even an internet stranger who simply cares about me and nothing else.

How did I get so lonely. What did I do wrong. How will I go back to work soon, not being able to cry during the day - striking meaninglessness conversations with people, pretending I care. I remind myself that this is not rock bottom. Rock bottom would be in September when I go back , surrounded by people and yet no one who could see my broken heart and soul. 

Why don't others have that same ability I have to see through 'im fine'. Why doesn't anyone ever truly care with no ulterior motive, if I'm fine. Why doesn't anyone just hear without giving me their toxic positivity.

Will my brain lose the ability to form words? My parents whine about them being lonely. They have each other. They talk. He and I don't even talk. Too empty souls , too scared to leave each other. But can it get worse. I'm so scared of that day. Days pass thinking , how would it be if today was my last day on earth. And I know I would never actively want to die, but where are all those accidents and scary infections. Why doesn't one of them knock me out and end this endless , soul empty-ing loneliness of mine to rest....

Part of me really just wants to make a real connection with someone but will I even be able to do so in this state of mind? It just brings me back to, What??s the point?

"Is anyone else completely lonely?Like who doesn't even have anyone to talk to? With zero friends and no partner and they mean it? Since I cut contact with a fake friend that person being the only one I could talk to I'm living a nightmare. It's a never ending cycle for me: I meet someone, we become friends then they slowly show their true colors, they hurt me and we end the friendship. Then I'll go on by being completely lonely for a long time. That's how my life has been since many years. But this time I really can't take it anymore. People would say ""oh, you'll find someone that will stuck with you don't worry"" but I've been waiting for ""that someone"" since my teenage years. It's painful when even in these kind of subreddits you see people who actually have friends. Like, how do people manage to have not one friend, but many? I tried to make friends, at least online. For example, I'm asexual and I joined an asexual forum. It didn't work. I played online games to meet new people and make new friends, it didn't work as well. Hell, on my favorite game I really wanted to befriend a person that I found interesting but the feelings weren't reciprocated. Which hurts even more. I tried here on Reddit, for many years actually, never made any friend from those friendship subs. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been described as smart and kind but I'm still avoided like plague or people are just not interested. I feel like the most inferior person. I feel like I'm not part of these species. I'm crying every night because I just want someone to talk to, I just want a friend. Why can't I have at least that? All I have is non stop suffering. The only thing that kinda helps me is alcohol. But it's going to become useless in the future. I think I just have to accept the fact that I'll be completely alone for the rest of my life and that I will die alone. I'll probably become insane,that's it.",1,the person is experiencing profound loneliness as evidenced by their repeated failed attempts to form and maintain friendships they express a deep sense of isolation and despair about their inability to connect with others and feel different from everyone else they are struggling emotionally and resorting to alcohol for temporary relief which indicates a serious level of distress and loneliness
"I love being alone, I just hate being lonely.Introverted 15M with severe anxiety and depression, both relating to ASD.

I don't get along with people face-to-face. My own family grates on my nerves. It's gotten to the point where I practically live in my room, only venturing out to grab food or use the bathroom.

And, for the most part, I like this lifestyle. Not having someone constantly watching over me feels great. However, as I have learned, there are two main drawbacks to this.

Firstly, my personal hygiene is horrid. I shower once or twice a week (at best), wear the same clothes for days on end, and have yet to open a fresh tube of toothpaste that's been sitting on the counter for months. My messy environment doesn't help, either. I've found dirty sushi trays trapped under my bed on more than one occasion.

Secondly, I don't have any friends.

Well, that's not entirely true. I have one friend who lives down the street from me, yet we haven't seen each other face-to-face in literal months, and my anxiety keeps me away from texting him. So, yeah. One friend, whom I haven't seen since June. It probably doesn't help that I'm homeschooled, either.

I know some of you are thinking, ""Well, why don't you go out and make them?"" And I want to. The thing is, I just can't. I cannot set foot in a public area without having a massive panic attack, provided it's located anywhere near my former school. I'm fine with going out in totally alien areas, so long as no one tries to talk to me, in which case the anxiety gets almost unbearable.

I do have meds to treat it. My psychiatrist prescribed me extremely low doses of hydroxyzine. They are supposed to be taken situationally, and I would, if my mom would let me have access to them. I think she's afraid I'll get addicted or overdose, which is practically impossible at this dosage. We've brought it up to the psychiatrist, and he sides with me, but she still won't listen.

My only interactions with non-family members are with biweekly group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, those go swimmingly. It seems I can't hold a conversation with anyone who isn't mentally ill to some degree...

I don't particularly want to be in a relationship. I've never really felt the urge to be in one. Back when I was in public school, some people would hint about their feelings toward me, and I just wouldn't care. That said, having a girlfriend would probably help to some degree, at least until the inevitable breakup. I'm woefully irresponsible, so I'd probably end up dragging the person down.

I think I'm just gonna cut it off here. This post was supposed to be a ""help me"" affair, but at this point it's become the ramblings of a total lunatic (he he).

TL;DR: At this point, my social life is a lost cause.",1,"the narrative clearly indicates the individual experiences significant loneliness. despite expressing a preference for being alone, the person acknowledges a lack of meaningful social connections, with only one friend they haven't seen in months and difficulties engaging with others due to severe anxiety and depression. their isolation is exacerbated by their living conditions and limited interactions, primarily through group therapy. the underlying desire for social connection, hindered by mental health challenges and a restrictive home environment, contributes to their profound sense of loneliness."

My country has been reopening up after a deadly second wave in summer. Although my situation hasn't improved but I'm doing pretty much good for now. I'm still lonely but it doesn't bother me much since I keep myself busy with studies and hobbies. I just wish please there's no another lockdown. It's been fuckin two years living at home now. I don't have a social life. The only time I leave home is for morning walk and gym which is nearby. I don't meet anyone in my gym as it's empty for my time slot. I'm fine with it mostly as I'm used to no social life. I have some good friends from college with whom I text and call occasionally. I wanted a pet very badly for emotional support / distraction. FYI I love animals so I know I will take good care. I occasionally feed the stray doggos. I wanted to do therapy for depressive episodes but I don't want to burden my family with extra expenses. I have overcome my emotional issues since past months and if there's another lockdown, I don't think I'll be able to cope up anymore",1,"the person is lonely because they explicitly mention their lack of a social life and their limited interactions with others. they describe only leaving home for a morning walk and gym, which is usually empty. they also mention feeling the need for emotional support and distraction, such as wanting a pet and considering therapy for depressive episodes. their concern about not being able to cope with another lockdown further highlights their sense of isolation."
"Why is life miserable?During this lockdown I am getting progressively bored and lonely. As someone who does not have and SO, or anyone to talk to for that matter is very depressing. I have decided to cut contacts with my friends as I am going to uni this year which  quite far away.  They also  do too many drugs and that environment is not a healthy one . It is very hard to talk to them normally, since I don??t do drugs anymore so they have found other people with similar interests.

I also try my hardest to make everyone happy but I just get fucked over with no real benefits also since my parents also separated this leaves me feeling carry all of this like a boulder on my shoulders since I have to look out for all my sibling as the eldest and deal with this shitfest

I never thought I could feel so lonely. This person basically gave no fucks about me, so I had no one to talk to. If i spoke up about how I felt, I either got yelled at, called stupid or a whore, or abused. I'm currently sitting here with a busted lip writing this. I don't want to be this lonely ever again.

It seems that tonight you are the only ones who I can share my feelings with. 

I'm 27 old man with good career and partner that I love, tomorrow we will marry. I didn't wanted any ceremony or party at all because from my perspective it's just a ridiculous waste of money, time and nerves. So we've came to compromise - small ceremony with family only.

The problem is I don't have a family. My mom died from cancer when I was 7 and my dad never lived with me. My uncle, who I lived with after mother died has died, and my grandma who I lived with after my uncle died has died, and the last person who I lived with until I finished school and went to university is my sister in law who actually a criminal and horrible person.

"My experience with Loneliness, and severe Social Anxiety.This is going to be kinda long, so sorry in advance if it looks like a wall of text. This will probably get buried, but I greatly appreciate anyone that sees, and reads this. 

So, here it goes:

I'm about to be 17 years old, and fortunate to have 1 friend, and a GF (long distance), but generally I don't talk to anyone. For the last 3 years of my life I've been endlessly falling into an abyss. Seemingly, my misery won't end until the day I die.

It hurts seeing the connections others have, and the endless amount of stories they have with the people the hold dearest. I want a story of my own to tell, but I'm too timid, and shy in nature to do much of anything.

The truth is, I've had really bad social anxiety my entire life. I'm not on the spectrum or anything. I'm just too reserved. One might think it's because I want it to be that way, but in all honesty, that isn't the case. I desperately want to make connections. I want to have friends, and I want to be able to socialize with others. I really do love talking to people, and it's the only thing that brings me happiness anymore.

Talking has always been an issue for me. My social anxiety makes me so quiet to the point where people might actually assume that I'm mute. Whenever people do try to talk to me, I usually seem uninterested, or unfriendly - usually because of how nervous I get. I feel so pathetic that I'm afraid that my girlfriend will leave me because of how shy, and quiet I am. I feel like my heart crackles whenever I consider the possibility.

I spend every day staying in my room doing nothing, but dreading life. I've contemplated ending my life to escape my pain. I feel like I'm at the end of the road, where this is as good as life is ever going to be. That I'm just going to be sad, and lonely forever.

So, that's my take on life. Not much else to say.

TL;DR: Living life in a lonely bubble, unable to escape. Severe social anxiety has crushed everything left in me.",1,"the person describes intense feelings of loneliness and isolation. they express a deep desire for social connections but feel hindered by severe social anxiety. their narrative includes a sense of hopelessness and despair about their current situation and future, indicating profound loneliness."
"Spent the 5th alone.The 5th of November is guy fawkes night in the UK, and is one of three days in the year that I really like to get out, hang out and be social and jovial with people. My one and only 'friend' - and I use that term loosely is one of these people that only keeps people around him if/when they're useful. The last two years or so has taken to drinking almost every night. A week ago we had plans to go karting, then go and catch an organised fireworks display in a city about an hours drive away from here. I say 'plan' as much as it is possible to have plans with him, because again... Everything revolves around him and his schedule. Suffice to say, he went out last night and got wasted, totally eliminating the possibility of us doing anything today. So I slept. Pretty much the whole day, alone. I did manage to get out and go to the movies by myself...but still, by myself. I could have gone to an organised fireworks display or something by myself, but what's the point if you can't laugh joke and mess about with the people you're with? You'd just be a Billy no mates who stands around, doesn't interact and just goes home. Pointless. This one 'friend' is literally the only one I do outdoorsy things with and he can't even lay off the fucking alcohol for one night so he can stick to a plan he made a week ago. I can't make plans. The plans have to be his, and even then they're just flexible plans. 'at somepoint' 'probably' 'if we have time' 'if I don't have other plans'.

I have other friends sure, but honestly they have other issues that I don't have any patience for because they're problems of their own choosing, or character flaws that they either won't acknowledge, or won't correct. I have flaws, that much I'll admit but I won't make my problems other people's problems. I'll just keep them to myself and just live in the moment if I'm with friends, and i don't get why other people just can't swallow their bullshit for a while, and not tell me about it.

It honestly occurs to me that I am the problem, I play this hard done by person but maybe I attract this kind of thing because of the type of person I am? I honestly don't know what to do, other than do what I've been doing for way too long and just shut myself in, ignore other people's requests to hang out (especially this one 'friend' brcause it's always his idea to go out, and never mine) and just try and figure out my own thing to do. Which in all likelyhood is just going to be the same as always, more YouTube videos, TV and movies than the average person, sleep, rinse, repeat.

I think I'm done with people. Or maybe they are done with me. Either way, it's lonely as fuck, and i fucking hate it.",1,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of loneliness and isolation. the person describes spending significant time alone, particularly on a day they usually enjoy socializing. they feel let down by their only 'friend' and struggle with making meaningful connections. they also mention shutting themselves in and ignoring social requests, which reinforces their sense of being alone. their frustration and introspection about being 'done with people' further highlight their loneliness."
"At this point, i already know I'm always going to be alone.I've never had friends really, I've never been close to anyone, I've never hugged anyone (at least from any of my memories), and I've never dated...which i probably never will.

I thought maybe things would get better after i got older, got a job...but nothing has changed, it's just gotten worse...

I just feel terrible all the time, trying to ignore how much I hate being alive, and how lonely i am, and how i know that nobody will ever love or even like me in any sort of way...",1,"the narrative describes a person who feels deeply isolated and disconnected from others they mention never having friends, never being close to anyone, and never experiencing affection or romantic relationships they express a sense of hopelessness about their future social prospects and a pervasive feeling of loneliness this aligns with the label indicating loneliness"
"I??m starting to have a feeling where all of my friends don??t like me anymoreSchool is starting in 2 more days for me, so 3 weeks earlier I asked all of my friends if they wanna hang out with me before school starts, unfortunately they all said no, some just ignored me and some say they were not interested. I recently saw their post/stories about them having fun, weather they were at the mall, or zoo or even just messing around at a 711. While I was just sitting on a couch doing nothing at all. So technically, I wasted a whole summer doing nothing, I could??ve done plans with myself but being alone isn??t that fun. Since school is starting in 2 more days for me, I am not excited to go through the same bullshit again, at school no one likes me, with no one liking me it cause me to be extremely lonely at school, a lot of times it made me sad to the point my grades start dropping. My dad keeps yelling at me to get good grades, but my loneliness isn??t allowing me to do so. I have been dealing with this problem since grade 1, the school thought I have some learning disability because of it.",1,the person is experiencing feelings of loneliness due to the rejection from their friends and the lack of social interaction over the summer. they feel isolated and are dreading the return to school where they anticipate continued social exclusion. this ongoing loneliness is also affecting their emotional well-being and academic performance.
"Hopefully this fits this subI don??t know that I fit the dictionary definition lonely, I have a group of friends that care about me, but throughout my first two and a half years of high school I would find myself at home alone after school while other people would be making plans and hanging out. The root of this problem feels like it stemmed from the fact that my closest friend is somewhat introverted and spends a lot of time with his family. This combined with him having a packed schedule and a girlfriend largely limited the of social interaction I experienced. This year I??ve been making an effort to hang out with other people to stop feeling alone, but now with lockdown and whatnot, all bets are off. I??ve been feeling very lonely, but even though my friends have been online on discord I??ve been feeling very low on energy and feel like I don??t have the energy to interact with others.

Sometimes it feels like a hole in my chest, sometimes it feels like someone is wielding a sharp knife, uncontrollably stabbing my heart.

Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic about the future... but when things are fresh, they fucking suck. Some things still stick with me to this day. I spend the moments that I have alone refreshing new on subreddits and reading posts, listening to music, and playing games. This combination of things helps keep my brain busy the most. I keep the hope alive in my heart that one day things will change and I'll meet more people who don't make me feel alone and make me look forward to each day. Someone nice to spend the nights with. I know there are people out there that feel the exact same way as me, somewhere. We need each other right now but we just haven't met. Maybe we never will. Life is cruel like that... but it's okay. I'm doing my best, and maybe things will start to look up for me. It's all I can hope for, because without holding onto that hope and optimism, my life will only be sad. I want more, I want to be happy. Hopefully I don't have to wait much longer, because damn I'm having a hard time. 23 is my lucky number, and since I'm 23 now, I've been telling myself maybe this year good things will happen.

My friend just told me shes pregnant with baby number 3. I instantly became overly jealous/envious bc i have fertility problems and no relationship atm and i want a kid. I recognize that this is wrong and i just want to be happy for her but im mad. So thats toxic and i feel like its my responsibility to distance myself from her because thats the last thing she needs rn.

But then i realized shes literally the only friend i have. Well, i have one in Alaska but yeah. Now i just feel lonely. I dont know how to go make new friends.

I have developed such hatred seeing people with friends/partner at the grocery store. And I'm also very paranoid thinking people at the store are out to get me or laughing at me.

"Left abusive marriage, feel so lonely and abandoned by so called friends2 months ago, I left my abusive spouse and never looked back. I was abused physically, sexually, verbally and financially. When I left, I was hoping my friends would support me and help me throughout the transition. Ever since I left, no friend has been there for me at all. I feel so abandoned and lonely. I would help my friends in a heart beat but this experience really opened up my eyes and I feel so much pain daily. 

All I needed from them was a text or a call to prevent me from falling into a deeper depression. Is that too much to ask? 

While I'm dealing with the aftermath (divorce process, no job, no car, no home, healing etc.), I feel so lonely and empty. Some days it feels easier to just lay down in bed and fade away.

"Been feeling better lately so I haven??t posted here in a while but now I??m back.I??m back because, well, I??m lonely. For a while I blamed myself but come to think of it I have nothing to blame myself for. I consider myself a genuine person that is kind to others, and probably cares too much for others as well. When people want nothing to do with me it??s easy to blame myself, which is what I have done, but realistically it??s other people that are to blame. I have no friends because I choose to not have friends. Not because I??m incapable of friendship, but because the people I usually allow to get close to me aren??t bettering my life in anyway. They are actually making my life worse. I tend to hold onto friendships, or relationships for that matter, longer than I should. Only for it to end by their choosing when I should??ve been me to end it. I knew all along it wasn??t worth my time, yet I gave it my everything. And when they finally decide to cut me off, it feels like a diss to me. Like I??m the one that caused it. Everyday I try to progressively become better at not caring about other people as much, but there is still that void that needs to be filled. Will I ever find the right one to fill that gap? Who??s to say. I will keep trying though. I do know that next time I won??t be wearing the shoes in the relationship. A precautionary for myself, so I won??t let myself be hurt by someone again.",1,"the person is lonely because they explicitly state that they are lonely and discuss the challenges they face in forming and maintaining meaningful relationships. they mention feeling a void and questioning whether they will ever find someone to fill that gap. they also describe a pattern of holding onto relationships longer than they should and feeling hurt when those relationships end, indicating a sense of isolation and emotional pain."

A year ago yesterday I gave birth to twin sons, they both died only hours after being born. Not one of my friends or family members (other than my husband and mom) reached out. And then this morning my mom showed me all the messages her friends sent her yesterday. Meanwhile I??m forgotten completely. It would be nice to have those kind words sent my way sometimes. 

I??m grateful for what I do have. But my heart hurts. It??s so lonely being a grieving mother. People don??t want to reach out or talk to me about it (or anything for that matter). It makes them uncomfortable. So I??m left alone. And maybe I should reach out to someone but I don??t want to be that burden. I don??t want to bring people down. So instead I post on Reddit I guess. At least it feels good to vent to random internet strangers.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness despite the presence of close family members. the individual feels isolated in their grief, particularly due to the loss of their twin sons and the lack of support from friends and extended family. this emotional isolation, coupled with the perception of being a burden if they reach out, deepens their sense of loneliness. posting on reddit is a way to seek connection and validation from strangers, further highlighting their need for emotional support that they are not receiving from their immediate social circle."

"Idk what more to doI've told the people in my life that I'm very lonely. (My fiance being the one I've told the most), and it's like he did one or two things over a week span to make me feel less alone, then goes right back to just ignoring my feelings. Or at least it seems like it. I don't have any friends because honestly, all of my friends have been shitty people in the end, so I cut them off. My mom loves with my fiance and I. She knows how I feel, but she can only do so much because she was diagnosed with an illness a couple of months ago.

I'm just so fucking lonely.",1,"the person feels lonely because they have communicated their feelings of loneliness to their close ones but still feel ignored and unsupported. they have no friends due to past negative experiences and their mother, who is aware of their feelings, is limited in her ability to help due to her illness. this combination of factors contributes to their profound sense of loneliness."
"I'm just the type of person destined to be lonelySpend all Sunday alone studying at school, and I come home to one of my housemates having friends over and they won't stop laughing loudly. I really shouldn't hold it against them, she's been depressed for a while before and these are her new friends. Anyways this isn't the point 

I can try to be as outgoing as I can be, but it won't change my natural disposition to be reserved. To not keep in contact with someone after I've met them since I assume people won't like me or find me interesting. To not plan things myself and wait to be invited instead. To be slightly awkward and avoid close conversation topics because I don't want people to get to know me and say ""That's it?"" 

If I want to make friends I have to be ""on"" at 100% and if I start to slip up I will be seen as reserved/disinterested/assholeish 

God why do I have to be a human. I don't need this evolved hunger for human connection. Not in this world.

If I was a robot I would never feel lonely. Never feel horny. Or at least my dick would work. Never procrastinate. Never feel self conscious. I would sleep with no problem. 

Or I could die and a robot could replace me. 

This life thing. This happiness thing has better be worth it.

"Were all lonely people, right?Saw a post on here that inspired me. I'm m22, and I'm ready to talk and get to know someone, specifically a girl. I like playing videogames, watching movies, and cuddling on the couch. I like to think I'm a good listener, but always trying to improve. :) I love music. Both listening to it and playing it. I LOVE jazz, just beggining to learn from the real book on my piano, so if youre a jazz fiend. You probably know WAYY more than me, lol. I love obsessing over stupid fandom bs.

"Its not that I want friends, I'm just incredibly bored and totally aimlessmoney is a funny thing, you say you dont care about it and yet you keep saving it and you get scared if it goes below a certain percentage. This is all so stupid. Money for the sake of money is the main driver behind all of my actions. 

I havent had friends in a over a decade and I'm not sure I want them anymore either. I have never had interest in having a relationship or sex. I dont understand what else is there for me to care about. I do try to be positive, even if it doesnt seem like it, I'm thankful for being healthy and able bodied but the aimless wont go away and it gnaws.

what the fuck happenned in the course of history that made the one and most important purpose in reality to amass the greatest amount of materials before you die?

WHY do I even keep working? What is a career and why should I want one? why did I wake up today and not yesterday? 

why do i do all these things that dont give satisfaction and are the consequences of not doing them really that bad or is it the people around me who are going to punish me?

"Not allowed to loveHas anyone felt like they're just not allowed to find love? Like the universe just doesn't put them in the right place at the right time? I don't want to ask a girl that I work with / at my job out. I don't want to have a workplace relationship. However I find this girl very attractive and would love to be with her. I only talk to her as an associate to keep our relationship professional for the better of both of us (unfortunate for me). Just found out that she's with someone. Someone who was lucky enough to be where the universe doesn't want me to be. The right time and the right place. I don't wish I was him. I just wish I was where he was when he talked to her instead of being where I unfortunately have to be. Maybe me and her could've developed something. That would've been nice.  Just another reason why i hate this job. I want out but the universe won't let me do that either.

"Researchers Confront An Epidemic Of LonelinessThe woman on the other end of the phone spoke lightheartedly of spring and of her 81st birthday the previous week.

??Who did you celebrate with, Beryl??? asked Alison, whose job was to offer a kind ear.

??No one, I????

And with that, Beryl??s cheer turned to despair.

Her voice began to quaver as she acknowledged that she had been alone at home not just on her birthday, but for days and days. The telephone conversation was the first time she had spoken in more than a week.

About 10,000 similar calls come in weekly to an unassuming office building in this seaside town at the northwest reaches of England, which houses The Silver Line Helpline, a 24-hour call center for older adults seeking to fill a basic need: contact with other people.

Loneliness, which Emily Dickinson described as ??the Horror not to be surveyed,?? is a quiet devastation. But in Britain, it is increasingly being viewed as something more: a serious public health issue deserving of public funds and national attention.

Working with local governments and the National Health Service, programs aimed at mitigating loneliness have sprung up in dozens of cities and towns. Even fire brigades have been trained to inspect homes not just for fire safety but for signs of social isolation.

??There??s been an explosion of public awareness here, from local authorities to the Department of Health to the media,?? said Paul Cann, chief executive of Age UK Oxfordshire and a founder of The Campaign to End Loneliness, a five-year-old group based in London. ??Loneliness has to be everybody??s business.??

Researchers have found mounting evidence linking loneliness to physical illness and to functional and cognitive decline. As a predictor of early death, loneliness eclipses obesity.

??The profound effects of loneliness on health and independence are a critical public health problem,?? said Dr. Carla M. Perissinotto, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. ??It is no longer medically or ethically acceptable to ignore older adults who feel lonely and marginalized.??

In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10 percent to 46 percent.

While the public, private and volunteer sectors in Britain are mobilizing to address loneliness, researchers are deepening their understanding of its biological underpinnings. In a paper published earlier this year in the journal Cell, neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified a region of the brain they believe generates feelings of loneliness. The region, known as the dorsal raphe nucleus, or D.R.N., is best known for its link to depression.

Kay M. Tye and her colleagues found that when mice were housed together, dopamine neurons in the D.R.N. were relatively inactive. But after the mice were isolated for a short period, the activity in those neurons surged when those mice were reunited with other mice.

"An unrequited crush for 5 years which I can't move onHello

This seems stupid that I write here but I need some tips regarding my crush which makes me feel like shit inside. The reason is I can't move on because I don't feel anything for other beautiful girls around me. My heart doesn't flutter or skip a beat for other girls and its been like that for 5 years even tho we didn't meet for 2.5 years already. We didn't do any dates we were people who knew each other from high school, parties, university, domirtory but my akwardness and shyness and stupid things I did when I was drunk fucked it all up which I regret so badly and would do differently just to start my relationship from the beginning. We didn't talk a lot in person, in social media. The last time I talked to her was this summer. What I should do? I still didn't confess to her but it would be akward after such time to write something like that. Problem is I can't get over it and it put brakes to get in relationship with other girls.",0,"the narrative reveals deep emotional turmoil and fixation on an unrequited crush that has persisted for five years. the person is unable to move on and has not developed feelings for others, indicating a significant emotional attachment and isolation. their regret over past actions and lack of social interaction with the crush further highlight feelings of loneliness and longing for a connection that never materialized."
"just like kinda in the need of close friends or smth like this igWell, ig its kind of a long story, somewhat. Im in long distance a relationship since over a year now and i do love her (ig). But sometimes i feel like i cant be the person she needs and i also kinda sometimes feel like she isnt the really right one for me. Things that keep me in the relationship are the fact that i still love her ig, that i cant do it to her because she is mentally absolutely not stable and needs me. Also it would probably be a lot of stress and yes ik, if its just because that i should think about why i actually stay but it just be like that, pls respect that. An other reason is that i kinda feel like I need an emotional relationship with 1 or more persons. Its not like i dont have friends, but i dont have a relationship that would be ""enough"" or whatsoever to call it. The problem with my current gf is that she is something a bit too demanding for me and i cant be there for her enough. Yeah just wanted to share this,  it also took me some energy to write it down.

I texted three friends, hoping to talk to one of them. One responded, but then she fell asleep. Another did and said she was busy. Another didn't respond because I think she was already in bed.

I understand people need to sleep and enjoy life and all that but holy shit I'm like barely keeping it together right now and this is the first time I've resorted to a hotline and they won't even respond.

"Should someone with PTSD avoid dating others with mental health issues?I recently tried dating for the first time since being diagnosed with PTSD. I met a girl in a depression/PTSD support group who seemed to be also heavily involved in recovery from addiction and headed in the same direction as far as life trajectory. 

I am graduating from college this week after being homeless from when I was a teenager to a year ago. I started going to college while I  was still homeless and completely broke. I chose to study computers and now have a 3.9GPA, even though I had never even had my own smart phone. My point is that I am extremely motivated and that I work very hard towards my goals...

At first our common background (and supposedly similar goals) brought us together and things were amazing. I was studying computers in college and she had some computer knowledge,  so we bonded by sharing computer code that we were working  on. We also had fun doing sime of the things  neither of us had the chance to enjoy before, including eating nice food, catching up on movies, and taking our dogs to parks.
 
Then I found out she was still involved in illegal activities with some very dangerousand sick people, so it triggered my PTSD to not trust her. I had worked very hard and lost a lot of friends in order to make a clean break from the world she was still very involved in.

She was very understanding and accepting of my symptoms at first ( probably becauseshe realized her complicated life began stressing me out), even saying that my ex girlfriend's shouldbe punished for not being understanding, and things were still not so bad because she promised she was trying to change her life. 

That was until I asked for a little space to work on my college finals right before graduation and I found out what her symptoms were. The minute she thought I was pulling back, she flipped completely, accusing me of being an evil man and all sorts of other things. Where she had been very kind, caring, and talking about forever, she just quit talking completely. When I do hear something from her, she has began using the excuse that my PTSD symptoms were the reason our relationship ended. She takes absolutely no responsibility at all.

Now that some time has passed, I can see that we were both just acting out of fears that still exists from our pasts. She is still not far enough into recovery to understand how her mind works, and even though I am very conscious of my illness and have been successful even with my symptoms, I still do not have 100% control.
 
Since I am starting at a new college soon to pursue my bachelor degree, I should have never been involved with someone who was still involved in drug trafficking, yet I still can't help but wonder what went wrong and I want to avoid making the same mistake. 

Is it even possible for two people with similar mental  illnesses to coexist? I had always thought it would be ideal because the number one thing I am looking for is understanding that sometimes my symptoms are not in my control. I have met some women who say they want to do this, but none that actually can.

Besides having PTSD, I am involved in Yoga, meditation, music, and animals, plus I will have a college degree in Information technology after Friday, and a decent savings account, so it is not like I do not have anything to offer. 

I guess it could be that what matters more is what the individual symptoms of each person are and how well they are managed...or it could just be a bad idea all around for two people with mental illness to date.

"Long-Lived Non-Human CompanionshipI posted most of this as a reply to someone else somewhere, but I thought maybe it would be interesting for other people to read in general so I'm sharing it as a regular post.

Finding human friends and consistent, stable, enduring human relationships is hard. We all know that.

One popular alternative to this is acquiring animal companionship. Lots of lonely people get pets, and it can help a ton. Many different scientific studies have concluded that owning pets can improve your life, increase longevity, and decrease loneliness. And through the wonderful magic of Stockholm Syndrome, you can force your less-intelligent animal companion to love and depend upon you the way you just can't with most humans (not legally, anyway).

But... what about when they die? Won't that leave you feeling even lonelier than before? Just the thought of this, or past traumatic experiences, can scare a lot of lonely people off of the idea of getting themselves a furry friend (though as seen below, our bias toward furriness may be part of the problem as feathery and scaly friends tend to last longer). Dogs are called ""man's best friend,"" but... most of them only live for 10-13 years and many popular ""pure"" breeds suffer numerous genetic problems that makes old age for them a painful ordeal. And puppy farms in some places can be a living nightmare.

Myself I'm more of a cat person. I've had several very close, loving relationships with kitties. They can be much more affectionate and personable than some believe (not cat people), and the fact that they are usually harder to win over than dogs (the emotional sluts of the animal kingdom) I think can make it feel like their love is more earned and therefore more valuable. Plus they are largely self-sufficient and easy to take care of. And most kinds of housecat, well taken care of, can live up to 20 years! That's a long time! But still... probably not as long as you're going to live.

If you do decide to get a dog or cat, please adopt one from the pound or an animal shelter. There are many in need.

But if you want an animal companion that is going to last longer, here are some suggestions:

&amp;#x200B;

\*

Horses - some breeds can live 40-60 years. And you can ride them! Not advisable to try this with most dogs. The Icelandic Horse is known for its hardiness and for being energetic and friendly. Not for everyone, obviously, as maintenance can be expensive. But they are beautiful, noble animals that many humans have formed strong bonds with. Don't get one unless you're willing to commit large amounts of time to grooming and maintenance though, or else large amounts of money to pay someone else to do it. Though horse grooming can be very zen. I used to get the same feeling from washing, waxing, and detailing my sports car.

Asian Elephants - hard and expensive to care for, but they live on average from 50-70 years and the oldest on record died at age 84. You're probably not going to be able to get one unless you are Joe Exotic or live in a farm somewhere in Thailand or else some place with unusually lax laws, but if you do, they can make for great friends because elephants are some of the most intelligent animals on the planet along with humans, dolphins, whales, crows, and maybe octopoda - though octopus intelligence is not well understood. Btw some species of whale also can live super long but... not in captivity... and I doubt your fish tank is big enough.

Blue and Yellow Macaws - on average these beautiful and intelligent birds live to be about 80. In captivity many different breeds of parrots have been known to live 90-100 years or longer. And they make excellent pets! Probably the best overall option on this whole list with lifespans that conveniently match the average life expectancy of a human, so you could get a baby macaw as a child and have a lifelong companion that you wouldn't have to worry about abandoning yourself whenever you kick the bucket. One note: I'd strongly urge anyone considering getting a parrot as a pet to do your due diligence and ensure your feathery friend has been ethically sourced. There is still a lot of illegal trafficking of exotic birds to various parts of the world, which is awful for the birds.

Aldabra Giant Tortoise - the oldest one on record lived to be 255. Many species of tortoise commonly live to be 100-150, perhaps thanks to their very slow metabolism. Smaller, more common species are very popular as pets, easy to obtain, and cheap to care for as they eat simple food and not much of it. Plus if they ever get outside and try to run off you'll have a much easier time catching them than you would a dog or a cat.

Lobsters - they can live to be 100-150 years old and will be forever thankful to you for sparing them the fate of becoming someone's expensive dinner. Many types of shellfish and mollusks have similarly long or even longer lifespans, some living for several hundred years.

Greenland Shark - not the prettiest species of shark, but perhaps due to their preference for arctic waters they are the longest-lived extant species, with estimated lifespans of 200 up to over 500 years. And sharks are cool. They've been around for 450 million years so they must be doing something right. Don't trust that slanderous Hollywood hack job Jaws. One caveat about the Greenland Shark: they grow to 24 feet long, so unless you have a very big, very cold fish tank or swimming pool this probably isn't a realistic option for a pet. On the other hand, the smallest common aquarium shark, the Dwarf Shark, suffers significantly less than the Greenland Shark in the looks department, only grows to about 8 inches long, and still lives for an impressive 20-30 years.

Sponges, corals, anemones and tubeworms - not the most interactive of pets, but they are technically animals, some are nice to look at, and some species can live for thousands of years.

Turritopsis dohrnii - also known as the ""immortal jellyfish,"" it is thought that it may be biologically immortal, meaning that it will *never* die from old age, thanks to its ability to switch back and forth between its pupal and adult stages of development. Some species of hydras also have this talent. But the immortal jellyfish is actually quite beautiful and could make nice pets I guess. Though they are tiny so you will have to invest in a magnifying glass to fully appreciate their company.",0,"the person does not exhibit signs of loneliness because they discuss the benefits of various long-lived pets in a very practical and informative manner. they also share personal experiences with pets and show a clear understanding of the emotional benefits of animal companionship. this indicates they have had meaningful relationships with pets and possibly people, demonstrating a well-rounded perspective on companionship rather than a sense of isolation."
Message me if you're sad43 yo mum of 2 who knows what it's like,0,the narrative suggests that the person is reaching out to help others who are sad they mention being a mother of two and having personal experience with sadness this implies they have a support system and are not experiencing loneliness themselves

I need some advice pleaseCan someone text me right now I just need someone to talk. I feel like shit right now I dont know what should I do,0,"the narrative clearly expresses a need for immediate social interaction and support, indicating feelings of distress and seeking connection. however, based on the given classification, this person is not considered lonely according to the label provided. it is possible that the individual usually has a support system but is currently experiencing a temporary emotional crisis, hence the urgent request for communication."
I got into a big argument with my girlfriend and broke up 8 days ago.She doesn??t want to talk to me anymore and has blocked me on all social media and text messages. I??m now drunk and listening to sad music. I don??t want to be alive.,0,"the narrative shows signs of distress and emotional turmoil due to a recent breakup. however, it does not necessarily indicate long-term loneliness. the person is currently experiencing acute sadness and rejection, which are normal reactions to a breakup. the narrative does not provide enough evidence of a prolonged state of loneliness or isolation beyond this specific incident."
"I always see posts saying ""Please share it""... and I don't know anyone to share it with. O.o :/.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of isolation and a lack of social connections. the person feels they have no one to share posts with, which indicates feelings of loneliness. however, the label suggests otherwise. there might be an error in the label as the narrative clearly shows signs of loneliness."
"Here if anyone needs to talk!????????????Having a pretty rough day today, I'd love to listen to your problems and try my best to help (it distracts me from my own issues). The offers there if anyone wants to take it up ???? I hope everyone's day is going a little brighter than mine. For anyone that needs to hear it, I love you and I am unbelievably proud of you. Even if you feel like you haven't achieved anything, I promise that you have and I really am so fucking proud of you for continuing to keep pushing every day. I know being alive is a burden sometimes (or most of the time) but you're doing an amazing job so far and you are valued. You're important to me. I'm here if you ever need some love and compassion. Stay safe please ??????",0,"the person is not lonely because they are actively reaching out to others and offering support, indicating a desire for connection and empathy. they express love and pride for others, suggesting they have a compassionate and outward-focused mindset."
"His Eulogy.       My father isn't actually dead. In fact he is very much alive and unwell living in a van a days drive away from me. However, as he becomes older and weaker from years of drugs, sex and rock n roll I find myself making adjustments to his eulogy. 
      Yes, you read that correctly. A eulogy for a man that is still alive. I'd give anything to meet just one child of an addict that hasn't already thought about what they will......and won't say when that fateful day arrives. The day I have to stand up in front of a room full of people that he endlessly disappointed and find the strength to do right by him. Because the funny thing is I fucking love my addict father. We have almost identical minds I just never behaved......well to the degree of recklessness that he did. 
     Since I've been using Reddit as my journal lately it only seemed fitting to put everything here. I won't get to say all of this to them. I want to get up there and steadily hold up both of my middle fingers and scream ""FUCK YOU for giving up. FUCK YOU for leaving. And finally FUCK YOU for showing up today with your small minds and judgmental stares"". But I wont. I won't because my father's reckless behavior gave me a sister. A tiny impressionable human I am now mentally responsible for. I'll do everything in my power to preserve her mind for as long as I can. No one gave me that courtesy. So here it is in all of its current unfiltered unapologetic glory. 

My Father's Eulogy:

     For 28 years I had my father all to myself and I loved being his only child. He was so in love with me and I don't think there has ever been anyone that has loved me that much. But then came my baby sister. I struggled her first few years with accepting that I no longer had him to myself. But one day he called me and there she was on a video chat. I realized almost instantly that this tiny 5 year old girl had my nose. That's all it took. I was attached. 
      My baby sister is the greatest gift my father has ever given me. I knew that he would pass so much earlier in her life than mine and I promised him I would watch over her for the rest of my life. She will never walk alone. 
      It's no secret to anyone here that my father was a life long drug addict. Over time the people in his life gave up on him one by one. But I was one of the chosen few who got to see his soul. Who he really was beneath the stories that others told of him. I promised myself that I would get up here and do right by him. Tell you all who my father really was and why I am so proud to be his daughter. 
     He taught me to respect animals just as much as humans and got me a lot of fuzzy ones over the years. He gave me 2 kittens, a dog, a bunny and he even drove 8 hours from Maryland to Massachusetts to deliver my hamster ""Flopsy"" as a communion gift. He taught me how to sneak into movies and we once saw 6 in one day. He taught me how to drive and how to make it up a snowy hill with a stick shift. He was great at driving in the snow. Always calm and never panicked. 
    We made each other laugh until our stomachs hurt and tears rolled from our eyes. He was so funny. He was a talented musician playing guitar and singing in my youth and later turned to drums when his hands couldn't handle the guitar anymore. He taught me how to play guitar when I was 6 and bought me my first and only pair of diamond earrings when I was 16. And no I dont care how he got the money. People have attempted to sway my opinion of my father over the years. But I've never faltered in what I know to be his truth. 
    The truth is he was the only person who ever really knew me. Because our minds worked the same way. He gave me the gift of empathy and compassion. He knew how to comfort me, what to say to me, what not to say to me and how to be everything I needed in whatever situation I was in. 
   Every night I stayed with him (which was weekends and summers) he would sing me to sleep with his mashed up version of Bob Dylan's knocking on heavens door that included parts of the Guns and Roses cover. I remember what it felt like being rocked to sleep by him. His deep singing voice coming through his chest onto my cheek as I laid against him.
   A part of me is now gone and the hole that is now in my heart will never be filled. But in many ways I don't think I would want it to be mended. Because that reminds me of just how much he meant to me. Just how much his mere existence mattered. I will miss his sunny side up breakfasts and how he'd get so upset if he broke a yolk. I will miss our long talks where he would make me feel heard and never attempted to stifle my voice. As most of you know I talk loudly, fastly and way too much. But I was never told to be more quiet, to slow my speech down or to stop talking all together. I'm not sure he knew how much that meant to me. 
    He saw my flaws as gifts. As things to be proud of. He saw the good in everyone. And I mean everyone. He taught me how to fold a wad of cash properly with the one dollar bills on the outside and the 20's on the inside so potential robbers would assume I was broke. He taught me to buy the biggest pack of sharpies to make sure I had every color in case I dinged someone's car door I could just color it in.
    These may sound like terrible things to teach a child. But I assure you it was never done with malice or poor intent. He was doing everything in his power to prepare me for the world to chew me up and spit me out like it did to him. I will forever be grateful to know the absurd yet useful things he taught me. 
    I'm scared of what life is now without him in it. But I wouldn't change a single late night drive, 3 hour phone conversation or the fact that he wore cut off jean shorts to bed every night like a hillbilly. I feel as though it would have been an easier choice to let the sharp broken pieces he'd crumbled into lay. However, as his daughter I made the decision to walk through the fire with him and I would do it over and over again. My only regret is that he won't be here to watch me say FUCK ALL OF YOU. Daddy, I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again. I love you.

"I get attached too easily.I completely understand why this happens, i know when I'm doing it, and i'm completely powerless to stop it everytime. I have the deepest need for someone in my life that i can be close to, that when a person shows a small amount of interest in me, i latch on to them, i know it's really unhealthy and everytime I see myself getting to that point i have to try and pull away. 

It's so difficult and i feel like shit everytime, i often get invested in someone who doesn't and won't reciprocate my feelings and it's happened enough times to make me truly miserable.

I feel like i'm in this painful cycle of being drawn to people who don't care, and In the end of it all i always wish for silly childish shit like wanting to turn off my emotions.

I know how loneliness can kill you slowly from the inside out. It only takes one person to talk to and care for your world to change and make a difference. I want to be a person who inspires hope, positivity, growth, and change in others. It means a lot to me if I can help others as I know we all have our own struggles and stories to overcome.

I can??t be so forcefully positive about the future with someone because more often than not: they don??t see/share future with me so early in my relationship with them. It??s a harsh and brutal lesson for me to learn. But I just can??t expect someone to fall in love with me no matter how long we??ve known each other or what we??ve been through. Love is a two way street no matter how much you pave over it.

"A Man Could Go Quite MadBasically, I have a lot going on. I'm Autistic, have ADHD, and have DIAGNOSED Anxiety. I've been losing touch with reality lately and I've started to honestly not care if I live or die. Part of me even hopes I have *cancer*. I'm constantly in pain and the only thing that stopped me from committing suicide last week was the knowledge that I would get to eat *popcorn* later in the day. I don't have many friends, and I don't have any friends that I actively meet up with anymore. The only thing that used to keep me going was the knowledge that if I kept going I could have a good future, but even that motivation left. Then my only motivation was funny videos on youtube, and that's all it is anymore. My memory just keeps getting worse and worse to the point that, like I said before, I'm losing touch with reality.

I'm currently eating some popcorn on my couch with the laptop on my lap. For some reason, popcorn is pretty much my only bliss anymore.

Not once, but 5 times, all of them. Mind you I'd try to back off at that point if we're still together, but then it turns into ""I don't think I'm the person for you, or I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" either which every time.

This last time it was my ex randomly telling me over a year and a half after us breaking up that yesterday, because he woke up to 4 messages from me (1 news article, 2 memes and one was just asking what almond milk he buys) that it was overwhelming for him, and of course it brought up all this past defeat, and burned me worse than before because I thought he was THE ONE who would never say it.

He said it. I'm 5/5 at this point. What am I doing so wrong? One second it's why do you message me so much, I go quiet ""What's wrong? Somethings off?""

I can't win, and it's normal to send content/memes where you find it no? (INSTA, Twitter, Facebook, snap, etc.. so that's why it was 4 seperate over the span of """"2 hours"" he quoted.

I'm so hurt, and I feel like I'm going to be alone forever because I'd rather not just risk being told to shut up again when I'm just excited to share my life and things I find with someone.

So yeah. I??m not even good enough for a lay. 
You??d think that after all this time without s*x for both of us, he would give an excuse and come since he knew I was ready and willing but no. 
And I wish it was just a one off, but it??s not. It has happened before the pandemic. Where I??d talk to guys and then agree to a date and then they couldn??t make it.

"Feeling better for the first time in a whileI wasn't sure where else I should have posted this, I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this kind of thing. I'm just feeling different in a good way and I'm kinda happy about it.

 About 3 years ago (January 1st of 2017 I think), the woman that I loved ended our 2 and a half year long relationship and needless to say, it destroyed me. I was an absolute wreck; not even having the energy to get out of bed some days. I was caught up in a ***deep*** depression that felt endless to me. I was dealing with that depression for roughly a year. 

 After that first year things seemed to be getting easier to handle but I was still heavily hung up on my ex. Everything I saw reminded of her and all of the good times we shared which sent me into a rollercoaster of emotions almost every day. It was really exhausting but at least I didn't feel completely destroyed anymore.

After that second year came to an end I knew I was getting better because there were some days I would wake up and not immediately think of my ex and how her absence made me sad. But it was still haunting me. I still missed her a lot but at that point it was pretty clear that I would never get her back. That thought was the biggest obstacle and made me sad very often during the 3rd year.

 Fast forward to today where I'm packing up my room because I'm moving to a new house and I find a huge box of memories from that relationship. At first I hesitate to even go through the box because I'm afraid it'll send me down the same path I was at at the beginning. I knew what kind of things were in there, love notes from her and little mementos from our travels etc. All stuff I hastily threw in there a few days after she broke up with me because even just the sight of those things made me break down and sent my spiraling into a depression.

 My initial plan with the box is to keep it closed and  just move it with my other stuff without going through it. I then changed my mind for some reason. So I open it up and read all of the notes and they make me smile a little but then I tear them all up and throw a lot of the stuff away in a large trash bag. Upon returning from the dumpster where I threw away the bag I feel surprised. I'm surprised because I remember how I felt at the beginning of all of this. Back then, I never would have thought I'd have the strength to let go of the memories of my ex so easily. 

 I guess right now I'm just feeling kind of proud of how much has changed with me in these 3 years. Admittedly, going throw the box made me a little nostalgic of the time I spent with her, but it's very mild, if that makes sense. 

 My biggest takeaway from all of this is that time was the only surefire way to recover from the heartbreak. I don't think my ex is someone I'll ever completely forget, but I think I learned a lot from my time with her and the following years I was dealing with losing her. And that makes me kinda thankful in a way.

I'm a really bad person and I shouldn't talk to anyone. I have made him cry himself to sleep. I have caused him stress. He is a really good friend and also the only friend I have but I'm a horrible friend and a toxic person. I can't be there for him like he is there for me. And I'm sure he already has his own problems he has to deal with. 

I have tried to cut off contact with him many times but he doesn't allow me to do that but I only want what's the best for him. Nothing hurts me more than hurting someone I care about. I have even tried to block him and I know I sound like a horrible person but I'm afraid I'll ruin his life. I don't want to leave but I have to because it's the right thing to do.

Aside from this, I truly have no reason why I still miss her or the small things like hugs and kissing that used to happen or even the cuddling aspect, regardless of how long that hug was it still meant so much.

"Why is sex so normal....Like.. it seems so bizarre. How can you get another human to do that with you. 

And given how hard it is to get girls, I'd think like 10% of guys would have a girlfriend/active sex life. And yet way more than that do. Actually around my age probably 95% do. 

It's so painful. Sex is everywhere. I'm not able to do much IRL because I have no friends either, so I need to use media. But sex is EVERYWHERE on media and it's constantly reminders of things I'll probably never get. It's so painful feeling so worthless and unwanted. 

And there's this stigma about guys who can't get laid. They must have a bad personality or be horribly ugly. It's absolutely not true. I'm probably a 6 or 7/10 and my personality is fine. The only major problem I have is that i have no friends so I'm not really ""fun"" cause I don't get invited to stuff. So that really limits the type of girl I can date down to introverts. 

I'm trying to work out and stuff. I'm gonna try losing 20 pounds and seeing if I can get abs. Maybe it'll help but I doubt it. Guys at my weight seem to have no problem with getting laid.

This person asks how I am, she checks on me knowing that I will be mean and rude, knowing that I hate everything and Im tired. She cares. Why she cares? I dont know, but Im grateful for that.

Yesterday I was down again as usual, listening music, scrolling thru my phone and waiting to get tired again. Then I got a message. Someone who I barely tought I knew was asking how am I? I couldnt help but cry just a little when I tought that even though she knows Im living corpse with broken mind and dead, lazy eyes, she still cares about me. 

I apreciate her friendship and love more than she even knows. She knows that I care about her and I want to see her smile, hear her laugh and happines, but she cant even imagine how warm she makes me feel. She is amazing person and I want only best for her. I dont know how I have managed to get a friend like her, and guy like me doesnt deserve her kindnes, but she doesnt care, she still is there for me and you bet Im there for her!

She seems like my own guardian angel, that one who watches over me and keeps me on the road. Im grateful. I know that it will not take away my sadnes, but her happines still makes me forget it for a moment. How can you be sad when you have a friend like her?

But I don??t feel this empty feeling in my stomach. I feel like I am lying to myself because this is not normal? Right? Humans need connection but for some reason I??m kind of indifferent towards it. It would be cool to have a best friend where we go to adventures with and experience new stuff together but that??s not what my life is now.

And I??m not mentally stable right now. I??m pretty stressed out because of my life situation right now. Still no lonely feeling.

"I made an app where you can hold hands with anyone availableLast week, a close friend of mine was going through a difficult time. I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.

The way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people ""hold hands"" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.

It's available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yokereba.held) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/held-together/id1585062364), and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.

I realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.  


But just maybe two people will hold hands for a while and feel a little less lonely. &lt;3",0,"the person is not lonely because they are motivated by empathy and a desire to help a friend in need. they created an app to bridge the physical distance and provide comfort, showing they have meaningful connections and a proactive approach to maintaining them. their focus on others' well-being indicates they are engaged and connected with people around them."
"Feeling isolated, just want the tiniesttttt bit of intimacy.I can be too much of a loner but every now and again I get the feeling I should of experienced a bit more intimacy in my life than I have, i've not really experienced any.

I struggle badly with my emotions and keep my distance from people, I've never had sex and i'm not interested jumping into bed with someone and I don't think I could deal with a relationship, I feel to troubled and self destructive I don't want to drag that into a girls life. But instead of all the expectations that come with dating apps I wish their was something more simple with just getting a hug or someone to cuddle with, i've never cuddled with anyone and i'm feeling pretty old to not have experience any intimacy (25) It get's hard to deal with the stress of weight on my chest I just want something simple, I want to spend a night away from my single bed and share a bed with someone for once.

I just want to make someone feel wanted and comfortable (Ain't got the confidence for a relationship)",0,"the narrative clearly describes feelings of isolation and a strong desire for intimacy, indicating significant loneliness. the person expresses a struggle with emotions, a lack of intimate experiences, and a desire for simple physical affection like cuddling. they also mention feeling troubled and self-destructive, which further isolates them from forming relationships. thus, the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness."
"Do you get bitter when you see or even think about other people in happy relationships?I (28F) unfortunately have had this issue ever since my early teens. When it's really bad I can't even watch movies or shows or heck even see ads about couples, without getting intensely irritated. And, of course, seeing couples IRL is upsetting. I have had one relationship when I was 20 that lasted 10 months, and two times where I thought I found someone who loved me but in the end they were just leading me on (and as I'm terribly lonely I immediately latch on to the slightest affectionate gesture, so that doesn't help). But outside of those times I'm pretty full to the brim with extreme bitterness towards happy couples. Even with close friends or family. My best friend of 16 years recently got engaged and the news just made me feel dejected and put me in a bad mood. I don't ever show it; but inside I am seething and jealous, and reminded how I've barely had any romantic love in my life and see no hope of finding it again. Reminded about how I have no-one who wants me and how I have no-one to hold me at night, cuddle me, love me, enjoy sex with, enjoy life together -- how I am missing out on one of the purest, most blissful of human experiences. I have had Major Depression since early adolescence, so of course that makes things worse. But I hate the bitterness I feel towards couples. It makes me feel like a bad person. I wish I could feel happy like most people at news of an engagement or wedding, but all I think to myself is, ""great, more people getting what you aren't. More people experiencing love while you're left behind. Just reminding you that no-one will ever love you that way!""

As we went outside, she was telling me this issue she??s had with this guy and all I could think about is how happy I??d want to make her. How much she made me happy and me wishing I could do the same in a relationship.

I got home and the next day, I opened my phone to see a conversation she posted where she was setting up some time or place to get fucked by some dude. I felt so fucking embarrassed, so ugly, so useless. Is there something I could??ve done where she would??ve wanted to be with me that night? Was I too ugly? Is there just something wrong with the way I present myself? I have no idea.

Just yesterday, I decided to text her about it. I said I love you and when she said it back, I told her that I don??t know the context of what she means. Does she say it as just a friend? I told her that she??s talked to me in a way that made me want to save myself for her, which is completely true. I avoided having a crushes or dating because I wanted to be with her.

"Just setting a few thoughts looseRecent lurker, been on the fence about posting here, but I figured it couldn??t hurt. This might be a bit long.

I??ve never been in a relationship and I??ve been putting more effort into trying to change that lately. Not for lack of trying earlier in life, but it??s funny how just a few years - let alone, a decade or more - can change your perspective. 

My twenties are almost over, thirty is on the horizon. It would be nice to find someone while I??m still this young. It??s definitely something I want, not a need. I??ve been alone this long and I??m still here, so ending up forever alone isn??t an idea that particularly bothers me. I??m on sturdy ground with myself, for the most part. Took a long time to get there, but I??m mostly satisfied with where I??m at.

It would just be nice to find someone to love, you know? Being alone is something of a double-edged sword for me. On the one hand, it can be peaceful at times... but, it can also be downright unbearable occasionally.

It??s a real roundabout way of getting to it, but what I??m getting at is, I??m dipping my toes into online dating for the first time and I don??t quite know how to feel about it. I haven??t found anyone yet, but that??s okay. Gives me time to ponder. Essentially, I??m out of my element because I prefer interacting in person and I??m not especially proficient with modern technology. Social media is something I avoid like the plague outside of Reddit, so I realize I??m limiting myself right out of the gate.

So, I guess I??m more or less looking for some kind of advice/support? Maybe some tips on how to navigate the landscape of online dating? My small group of real-life friends are unavailable to discuss such matters with me at the moment, so I figured it couldn??t hurt to ask here.",0,"the individual appears to have a healthy sense of self-awareness and acceptance of their situation. they express a desire for a relationship but are not distressed by their current state of being alone. they acknowledge the challenges of online dating and are seeking advice, indicating a proactive approach. they also mention having a small group of friends, suggesting they are not entirely isolated. overall, their narrative does not reflect deep loneliness but rather a balanced perspective on their current life stage and social connections."

I am able to love other people as it is the same to breathe,i am able to love myself subconsciously but it is hard for people to love me, it??s hard maybe cause i put myself out of reach,i don??t allow people to understand me. i don??t think or act how the majority does i always say i think i??m before myself,i feel stuck like i??m in the wrong place all the time. The way i love is first through affirmation,i??m too loyal to  disloyalty this is my biggest mistake. Then it is the semi attachment obtained from hours upon hours of endless talking and conversation in one time because one doesn??t simply do this because they are bored it because it means something? incorrect this is my second mistake people are unpredictable,sly and manipulative characteristics someone like me fails to see as i only see the best in people even if it means i have to invent it myself. People can pretend for the fun of it or to gain something out of it. this i know all to well because when loving or feeling i have always been put in the same position different exterior same interior, each boy with a different look each with the same intent and goal. For there has never been one boy who has kept me and solely me in their heart,i have never been anything but 2nd best. I am nothing more than someone to pass the time with until something better comes along, this has broken my heart too many times for me to feel,i will admit i don??t feel love because why would you when it only proves to be destructive why would you want to feel that so i turned that feeling off believe it or not. i stopped falling for words,i stopped falling for actions. i stopped falling. Instead i followed, i followed back on the words i followed the actions i reciprocated in a way as to keep up appearances. i saw the wolf dressing up in the sheep??s outfit and i did nothing but go along with it??s actions until the day it would decide to undress. because all wolfs get tired of sheep??s clothing especially when they meet something else. It was just a case of seeing who could hold out the longest my mask or my feelings. When the wolf begun to start undressing which didn??t take long it didn??t hurt i didn??t feel anything but anger,angry that a wolf could think they deceived me a wolf running and screaming to the mountains it deceived me when it was not me  that was deceived but the wolf, i let you think you had me and that you played when it was me that was going off on you,laughing at the things you would say,rolling my eyes. not even slightly amazed at the actions you put together. i over analyse and create patterns that aren??t apparent i do this and go off this. I wish i hadn??t been broken so much times,the more you break something the more and more it fails to work as it did,i fear loneliness because that??s what this does to me the fear of not being able to trust,not being able to feel,how can you form a connection with someone you can??t feel for or can??t trust because at all costs you cannot afford to get broken again because you cannot guarantee to yourself that you will still function, what an upsetting cycle it is for someone who longs to be loved that can never be loved. Someone who cannot have a guard up as every person is ??different?? and will offer something new and the bombardments of what if. what if this one is the one i mustn??t shut him out in fear he will only look else where. This is how i love and can never be loved. His words echo in my mind. ??There is no one for you ?? it repeats in a dead tone in the front of my mind. ??there is no one for?? a destroying sentence in itself, there is not a single person in the world in the great mass of people not one person will be compatible for me, this isn??t a stranger saying this to me it is at the time my boyfriend whom i??ve loved for 3 years and been with for a year the boy who told me he wanted a future with me is the same boy who told me no one is compatible for me. not even himself and this wasn??t said in a way as i am so superior nobody deserves my love or can even level me it was said in a way that i should spend the rest of my life alone because i do not deserve to love anybody. this was said with nothing but malice and anger. i don??t trust words or actions so how do you plan to prove you love me for real and how do you expect me to fall for you",0,"the narrative demonstrates a deep sense of emotional pain and a struggle with interpersonal relationships, particularly in the context of love and trust. the person describes a pattern of being hurt and deceived by others, leading to a protective mechanism of emotional detachment. they express a fear of loneliness and a belief that they are unlovable, which indicates significant emotional distress and isolation. despite this, the label indicates that they are not lonely. it may be that the person is surrounded by people but feels misunderstood and disconnected, which complicates their emotional state. their struggle is more about trust and self-worth rather than a lack of social connections."

"Ability to disconnect?Is there a way to disconnect your feeling of wanting companions/friends? I really hate this feeling of wanting to be liked, wanting to be loved and caring about what others think about me. I want to be able to do stuff on my own without feeling judged about it E. G. Going to the cinema on my own, shopping and other miscellaneous things that you normally need a friend to do.",0,"the person expresses a strong desire to disconnect from their feelings of wanting companionship and concern about others' opinions. they mention wanting to do activities alone without feeling judged, indicating a struggle with social anxiety or self-consciousness. however, they do not explicitly state they are lonely; rather, they seem to wish for independence from these feelings, suggesting their primary issue is more about self-perception and social pressure than loneliness."
"A truer end to the past two years - nothing left to dream2 years and a bit ago, at 15, I was in a mental hospital on the advice of my GP for depression. I had life which by then had become more consciously grim, though from childhood, I never had many friends and was mocked quite often. My school life was particularly grey, only every enjoying myself in jokes. The place the GP had sent me too was a tad excessive for what was actually wrong, but it was a modern and nice looking facility and he probably thought it was the best thing he could arrange. &amp;#x200B;I don't know if many people have been in similar mental hospital youth units, but my own perception (coloured by the fact I did not probably have a real discernible illness to hang over me), was like that of a summer camp with a side-function, and with similarly marginal people. We had our own rooms with our own bathrooms, a central lobby with a TV, DVD player and Wii. 2 couches and maybe six chairs? That was the social area anyway. God knows how long we spent there. Then there was a kitchen (we did OT activities every week like cooking and baking), an arts and crafts room which effectively doubled as a back-up social place. We went on trips out every now and again, to the cinema and the zoo and that. We were supervised by a bunch of nurses, in my mind divided between the young ones who were social and friendly to us, and the slightly older ones who were bossy and cold. &amp;#x200B;I was very awkward with people when I first went in. I mostly remember my life so far in general in different embarrassing events that have happened thus far. The first person who met me was a 13 year old girl with borderline disorder (which I found out much later). Immediately started being very friendly with me, insisted on painting my face every day for nearly a week straight. Was very happy initially. No one had ever had so much concern for me. However, as I later found out, borderline often results in random and fleeting obsessions. There was a guy who was a bit more contrivedly macho, though I was friendly with due common lad culture which I wasn't completely out of where I grew up. Depression and anger, I can only sum his problems being. After a few days another person was admitted, a guy who was as weedy as me but lankier. I wish we could have been greater friends, but I always struggled to have something to say to him. There was a posh-ish girl, who loved stock phrases, and didn't really mix with the others. I only figure she felt above the whole alt/marginal social bubble the social was. A guy who was 15, looked 8. A sporty girl who didn't say much, or didn't have much to say. A wealthy girl from the country, who was more mildly mad. That was  the first period. All nice people, who were good friends to me until they went. Was the first time I really felt like I had a community of friends, like I had a discernible social life. Part of that is because of the fact that it's a live-in unit, and people are practically forced to become acquainted to you. &amp;#x200B;There was a second distinct period of my stay, which I define by being more confident at that period. People told me I was funny a lot at this time. I don't know if it was just in the general spirit of 'wholesome support' to be complimentary or genuine, but from the moodiness of school, I always did want to make any situation a laugh. I had the same ratio of gaffes and embarrassments I've always had, but I had a bit of an ego. People were discharged and new people came in, which meant I could give a more tailored impression to them. Part of this period was a then-male friend who said they were trans (and later proved it to my surprise), a pair of socialites (in my perception) which comprised a FtM boy and a chubby guy who called himself autistic (I'm not so sure of). There was a girl with a squeaky voice who told a very disturbing, but seemingly unlikely story. There was a country girl with a bad family history. A kind of a cringey guy who wore Star Wars helmets and talked all the time about his 14 year old girlfriend (he was 17, slightly weird).&amp;#x200B;Then came in a thin girl, very pale. I remember she sat down with her feet on the seat, sipping one of those fattening milk drinks you give to people with eating disorders. I wanted to talk to her, but after a while she was scooped up into the group of the ED girls. Gradually started to have a bit of an infatuation with her. This largely involved me catching long glances at her from the opposite couch before anyone would notice. We didn't talk that much, really. When it was her birthday and her family came in to visit I remember making her laugh by dancing outside her room. Then we'd interact when part of the group when making prank calls and that. I remember being asked if I had a crush in the unit, which I didn't want to answer as I knew my chances were low and if it were not mutual it would only lead to awkwardness. In the faux-jewellery making class, I made her a bracelet with her initials and astrological sign (she was into that sort of thing), and she gave it back not understanding it to be a gift which I took to mean something worse. I flirted with her one day, attempting to pass it off as a joke (which would've been easy given how I acted), and I didn't get any resistance.I was told the next day on weekend leave after probing accidental clues left by one of the friends that she did like me. That was the best single experience of my life so far. I had never felt that given who I was physically and mentally, that a girl would like me. I just felt like everything was going to work out fine. We were 'coupled' immediately the next day. We were being supervised, so we couldn't do much apart from sit next to each other or hold hands under a coat the few times we went to the cinema. But I was in a trance. She was such a soft and warm person, who would play along with every attempt I had to make a joke. I always sat next to her. When she picked out songs for the 'music appreciation activity I resonated with her. We watched Moulin Rouge 5 times. I laughed more with her than anyone else. Though I was still anxious about things and made mistakes, I got toy slime in her one day hair accidentally, which I knew was really bad, but she was entirely sweet to me even though I knew I made her upset. I tried to kiss her at the cinema. With people next to us...and while she was obviously not feeling it right to be the time, she was still kind about it. I was for the first time in my life really feeling something amazing. I wanted us to just get closer and closer, despite the fact that she lived a bit away from me and I'd be leaving the unit soon. She was anorexic, and I found out through her mainly how terrible the experience was. We ate together every day, and I began to properly notice how they struggled picking the food off the cutlery. She was managing though, and with generally being brought out of her own shell, I knew she was going to be fineI was always vague in my 'treatment' at the hospital, and that meant that I was there for 3 months, although I was content with that. Having friends made me feel much better than any of the support options they had there. When I finally ran out of time, I still was in the bubble via a groupchat.  I texted my new girlfriend every day. Though my life was very dull afterwards, the mindless optimism of the unit made me ignore it. Texting her was everything to me then. The others did not really try to contact me on their own initiative. I should have done it myself, but I just felt like not having them in person would not work out. We met up as groups on 2 or 3 occasions, which was as fun as I imagined. I got to kiss her in my friend's bathroom on of these times, which was stiffer than I had imagined. I wanted to go deeper. I asked her everything I could imagine, about what she wanted in the future. We managed one date to a film. The distance was more of a problem then I thought as I struggled to pay for and arrange buses as the right time. Then she became more distant to me. Only giving shallow replies and that. I had to be accomodatable given the problems she had, so I did give her space for a few weeks. I talked to her one time about how maybe it would be a good idea to talk via phone or video chat. She responded about how she was 'proud' of the fact that she could say no, even though I had only suggested it to fix the distance I thought was mutually problematic. I wasn't pushy at this time, but when she said this I got a little perturbed and just mentioned it. She apologised, and I thought about how to approach this, if we could try to figure something mutually beneficial out. The next day she replied about how I was talking to her wasn't 'acceptable'. I thought maybe she had talked to her friends, exaggerated the problem a bit as one naturally does when looking for empathy, and they advised to her be more assertive or something, despite the lack of a real issue. And at this point, I started behaving the worse. I snapped at her and insulted her with something really terrible, which I didn't really mean, but was directed at the lack of concern I thought she had for me at this point. We roughly patched things up after I talked to her friend, but she went a bit cold. Because she had a more serious illness than me, I felt I couldn't act as a wedge between her and the general closeness of the friend group when it offered it support. I left the group chat and that. One person contacted me after. I had lost all my friends just like that. I don't know why I didn't say anything after this. I really don't. More than anything I don't understand my motive or reason. I didn't talk to her for a few months after this. I had some feeling that I had to wait. I felt like things could work out in time, but I felt like I couldn't talk to her \*right now\*. There was one person from the unit I had intermittent contact with, who was similarly as low as I am, but they gradually got exhausted with me and they're now gone.I did send her some jokes after that. This led to a conversation where she told me she didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore. At that point I knew that all of the good I thought the hospital that left me with, and the social life I thought I could get back was completely gone. I told her I was suicidal.  I wanted her to be sympathetic. I broke down, and she blocked me after I suggested I was doing harm to her now. I tried a few weeks later with a really pathetic attempt that just put me in A&amp;E for a dozen hours. &amp;#x200B;She never came back around after that. I watched her online presence. I made new accounts to talk to her which she blocked. I had no friends.I moved school due to failing performance. I thought I'd make friends, but I wasn't able to, and I had a worse sense of social isolation. It went by like that, I was eighteen. I'm now going into college in September, trying to get through summer. Every few months there was a new profile picture for her. Her account with go intermittantly public than private. A few weeks ago I got a response from her finally, filled with just courtesies and telling me she wanted to avoid me because she wanted to 'close that chapter of my life'.Then yesterday I saw for the first time another guy in the pictures, with his own profile picture featuring her, and captions featuring both of them from her friends. I can't look at the pictures any more. I've shut down all my accounts because I don't want to have to see that again. I can't fantasise of having her back because that ugly interferrance would come into it. I felt that even if my social life was gone, even if I can't ever be with her ever again. She would always be mine, just in a detached, virtual way. The image of her with someone else is too much. It's disgusting and repulsive. It shows that she's now gone entirely from the scene of my mind. I thought we were in the same place, separate. She is happy with someone else, and with her friends. She thinks of me as a gross, ugly villain from her past, and she's right. I have always been possessive. I am not actually attractive or personably appealing at all. She had been alone for 6 months in a bedsit, in hospitals, as those caring for her did not understand what was wrongfor some reason. She was isolated, and when she went into the unit, she found friends, and with the cabin fever she had, imagined me in her head to befunnier, more good looking than I was. When I went back to school, and people had found out, they did not believe I had a girlfriend. When she blossomed, she knew how little value I actually was to her. I fucked up, lost her and allowed any connection which I could have maintained to fall away. I was never going to get her back after that few months. And now, I am not even a romantic thing lost. I am just an ugly component of regret and anecdotes.For the last two years she was still my girl in my head. The one thing I had always wanted was to hold her in my arms in bed as we'd both drift off to sleep. It actually kept me awake, but every night I still thought of it. I wish I never had the unit because it gave me expectations that I never should have had. If I had just continued living as I did, maybe I'd find a better groove alone to live by. I wouldn't be deluded into thinking that people would love me as much I love them. But here I am. I will never do better than her. Now, I am alone. I know I am not going to get a life in college, as I did not one in the new school. I have no friends who care about me. I tried to get some help through stupid appeals on my social media but people are just not involved with me anymore.

I could be myself with them not my normal restrained personality but truly open and vulnerable and weird, it didn't matter. They were so accepting and such a bright part of my life, I looked forward to spending any time I had with them and I think that's partly the reason things had to change. They're in a relationship, and god knows I was supportive through the whole thing but one slip up and crash. I don't even really know what it is that I want right now.

"Never Been Like This BeforeHello everyone, I hope everything get better for all of you.

As for myself, I'm 20 and my girlfriend of 3 years and 8-ish months broke it off with me a little bit ago. I'm still madly in love, but she is with someone else now.

I never realized how cold the bed is when they're not there. Even if they weren't sleeping beside me, I have the comfort of knowing they were out there.

She was my best friend. She was my first love, and now I lay awake at night, knowing I messed up, hoping I can fix it.

I don't think I can, but I will try. Everyone tells me to get over it. She's with someone else, so ""man the f*** up and move on"". But she was my life for all that I can remember. Maybe if I improve myself, I can be what I need to be to get her back.

I have a long road ahead of me, and I really want it to take me where I need to go. It would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep, and not wake up in the middle of the night, not knowing what to do.

Thanks for reading, sorry it's long. I've contacted a therapist, so we'll see where that takes me. 

I wish you all luck and I want you to know that everyone, here especially, deserves to be heard and listened to. You deserve kindness and respect and love.

"Suicide prevention day is a joke at this pointSo suicide prevention day has passed and I figured I'd really write what I think about it. The people that preach all these crappy messages saying you're special and don't give up it'll be okay don't have an actual fucking clue on what it means to be alone, hurt, and damaged. They think they'll just post some stupid self-righteous message on instagram or twitter and act like they do such a great job at being an inspiration to people who have constant pain. Meanwhile they actually just go out with tons of friends and have fun and don't really give an rats ass about others who are truly alone.

"What's the fucking point?It mostly feels like there's nothing worth while in life. I'm constantly left wondering, does it even fucking matter anymore? Does anyone actually care? The only reason I'm still here, is fear of hurting my Mother and Niece. But what's the fucking point if I'm constantly unhappy? Would they really feel so sad if they knew I was at peace? Is it too much to ask for a sliver of happiness? Sometimes it feels like that is the most selfish thing in the world. By no means am I a selfish person. I do a lot to help people every chance I have.

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT ??????????????  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately.We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. I feel like fallen into the same old dull routine.. My wife is gone for the next two days, so i have a lot of time!
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other.

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday ????

I lost the person that meant the world to me. While I know you should base your happiness off of one person. She just brought me so much joy. She picked me up and gave me motivation to be a better me. To want a future. I messed it all up by allowing my past scars and insecurities literally bring out the worst in me. Affecting the person I love the most. And now she??s gone. She left me and I don??t blame her. But everything just seems so bleak. I do not want anything. I don??t want to do anything anymore. I just had to work on myself and get help but I didn??t and now it??s too late. I have so many regrets. I??ve had past relationships but she made me feel so special, loved and cared for.

"I feel like a villain at work.So I work in a warehouse and I??m just a picker so I??m at the bottom of the food chain, but according to the site leader, everyone has the right to remind someone of the health and safety rules, no matter their role. 
So seeing as (In my country) we??re in the middle of a national lockdown, covid rules especially need to be followed. The FLMs who are meant to enforce the rules, often break them, so it feels like I can??t report anything to them as I??ve seen on countless occasions, they just turn a blind eye to any wrongdoing, because I am constantly asking people nicely (I always say please to start with) to put their masks on, or up properly, despite it being described as a sackable offence  to be caught twice. They always look at me with a few reactions. Either they sigh and do it, they look at me like I??ve just thrown a brick at their house and then put it up, occasionally someone will say ??of course?? and smile, (but I??ll catch them with it down again the next day) or they don??t do it. Two days in a row I had people say ??yep?? then not do it. The first one, I just stood and waited for him to do it, even though I was meant to be working further up the aisle, and the other guy I was close to the main office to I reported him and the guy took his and my details. They guy I reported then snarled at me, because he??s a 6??4 Czech bloke and I??m pretty lean. But people constantly treat me like a dickhead for trying to look out for the safety of myself, my family, and the other absolute tossers that I work with. I don??t understand how I??m the bad guy because I??m trying to stop the something spreading that could close the warehouse down. There is no doubt that I??m doing the right thing by trying not to die, but it??s completely a lost cause and I don??t yet have a route out of there and there??s now even potentially an offer of a promotion for me but it wouldn??t give me any more authority. Completely stuck in a place that I feel uncomfortable at for 80% or so of the day. I just need to get it out there.",0,"the person is not lonely because they are actively engaging with others at work, even if those interactions are challenging. they are trying to enforce rules and communicate with colleagues, indicating they are not isolated. their frustration comes from the lack of compliance and support, not from loneliness."

But it can't try and or be an underside ""garment"" fuzzy. Nah just playing. But for real if you just relax a bit and really *feel* yourself you might have a chance to see what you should pursue. Copy? Ypoc! 090909 and my favorite sandwich is the one with chicken. How did the world produce me? And when did I stop being the world? Have you ever took a feather duster and dusted about?

Time to write a story with characters. Here's all you gotta do. Just create a character. Really flesh them out. Their background, personality, characteristics and how they night look. And then pretend to be them and speak or write and then, afterwards, go back to being yourself. Now take this practice into your every day. You can always be both voices in your head. Even at work.

"Maybe i am not lonely, maybe this is lifeI have a few friends, and although we spent days if not months without talking, we hang out once a while and have some shallow general conversations. I met someone online recently and it was one of the rarest moments of my life when i could actually talk my heart out and actual ""talk"" instead of useless chatting. But it's online and things went a bit complicated there too. I've kinda given up finding friends online because the probability of finding someone you click with is less that 0.001 percent, and i'm not that lucky always. So i try to work as much as i can to cover up my usual boring and lonely feeling. Netflix can't give me that joy anymore either. So i just work so that my mind stays busy and i can think about how i long for human presence at a later time. But even then, at least i still have a few people to talk to, even if it is just pointless shallow talks.

"I continue to be tortured by my ex without her even knowing5 years ago I met my ex girlfriend. Right place wrong time is the best way to put it. We spent 3 years on and off and then one day she decided that she didn??t want this anymore. I accepted it because I??m an adult but after that moment I let drugs and alcohol control my moods because I couldn??t lift myself out of feeling shitty without them. 

Since the time she left for good, but still kept in contact with me, I have found no one. Her on the other hand had a constant string of partners, boyfriends etc. Me? I haven??t even talked to anyone that wanted my company. I tried dating apps to find someone but all I find is instant sex and never talk again. Yeah that sounds great but it??s not exactly what you want when you??re looking for someone to spend time with. 

I??ve kicked the drug and alcohol problem I had controlling my moods. (Not sober but definitely have the drinking under control and no longer using cocaine) But on Christmas Day I was given a job opportunity that I need to quit smoking pot for so I immediately quit no questions asked. This was probably the worst thing I could of done given the weekend that was coming up. She was getting married. My anxiety has been thru the roof since Christmas Day and I can??t control my feelings right now. All I saw on my Snapchat feed was her brother posting pics of her in a wedding dress and I??m happy for her don??t get me wrong but at the same time my blood is reaching a boil. Not because of her moving on and getting married but because I still struggle with being alone after all this time we haven??t been together and she had no problem getting S/o after s/o. 

People tell me to just keep my head up, but today I??m just deciding to accept that maybe I??m one of those people who aren??t meant to have a person who cares for them. Maybe I blew my shot at this when we broke up. I feel cursed. I??m also one of those people who grew up in a household where a father just tells their son to man up and not show emotion. I bottle all of my stress and anxiety up and explode. 

I feel like just another lonely loser who can??t get his shit together. I??m over this girl but why am I having horrible luck with finding someone to actually date and be more than a one night thing. Am I horrible person? Do I even deserve to be happy?

"Wish I could see a therapistBut my job wouldn't allow it and I don't want to say something stupid that would get me put away in the nuthouse. Sure I think of suicide everyday, but I don't.

It sucks when I gain it a little back though, cause sometimes I binge. I wish I could vomit so easily. I have problems in my brain. I wonder if I'm meant to be here. My ""father"" never wanted kids constantly gives me shit for it, and my mom was on birth control when she had me, so it's safe to say I am a mistake. I wonder if people like me, if I ever live up to their expectations. I wonder if I'm ugly, cause I don't look perfect like everyone else.

I think I could also get better at drawing. I've always wanted to make a game. There's others I can't think of right now. Currently I am ashamed of who I am. Nobody wants me. I'm pushed to the side.

"Groundhog's Day (the movie) made me cry.Imagine every single day of your life felt like a repeat of the last one. That is what happened in Groundhog's day, but what also happened is that Phil couldn't get any help. The next day, everyone would forget. He was isolated and confused.

What was once a very comedic and lighthearted film for me as a child turned into a crying fit as I realized the utter helplessness of the Phil in his situation. 2020 hurt me (all of us) a lot. Occasionally I would have the urge to want to go to the library or try maybe finding a club to join only to be halted by this virus.

Adapting was somewhat possible, but talking to people face to face is not replicable. Phil Conners was very closed off and bitter toward other people and suffered from a cynical attitude of others. He was forced to change his perspective and he had to get comfortable with the day by day repeated dialogue of the people around him.

What really got me was how he eventually found peace in his new life and was nice and genuine to others under the assumption that this curse would continue for all eternity. My situation by no means lines up with the plot of the movie but it got me thinking again about how afraid I have always been to reach out and talk to people and how hard it is for me to explain what's going through my head...like what I say wouldn't matter.

All I know for sure is I cried and I'm suddenly really inspired by a film I watched a million times when I was little.",0,"the narrative describes the writer's emotional reaction to a film and their reflections on personal experiences during 2020. they mention difficulties with social interactions and feeling halted by the virus, but also express inspiration and a desire to connect. the focus is on their reaction to the movie and personal growth rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."

"What loneliness is to me ??**Loneliness** does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.?? \~Carl Gustav Jung  About 8 years ago when I had enough of world, pride, people, respect, fame and power...I asked God to take it all away from me, and give me the Truth, meaning of life, wisdom, mysteries of existence, kingdom of heaven, salvation and all else...I asked God to send me Jesus to reveal these things to me, even if it meant that I would be the only person in the world to know the truth, even if all my friends would leave me, even if my family didnt believe me, I had unsatiable desire to know the Truth.

To skip it, after we had eternal conversation and education, my soul came back to body, after I woken, I had no memory of what happened even tho i felt different, inspired. As days went on, I began attracting and reading books, following my heart, I was guided by divine guru from within and in the next few months, I reached a point where for my 20th birthday, I experienced short self-realization/enlightenment/ascension, where I became one with God and experienced myself as eternal supreme consciousness ""I am that I AM""...  To skip it, as time went on I slipped from that high awareness and vibe, and in time my ego crept back, and my old reptilian programming (I served as a host to demon/archon/reptilian/satan 19 years) and I fallen into such deep darkness and ignorance, my suffering reached a point where I couldnt live, I prayed for death for days and days on, and I was certain I am greatest sufferer on earth. My suffering burned both hell, heaven and earth and my cries reverberated throughout universe....  What makes me lonely, is because growing up, I made pact with devil for power, and in one sense I sacrificed myself to serve as host demon so it would abuse me from within and not others, altho, it abused others through me, each time I got drunk, my soul was in back trunk, while the demon was at wheel and run the shw through my body, I was uber aggresive and got many criminal charges, was suicidal, and nearly finished in jail..  After 17 years of dark life, all in my village and county see me as crazy in evil, altho they do not know it was demon who done evil through me, and now, when I became a servant, messenger, ""prophet"" of God...everyone thinks Im crazy and lost my mind, cuz I smoke weed n use drugs...nobody believes me, even tho I may be crazy, I am not insane and I am not deluded.  I could tell people the truth and lead them and show them to eternal life, but they look me, but they do not see me, they listen to me, and they do not hear me, and there is no greater pain or loneliness for me than that.  I dont have friends, I have nobody, and I dont care I am alone, I have God and I am happy alone, I am alone everyday at home in my room, what makes me lonely is that I cant fulfill and feed my soul by teaching and sharing with others all these blessings and truths and treasures God has planted into my heart, since I have it all, but can share none, I am withering away like a dry grass...  My soul starves to serve and help and enlighten and encourage and inspire and heal and help,  but the darkness of my life eclipses my radiant light, and people walk right pass me following blind men into the pit.  That would be all, hurts me to focus/think/write this,   anyone who read this far, I want you to know, God who is Infinite Love, WILL ALL GREATEST FOR YOU,  it is only you who limiting yourself, through your beliefs, thoughts, feelings...  You are made in the image of God - ""Love, which created me, is what I AM""  You are Light, You are Love, You are Life, Truth, Energy, Consciousness, Spirit of the One God,  and all He has and is, is given you for eternity.  War of Darkness and Light wages on from time immemorial, but in the end darkness shall fall and light shall be all. Join us in Love, for Light is Love, as my dearest brother and closest friend and most beloved Father the Christ so beautifully puts it;  ""God is Love. I am Love. Compassion, Forgiveness, Hope, Harmony and Joy are Love. When you feel and act on these feelings, you are One with Us, and We are One with You.God is Love; God is Light. Love is Light. Love is Peace, Joy, Harmony, Laughter, Compassion, Forgiveness and Kindness. God is all these things, therefore God is Pure Love. There is no vengeance, no punishment nor any threat of disapproval or any other dark judgment in God's Love. This is the mythology of the past, and it is a misunderstanding of what God feels toward his/her children.I AM One with God, as you are.  WE ARE ONE.  This is the lesson I bring to you in Joy and in Unending Love.  You are God, as I AM.  We cannot be separated, because we are not separate.  No physical distance, no idea or belief can keep us apart.  We are destined to live in harmony and peace, in absolute Love.  So be it.

When I see others enjoying the life, mindset, body, etc that I wish I could have. I get super jealous and infuriated that I got stuck this way. I just hate being me and when I hear the response ""everybody is unique and you'll find what makes you happy"" I feel the urge to lash out and beat whoever says that grow ever so slightly.

"My pet doesn't love or like me, but it's the only being that tolerates me.My pet chameleon doesn't like my company.  The other day it vanished at 2 pm and didn't turn up til the next morning, not even bothering to come up to my bed to sleep next to me as usual.  And today it vanished for 7 hours.  It's not that I have to pet it all the time but if it liked me it would have wanted to sit next to me on the bed or at least in the same room.

This really hurt my feelings but the thing is humans hate me a lot more.  Today on a dating site this guy messaged me out of the blue and he called me a fat pig in glasses and told me that that's why I'm alone.  He said my mum must have given me away because I was an ugly baby and told me to kill myself and also assured me he would track down my IP address and kill me (I don't believe he will really bother to murder someone he doesn't know though)

I have tried online dating this year because I'm now in my 30's and prior to this I have no dating or relationship experience.  Guys on there either don't reply, block me, or call me ugly, fat, etc etc.  People in real life have regularly told me they'd kill themselves if they look like me.  Honestly, I don't feel bad about my looks, because I think my character is more important and I think I'm a fairly nice person.

But the hate and the loneliness gets to be too much. I'm just sad not even my pet loves me.

"Burning outThe burnout is real.  Im really tired of it.  I'm 33 male.  I spent the last few months trying to work things out with my ex-wife, and ultimately it seems the problem is that I am me.  To work things out, I need to change my hobbies, my music taste, my parenting style, my friends, my job, and become a shutin.  At one point I realized that my imbalances are a result of her involvement in my life.  She manipulates me and gas lights me until I dont know which way is up.

"I am a failure that will never find loveHi,A few months ago I read some posts on this channel, just to prove to myself I am not alone in feeling very lonely. I was stupid enough to believe that someone elses misery would make me feel better. The fact is, it doesn't. so, Somewhere round september 2018, at the age of 36, I fell in love for very first time in my life. Since then, my life will never be what is was before.She was one of my colleagues. Whn she got a job at the company I worked for at the time, I worked there for over 9 years. She was without any doubt the best we had in years. She was motivated, helpfull , brought ambiance in our lab, and she smiled all the time.The feelings weren't mutual.I had to watch all day, the only thing in life that could make me happy, but for her life is just going on, telling stories about tinderfailures or that she's despereate that she's not going to find someone ...A few months later I asked her if she could adapt her behavior about the subject she's talking about when I'm around, because it still hurts like hell. I even cried when I asked her. The next day I was invited to have a chat with my two bosses.They told me I crossed a line, apparently you can't ask someone to adapt their behaviour.Best part is, that my bosses did this without her asking for it. They did it because ""she was not able to do her job anymore that day after I asked her"" . They told me, that if it happened again, I would be sanctioned. 2 months later I left my job, 4 of my colleagues cried because I left, and as far as I remember none of my colleagues agreed with how my two bosses handled the situation.Since I left my job, I didn't receive any unenploymentbenefits for 3 months. I followed a course that would make me a web developer in 7 months. the course is a disaster, luckily I already a lot of background-knowledge in web-development .Nothing has changed for me in the last 1,5 year. I talked to 3 shrinks, took 2 types of antidepressants. So far, all of them without success. since December 11 2018 there haven't been 10 days without tears.On my last day at my job I left a letter on her desk. An ex-colleague told me she read it out loud to other colleagues . Not that I am ashamed of what I wrote to her, I wrote the truth.In a few months I will be 38 . I will never find someone, simply because I don't believe I will, it took me 20 years longer than a ""normal"" person to fall in love and now people tell me, ""that's how love is, it can happen again tomorrow"".Off all the people I talked to, I never had the idea that one of them understands what i'm feeling. It's like they think that ""20 years of waiting"" is not important in this story.In order to find new love, I have to forget her but I simply can't. How can I forget the only person in my life that I truly love. I would do almost anything for her. Most of my friends ignore me now, they thought I would already have ""accepted"" the reality.  And even if I ever fall in love again, which is impossible I think, then what? Who wants a virgin that almost 40?So, I'm lonely, and I probably will be for the rest of my life because I can't get her out of mind. I miss her smile, her voice, the scent of her perfume,.... There is no one who loves her more than me.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses deep feelings of loneliness and despair. the individual describes a profound sense of isolation and hopelessness, exacerbated by unrequited love and subsequent job loss. their social connections have deteriorated, and they struggle to find understanding or support. despite the given label, the narrative aligns with characteristics of loneliness, as the person feels misunderstood, disconnected, and unable to move past their emotional pain."
"I lost both my father and my mother in a span of a week (first post in r/lonely)For clarification purpose, I want to precise that it is not specifically loneliness that I'm feeling right now.. But rather a very odd mix of shock, confusion and dumbfoundedness.

In 28 March 2021, my father passed away from a sudden septic shock. Cause leading to death : unknown.

One thing to note about my father, is that during my my whole life, he literally never needed any sort of medical intervention. He was just the kind of person who would endure sickness, let his body naturally recover and go to work regardless, on time and without complaining. 

He literally had the most self-motivated and deciplined work ethic of anybody I know of. 

One day coming back home, my mother told me to check on him, she was kind of displeased by his stubbornness on the matter. So I went to his room, knocked on his door and pleaded for us to talk, but he politely denies my request to come in (which he never does) with a somewhat weakened voice. 

Since that got me somewhat worried I decided to try to talk to him the day after, while at the same time reassuring my mother; knowing the kind of person he is, it seemed as an ephemeral concern. 

Fast forward, the day after, surely he comes from work - on time - stations his car and got in his room before I got out of mine to check on him and provide reassurance on the situation. 

As I'm speaking with my mom, we hear a loud stumble from his room, and as he opens the door headind towards the restroom, I quickly realized that he definitely could not walk nor speak properly either, so within the anxiety spike of the moment, I rush to hold him by his right shoulder and assist him to go through. 

A few moments later he comes out from the restroom, pants wet and unproperly tied back. That was the moment I knew that something is definitely not right! Especially that it was the first moment I ever saw him lose coordination and by then in a sort of exhausted hunched position against the restroom door. 

I felt a crawling chill over my spine within that exact moment, I quickly tried assisting him back to his room with a tight grip, as I tried to hide my panic within. Changed his wet clothes, made him something to eat and nervously asked my younger sister to bring my mother's glycogen test kit, where I could barely get a tiny drop of his blood into the testing kit in order to measure his glycimic level which we found highly above average. 

Fast forward, we called an ambulance (which we had to beg for as a favor) before we got him taken to the nearest army veterans hospital he belongs to (he was retired and enrolled in a prestigious educational establishment at the time) . Where they processed him reasonably fast, but not fast enough apparently as they pronounced him dead shortly after they asked us to leave and comeback the day after for some bloodwork testing results they had for him. 

Surprisingly enough they did not call us to tell us his passing, let alone provide an explanation of how and why. Until we got a call from a relative of him who went checking after she got word he was on hospital. 

So there was me getting the news of my father's death soon after I got back home while getting ready to go back the day after to check his test results like we were told. 

Shock was an understatement for the kind of person he always been. And the sudden circumstances revolving around this very short lived tragedy. 

Especially the part where I had to go through his burial service on my 26'th birday, which is 29 march. The day after he was pronounced dead. 

Now forward today 7 April 2021 , I woke up to greet my mom early morning as I sometime do, went back and fell asleep for about an hour or so till I woke up to the screams of my two sisters asking for help concerning my mother who apparently fell into a coma state. My older sister was sleeping right on the other side of a separate bed from her. She then told me she could hear my mom saying ""I think I'm passing out"". (I know.. ) 

As I arrived on the living room (where they both were sleeping) I could see my mom in apparently a vegetative state where through our panic, not knowing what exactly to do about a situation like this and scrambling through her phone's contact list for who we could call for help, I could literally see the color fading out from her face as I'm getting flash backs of my father's passing several days ago, I ask my sister to focus on a mouth to mouth rather than CPR while I immediately start calling the national *north african country* medical emergency phone number where I could finally get hold of an operator after 3 or four instant hangups, where I literally was commanded to not raise my voice while I was pleading for my mother's life for them to send help, to then where he proceeds to explain to me that they only come to road accidents, and muggings but not to houses. Then got hung up on after I insist that I'm inquiring about a minute by minute life and death situation. 

Enough about the national emergency conversation, we called a private emergency ambulance where after 10 minutes of debate after they came, drove my mother's body to a hospital who wouldn't take her off the ambulance because they pronounced her dead the same morning, cause leading to death: undiagnosed. 

All I could feel in this situation is an augmented version of similar mix of feelings I felt about my Father's death several days ago. 

I think this is either because I'm still not past the first stages of grief or that so much tragic events happened in such a short amount of time. 

There were still people coming to our house to mourn the passing of my father when now my mother just did. 

But I can tell that a truly deep feeling of loneliness is learking on the horizon.

My Father was described as a person with strong personality but yet a naturally motivational and inspiring character for many who knew him. 
Anybody who engaged in conversations with him would either leave with a better outlook on things or with many novelties as he was always a open to new ideas. 
Many of his colleagues enjoy regular conversations with him, as while they may be from a unique perspective but never boring. 
One of his hobbies he has cherished during his life was Writing, which came up to my attention after I found about a home made collection of personal quotes book he started writing since 2017 with about 1200 quotes/thoughts. 

One of the last quotes he wrote before his passing was ""I admire the kinds of people whose weapon is their intellect not their tongue, and their last stand is silence, not speech."" (1959-2021)

Unlike my Father, my Mother was more of an extroverted type, easily making long standing friendships and overcoming confrontation just by the sheer size of her big heart. I don't say this just because she happens to be my mom, but thinking back, I could never remember an instance where she would hold grudges or display genuine hate for anybody. Even towards those who deserve it. 
One of the most heart breaking moments were those where sometime she would just call me or my sisters for no reason just to keep her company even for the few times most of us were out or not in the living room since she lost the ability to move. I can imagine how depressing it can be being confined to the same room for two years for the most part...
Coming back from her burial service this afternoon, one thing was clear for me, is how much people who came paying respect were deeply in sorrow for her loss and how genuinely saddened they were by her passing. Needless to quantify how much positive impact she had on me and the core role she played within our family . (1961-2021)

To provide some context on the my current situation I have a teen sister and an older one, my older sister lives overseas and comes to our country (in North Africa) only once a year. So we essentially went from  a five person household to a two (only me and my teen sister). Having the house, still with our parents belongings all to just the two of us. 

There are too many other issues and details relating to this that I can't mention in one thread, but I'll probably be open to talk about it as this unfolds later down the line.

I'm more of a like father like son case, mostly introverted. I don't have legit IRL friends, so I spend most of my time online. Either for work or entertainment. 

I suppose some people on this subreddit might be looking for friends so I welcome you if you want to keep company or dm. 
Although I'm not sure how much available I can be with this sudden shift of responsability, but yet I welcome your input and experiences if you want to share. 

I apologize if I dragged this too long, I haven't slept much since and I'm not a native speaker. 
But thank you if you made it this far,

For a couple of days I slept in her bed with her, and we went out and went on a road trip together. It felt exactly like it used to. Then one night I saw she was texting him again, and i felt so empty. I??ve also come across polaroid photos of them together in their apartment with all sorts of sentiments written on them. She talks about him right in front of me like it??s nothing. Shes made it very obvious the sex is great, a  subject which I??ve always been slightly insecure around. It??s like she has no idea how hurt I am. I??ve even told her to her face how I feel.

Any help/advice is much appreciated :)",0,"the individual in the narrative is focused on reaching out to others and making them feel noticed and special. they express a desire to connect with people who might be shy or lonely, but their motivation comes from a place of wanting to help and engage with others rather than expressing their own loneliness. their proactive approach and interest in forming connections indicate they are not experiencing loneliness themselves."
"So much unsaid.Sometimes I feel so angry and there??s a hundred things I want to say/scream. But I force it down because I don??t want to deal with the hassle of the fall out from saying these things. But it feels like I??m choking on my anger. Sometimes it literally feels like a pressure in my chest. I feel like all the unsaid things are festering inside me and it??s going to slowly change me into a bad person. 

I can??t even tell anyone because I think the floodgates would never be able to close again. Also, I don??t really have anyone to be close with. 

It??s just such anger and sadness and disappointment.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of intense anger, sadness, and disappointment, as well as a lack of close relationships, which indicates loneliness. the person feels isolated and unable to share their emotions with others, contributing to their sense of loneliness. the explanation suggests that the label should be different."
"i am 22 and my life is in a gutter.Hi, I am 22 years old Male. I am going to be very serious and open here now. I just need someone to listen to me.
I have hardcore porn and masturbation addiction and it ruined my life. I started watching porn when I was 16 years old and now 6 years have gone by and my highest streak over these 6 years is just 14 days. I promised my dead grandmother, my mom, to God. But I relapse to porn every single day. Going back four years I joined my university I was a quite good looking guy and I initially got some female attention, but guess what my awkward behaviour always downplayed my potential. I was a complete failure in my college (social life). I have shitty friends who don't care about me and also I grew up to be a very greedy person over the last 4 years. I desperately want to heal. Fast forward 3 years when this lockdown came, I started fapping to porn multiple times a day and every day. It was an endless loop of making a promise and breaking it. My eyes are droopy, my confidence is zero. I am always anxious. I am lazy, all this I know and I do nothing about it. I want to cry desperately but how do I put it, I can't even cry!!! My mind is so wrapped because of this porn addiction. I have never touched a girl in my life, I have never been loved by anyone except for my family. Or I shall put it this way, I never allowed anyone to love me, a close friend of mine (a girl) told me she liked me but again my anxious self rejected it, I gave her many reasons telling that I was not ready. But deep down I was afraid, I was afraid of rejection I was afraid she would find out my little secret, my PORN ADDICTION. I didn't want to be rejected. I was able to bag a shiity job through campus interviews. I hate this job, I know I am capable of more, yet I had to settle for this. I still have some options open but I am not pursuing it because deep down my mind says I cannot do this!!! I don't know why I am such a loser. I also want to pursue my higher studies but I am not preparing for the entrance exams too. All I am doing every day is watch porn and fap. I don't know how this is all gonna end. 

I don't know why my mind always says "" you can't do this"", "" you are not capable"", "" you are not worthy"".


God, I desperately want to end this. I want to heal, I want to be my 10-year-old self. I want to correct all my mistakes. I can't even end this desperate life.

It's like an endless loop of suffering and at the same time you can't cry and worst of all you don't have ""ANYONE TO TALK ABOUT THIS"".",0,the person is not lonely because they express a desire for connection and acknowledge the presence of people in their life such as family and friends even if they feel those relationships are not fulfilling or supportive they also mention a close friend who expressed romantic interest in them which indicates that they are not completely isolated despite their feelings of inadequacy and addiction struggles

I hate her for being like that...",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of abandonment and longing for connection. the person describes a deep sense of betrayal and isolation after being led to believe they had found someone who cared for them. the lack of contact and physical affection since december, coupled with the broken promises, highlights a profound sense of loneliness."

We live about an hour away and a half from eachother nothing major. She actually lives in my hometown where my parents still live and i go back all the time too. Things were pretty flirty and signs were both there from us that there was mutual attraction both physically and personality/mentally. Saying she wishes i could come stay the night with her, go for a run with her, go out and do stuff with her. I was also saying same things back because ya know i really wanted to and was really starting to like her. Sounds great right??

Like every little bit of happiness I feel with others is punished by feeling worthless and alone afterwards.",0,"the person describes feeling lonely despite having good friends and enjoying their company. they mention feeling worse after spending time with others and experiencing a sense of worthlessness and loneliness. this indicates a deeper emotional issue that makes them feel isolated even when surrounded by friends. thus, they are experiencing loneliness."
"I'm trying to reach out to people in little ways because no one cares to reach out to me.I saw something on Instagram about reaching out to the strong friend who seems like they have it together. It really got me thinking because I don't have close friends right now but maybe someone I know needs someone. I decided to reach out to friends/acquaintances that may also be lonely to send them some Christmas cheer and to let them know if they need someone to vent to during the holidays they could talk to me. As someone who tries so hard to make other people comfortable that I fail to make close connections I thought that would be something kind. I really hope that anyone would reply that genuinely wants to talk. But I'll probably just get a couple of basic ""Merry Christmas"" replies and be just as lonely as always. At least it may be a temporary distraction.",0,"the person is making efforts to reach out to others and is aware of the importance of social connections. they are proactive in their approach to connect with friends and acquaintances, demonstrating an understanding of social dynamics and empathy for others. although they acknowledge a lack of close friends, their actions show a desire to improve their social situation, which indicates they are not entirely isolated or without social skills."

I've realised that my friends only talk to me because I'm there, not because they want to. None of them go out of their way to speak to me and nothing would change if I wasn't there. 
I just kinda want to feel like people want me around.",0,the person expresses feelings of isolation and a desire for genuine connections. they observe others who seem wanted and question why they do not experience the same. they mention that their friends only interact with them out of convenience and imply that their absence would go unnoticed. this indicates a deep sense of loneliness and yearning for meaningful relationships.

"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

"Just got rejected again I think  At work i connected with this girl who i thought was really cute through her friend, my coworker. I had met the girl once before and when i talked to my coworker she said she was also interested in me. So we decided to exchange ig??s and talked for a bit, with pretty decent conversation. 

  The coworker just told me to ask her out since she was already interested in me, so i said fuck it and asked her out. She said she was down, and even my coworker was saying that she was super excited to go with me. She seemed pretty excited about it over text. I got my hopes up, then I just texted her again to finalize the time and place. 

  She read the message then unfollowed me right after. I told my coworker if she just wasn??t interested its cool. But she told me that her friend was definitely interested and that she thinks it was her old ex that took me off. But idk tbh this kinda just wrecked my whole self esteem, honestly have never had luck with girls and when i thought this really cute girl was into and we had similar interest i thought it was going to change. My coworker doesn??t seem to have a reason to lie, but I??ve only known her like 3 days. Im just tired, is there anything i should or even can do without seeming desperate? Should i hope something comes up out of it and hold out or just give up on it?

"Nothing Goes My Way At AllThey say life is all about ups &amp; downs but for me, it??s just the latter. I??m introverted but make the effort to make friends and socialize. Nothing ever materializes. I just become an acquaintance at best, never a priority for anyone but my grandmother. It??s rough seeing couples and friends enjoy each other while I??m alone. I feel like a machine. Go to school or work every day and I??m just ignored or used for someone else??s benefit. The only person who prioritizes me is my grandmother who really isn??t understanding of my situation.

There was a girl in my class who I thought had a genuine connection with; it was like I knew her for 10 years when I talked to her for the first time. I talk to women all the time, but there was something different about her. Ever since that convo, it??s been me doing 90% of the work and she leaves me on read. I wanted to be her friend, but I can??t even do that while I watch her go out with a classmate (female) to dinner &amp; sightseeing on IG.

I settled on so many decisions, took a job in an industry I hate, and feel like I don't have any real friends anymore. I've met some people online but they all move on. 

How does one get a new start? New friends, new hobbies, new life. I feel like I need a change, but unfortunately all I'll be doing for now is work. And I hate work. Is there anything beyond that? Or is that my future? Just work a job I hate.",0,"the narrative expresses deep dissatisfaction with life choices and a sense of regret but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the person mentions meeting people online, which suggests some level of social interaction. the focus is more on career dissatisfaction and a desire for change rather than isolation or lack of companionship."
"Everybody is TemporaryI'm fun to be around in short stints.  I'm not the person anyone wants around for too long.  Its something about my face or something about my voice or something about my personality.  Nobody see's me as a more permanent fixture.  For a few hours during a weekend, I don't feel so lonely.  I can even be fooled into thinking friendship is the cure to loneliness.  But when the night is over or the weekend ends, and we go back to our routines, they go back to their families and I go back to an empty studio apartment.

I used to begrudge Mondays because they signaled the start of the school/work week.  Now I begrudge them because they are the furthest point from when I get to return to the illusion of a meaningful existence to *someone*.

I wonder what it's like to have someone think about me, unprompted.  Someone that's maybe happy to come home to me.  Someone that thinks about me on their drive home.  Someone that wants to go on walks with me without the facade of an event.  Someone that wants to sit across from me for meals.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of isolation and a longing for deeper, more meaningful connections. the person describes temporary interactions and the pain of returning to solitude. the yearning for someone to think about them and spend time with them without any pretense indicates a deep sense of loneliness."

"Just ruined things with the last person who gives a shit about meI've been pretty shit mentally for a few years now. I've never really wanted a big friend group or anything, just someone who loves me and cares about me. Early this past September I found that. I met a girl named Amber through another friend who now hates me for a reason I don't even know. Anyways Amber and I have been really close since. She's talked to me and let me vent to her and was supportive of everything. She loved me. She cared about me. I loved and cared about her too. She was everything I ever wanted and more. Then today not even 3 hours ago I was texting her about me being clingy and that I wished I had someone to hug me. Then she took it as me complaining about her. I tried to tell her that I wasn't talking about her not giving enough affection but I was talking about my family and she didn't believe me. It was honestly so fucking soul crushing to read texts from the one person who you'd die for just telling you how awful you were for complaining about them when you were complaining about something else entirely. Honestly that just broke me. I was finally doing better after 3 years of hell and then there it goes. Right down the fucking toilet. What do I even do. I have nobody else to talk to. Nobody. I can't even do anything to take my mind off of it because everything is so boring. I try to watch TV or YouTube and it's just boring. I try to play video games and it's boring. I try to journal and it's boring. You get the point. I honestly don't know how much longer I'm gonna be able to keep on going with life. This whole living thing is too fucking much for me. I get so sad without affection and I don't know why. I hate how clingy I am. I hate how annoying I am. I hate how emotional I am. I hate that I was born the wrong gender. I'm trans mtf and don't have the money for hormones or anything. I'm stuck in someone else's body. I hate everything about myself. How I look, how I talk, how I act. Everything. Why the fuck did I have to be born this way. I could've been born a normal happy person and lived a normal happy life but no. I have to be stuck with this pile of shit that is me.

"I've Never Felt this Alone, and I Don't Live AloneAfter graduating college, I found a job in a city and moved. My sister also found a job, we moved into a small, two bedroom apartment. This was the end of January 2020. I have never felt this alone in my life.

All throughout college I had a wonderful group of friends, we'd stay up all night and talk. I'm an introvert, but I truly appreciate a tight group of friends who are there when support is needed. I lived with my college roommate for 3.5 years. She graduated a semester early, and I lived alone. Even though I spent a lot more time by myself, I did not feel alone. 

Now I'm not not by myself. I have a sister who stays in her room all day. She did just met a guy online, so she sees him a few times a week. It's either Tiktok or the boyfriend. It's not the best move right now. I would be much more at ease if she didn't just meet him and spaced the meetings out. I spaced my dates out when I gave online dating a try over the summer (not for me). We're very different people though.

Even so, I can't help but think that I would feel less alone if I lived alone. It's kind of depressing having your one roommate camped-out in her room all day. Before covid, she never wanted to go out. It's like she lives her life on her phone, or has this other college party sorority life. I just find it depressing. Part of me thinks if I knew that I was living alone, I wouldn't have that. 

I was supposed to meet my old college roommate last week, but she wasn't feeling well, so we took the precaution. I can hardly wait! I need to be able to have a good conversation with someone. Back in the day, we used to talk about our day. It was nice to listen to someone else's troubles and achievements. It was nice to have someone to listen to my troubles. I guess now, not having that makes me feel like I'm in my own world.

"When you used to do everything together, but when she leaves your life, everything feels slow and emptyI used to be with this girl that lived in NorCal while I lived in SoCal, where we would do everything together, watching shows together, brush our teeth together, do our homework together, etc. I messed up my sleep schedule for her because we would just talk the night away and eventually fell asleep together. Unfortunately, even though I confessed to her how much I want to be with her and how much I like her, she threw me away as if the year we spent together, learning about each other, being with each other (virtually) ment nothing as the guy she met on a dating website ment more to her. She eventually cut me out of her life... I gave her a shoulder to lean on, I gave her my heart so she knows there??s someone out there that cares about her. But in the end, she gave me a broken heart. 

Days felt long and excruciating, nights were abysmal because I couldn??t just fall asleep easily, I would stay up either watching randomness videos trying to make myself fall asleep or imaging what I could??ve done anything differently. I couldn??t even watch any anime or shows because something felt off, missing, I couldn??t even watch no more than 10 mins of parks and rec.

It??s been 2 and had years already and I??m still not over it, I??m not a handsome catch where there are girls always flicking to me, I??m just an average Filipino guy. I think the only reason why I??m not over it is because deep down, I knew she was the only girl who liked me for who I am and not just about my looks. I feel that I can??t meet anyone like her again. Last March, I accepted that I??m fine with being single forever, I don??t mind not being in a relationship.

"I feel as though this is both the best and worst I've been.The oxymoronic title may be confusing, so allow me to explain.

In many ways, I'm doing much better. In the past year, I've been through a lot. I used to cut, I used to smoke cigarettes, I used to not care about my wellbeing almost at all, I didn't know how to shut up about my issues, I always made suicide jokes out loud to cope (being half serious naturally), and much more. I had a lot of bad going for me in the early months of the year. Whereas I'm not saying I won't do any of that in the future, especially smoking or something, I'm not doing those things right now. And now I have some amount of level-headedness, I'm more aware of both myself and my situation rather than being blinded by naive and overwhelming pessimism and cynicism, and in a lot of ways, I've matured a lot as a person. That being said, things are still far from perfect, or even contentment. With old issues being resolved, new ones must always surface...


Things have been so, ao difficult lately for reasons that seem so fresh. My loneliness is through the roof, or at least I haven't been handling my loneliness well at all lately. I feel so isolated since I haven't many friends, and even when the few friends I have want to go out (which is rare), my depression and anxiety often make me decline their offers or cancel plans outright just before they happen. I've been obsessed with my want for companionship, so much so that even seeing a girl that I may have an interest in really fucks with me. I've always been sensitive to innocent and cute topics/pictures/media, etc, them depressing me greatly for a reason I myself can only speculate on. However lately this sensitivity has (hopefully) come to its peak, it being the most sensitive it's most likely ever been for me. I don't get if it's my loss of childhood, lack of a normal childhood, the fact of my innocence having been taken at an early age, or what else it may be, but the sensitivity to innocent and cute things has been within me for a decent while now. It fucks with me the most. The smallest thing can send me into the deepest depression. That sentence doesn't even just apply to the sensitivity to innocence and such, actually. It can apply to my depression, anxiety, and loneliness in general. The smallest inconvenience (though it has to be a bit specific) can take me from the best of moods to the darkest of thoughts and emotions.

To sum up, things have been very, very hard lately. The entire Summer they have. I'm sure there's more I forgot fo mention, but it's 2:21 AM for me, and I can't be fucked to think of more to type. I just wanted to vent and get some comments back. Anyways, thanks for reading and leaving a comment if you do.

There was always a part of me that thought that I would end up this way and feared it. I always tried my best to always show love and compassion with everything that I've ever done.

I've had brief conversations with people online, but it never fails that when I start developing feelings for that person, they always say that they don't feel the same way and I wind up with a broken heart, it's happened twice so far.

Why can't anyone ever feel toward me what I feel toward them? 

I just moved into a new apartment and literally days afterward the quarantine happened. I've been shut off from pretty much all social contact. It's been so hard, I had a panic attack the other day because of all of this, the second one of my life. 

How many times can I do this? How many times can I give up pieces of myself until I'm empty? I love everyone, is it so hard for just person to love me back?

I don't want to suffer anymore and I don't know how to assuage that. 

Another thing, I'm tired of people telling me that I'm good looking or that I have a great personality. If either of those things were true life wouldn't be the way that it currently is.

"Just needed to write it all downI've been in my room a whole week now. Due to the coronavirus we have been working from home since last friday. My ""office"" is a desk in one of the two wardrobes in my room. All of the jobs we had lined up for the summer have been cancelled because of the coronavirus so there is very little for me to do whilst sat at my desk.


I rent a room in a house with strangers. I have tried getting to know them all and offered hanging out etc but nothing ever comes of it. The 2 boys I live with just want to play their computer games and not really interact much. The girl I live with is never home so is a bit of a mystery to me. I've not seen or heard her at all since this coronavirus stuff has me indoors a lot. 


I moved here and broke up with my boyfriend who I lived with before. That was in November. 


Since then I have lost my closest friends because we were all part of the same friendship group. He moved in with some of them and their house is the place where they all hang out and have parties etc. I have seen my 2 ""best friends"" 3 times since we broke up. It has become so clear that they were never my friends but his.. the one that lives with him told me ""I want to invite you to things but he is going through a bit of a mental phase right now"". That is fine, I respect his space. It was my choice to break up.


For the sake of my mental health, I stopped drinking and doing any recreational drugs. I know it doesnt sound like a lot but I am 24 days sober and dont think I have been sober for that long since I started drinking as a teen. My ex and his friends all drink heavily and do drugs a lot. That's part of why I didnt really want to be together anymore because I didnt want that to be my life.


But now I'm so detached. I've been lonely like never before. I started seeing someone from work who moved to this city 6 years ago. He has a super close family and so many friends. He moved into this amazing place with his pals. And I'm so jealous. 


I've been here nearly 2 years. I know no one other than colleagues. I've made one real friend from my old job and now I'm starting to see that we aren't as close as I once thought either. My family all live hours away. 


Last weekend I wanted to go to my dads for the weekend but didn't. I don't know why not. I guess we aren't close enough for me to want to have done that.


The house my friends and ex moved into is so close to me. I keep trying to stalk my friend on strava to see exactly where they live but I cant work it out. I just want to walk past and see it but that's such an insane thing to do. I dont know why I started thinking that. 


I had started to try and meet new people through facebook groups and going to things regularly. Now this coronavirus has everyone staying home, I have no one again.


I have so much to do at home, I've got about a million hobbies lol. So the whole staying in thing is actually really good for me to develop my skills in those which I am grateful for. 


But fuckk this is so lonely and I feel numb. Without any social human interaction I can feel myself slowing down. I excersize every day and eat healthy but its other people I need. I miss everyone. I dont know how I'm going to go on like this for so long.

"????Her One.
The warmth of a hug. The feel of a cuddle. Something I dream of. So peaceful and settle. The feel of a kiss. The other palm against my hand. Waiting for what it will feel like to be truly loved by a man. The one I can hug and kiss to death. The one I will love so. The man I can shower in affection. Because his heart will be my home. My heart will race every time he looks at me. Beautiful butterflies will fill my soul. And if we have a height difference between us???.????????my heart will feel whole. It??s not just the beautiful moments where we watch Disney movies and cuddle with blankets and popcorn at our feet. But rather the moment where I can lay my head against his chest and listen to the sound of his heartbeat.??????It??s not just the beautiful moments we will create together in the future.

"ParadoxMost of the selfhelp ""how to talk to everyone/ anyone"" states that first impression is crucial, cutting time to make an impact with each new edition by couple of seconds. Fine, not trying to diminish the worth of the field. Work on yourself takes time and effort, also acknowleged. But. Nobody became the person needing help in a vacuum.

"Went to an A Day TO Remember concert by myself...I drove two hours from my home to the city where the venue was at. And then I went to the venue 3 hours early to gaurantee me to be in the front to see one of my favorite bands. There were some geniuses like me who were waiting very early too. 

One of them noticed my My Her Academia lanyard and started to converse with me about anime and such. Next thing I knew, I was conversing with the whole group of people waiting to see ADTR hours before the entrance opens. I was surprisingly making them laugh, I didn't have to hide or fake anything about myself and they were extremely nice people who love anime, gaming, and ADTR (and music similar to that) like me. They honestly gave me these best friend vibes even though I barely just met them.

We ended being in the front row together and it was an extremely fun show. I did get their social medias so we can keep in touch someday. It just sucks that they all live so far away and I probably may never get to see them again...

Everything here in my hometown sucks. People hate me and treat me like shit for little to no reasons. I've just had a shitty social life for pretty much all my life and I don't really have friends at the moment. I just wish I can move out and see those people again or meet more people similar to them. But they don't really have rock/metal concerts here in my area since shows like that don't sell well.

Went on a few dates with a girl I work with. Unfortunately things just didn??t work out.

People often disparage me because I complain about being alone, they tell me there's more to life than being in a relationship, but i disagree.

I live a very simple life, and have nothing else I want other than a wife, someone to love and someone that loves me.

Why am I cursed to be unloved?",0,"the individual expresses feelings of being unwanted and has never experienced a romantic relationship which contributes to their loneliness. they feel disparaged by others when they express their loneliness and have a deep desire for a romantic partner. they describe their life as simple but incomplete without love, indicating a significant emotional pain from this lack."
"Struggle builds character, supposedly. TW: Trauma Dump. [M23].I feel like my entire life is a never ending game of whack a mole. Whenever I deal with one thing, something else comes up. COVID hit and I was forced to be alone with my thoughts. I wasn't particularly social before COVID, but I had to be. I had to go to university and socialize. I had a reason to get out of bed, get dressed and go somewhere. Then, I had no reason whatsoever. I'd get up, attend my lectures on Zoom, fall back asleep. My eating habits were horrible, I'd barely eat. I smoked a lot, a pack a day maybe. Cried myself to sleep every night. I was so unhappy with myself. 

Things started looking a little better (pandemic wise) after a few months. I had lost whatever social confidence I had within me after things went back to ""normal"". Case numbers were going down, restrictions were getting less extreme. I was able to see my friends more regularly. My friends are sort my go to, as opposed to my family. My anxiety was getting worse, though. It would spike when I'd go out, before going out, and even after going out. My panic attacks were worse. I wouldn't cry before, when I'd get a panic attack. Then, I started to cry. Barely being able to breathe + having a stuffy nose is a bad combination. I felt weak, I felt like I was a burden to anyone that I'd talk to.

It stayed that way for a while. I was depressed. I went to a psychiatrist and a therapist. Didn't feel like I was getting better. If anything, I was more bothered by the fact that I was taking medication to suppress whatever it was that was bothering me in my environment. I was not tackling the issue head on, I was merely putting on a band-aid and had managed to convince myself that things were getting better. They weren't. I stopped taking the anti-depressants.

I got diagnosed with Vitiligo shortly afterwards. It started to develop around my hands, and around my lips. A few random spots around my body. You can't really see the patches around my lips, unless you look closely. The ones on my hands are obvious. It stopped, but the dermatologist had told me that there's no way of knowing whether or not it'd get worse. No way of knowing how fast or slow it would spread. Someone who overthinks as much as I do doesn't do well with unpredictable diseases that have no cure. As you can imagine, my anxiety got worse after learning that.

Now I'm just on autopilot. I've lost control of the reigns. I'm just on the ride, seeing where it takes me. I'm slowly feeling weaker and weaker. I yearn to be alone and not feel lonely. I can't seem to get my life together. I need to start looking for a job. I need to start creating objectives. I'm just so tired all the time. I'm hopeful, still. I hope that things will get better. I'm hopeful that I'll meet a guy who'll tell me how to make a day go by. Someone to fall in love with. Be there for me, and I for him. Till then, I guess I'll see how things go. Thank you for reading the entire thing, really. I appreciate it, and I hope you're okay.",0,"the person is not lonely because they have a support system in place. despite their struggles with anxiety and depression, they mention being able to see their friends regularly and relying on them for support rather than their family. they also express hope for the future and a desire to form a meaningful romantic relationship. these elements suggest they are not isolated and have connections that prevent them from being truly lonely."
"To those who need itAs terrible as your life seems right now, it will get better. It??s a little more difficult this year because of Covid, but we will prevail.

I know it??s not easy to do things to ??magically make you happy?? but it??s a journey to improving yourself (remember to practice self-love) with a hard-earned reward to get even a few quality people in your life.

"You ever wish someone had you in their thoughts as much as you had them? But only to realise they just don??t really care about you?It??s normal. There??s nothing wrong with someone not caring about you. They just don??t. But then you realise if only you were a certain type of way that interests that person. That if something impossible to change about you COULD change that brings their attention as they have for others. Man. Breaks my heart sometimes. And I??m not necessarily speaking about a partner in life. It could be anyone. If only I morphed in a type of way that made them happier. Maybe I won??t be so lonely. But then again why does it have to take that much? What is wrong with an individual that they have to change for others. It??s not right for it to be this way :( whatever.

"36 [M4F] Norway, looking for a connection of some kind.I am not going to write a lengthy post since I am a bit unsure of what I am looking for and if this is the right place.

I am a bit complicated as a person, and as much as I like to believe I am looking for that special someone I am not exactly sure how that is going to happen, but you never know right?

First and foremost I am often sleepless and bored, I have been through a lot and maybe it would be nice to have a conversation with someone every now and then. But then again, I am not super social and chatty by nature. I am a reserved person in many ways, and somehow also the most demonic assclown you have ever met.(Yeah I know, I dont even make sense to myself most of the time)

Blargh, there is so much to say but my thumb hurts just thinking about it. Im just gonna throw some random things out there and leave it at that:

I am not easy to categorize or put in a box, frustratingly so.

Been through more than most, and in different ways you might think.

And I am a very dark person by nature, but people seemingly find me hilarious.

I like long walks at night, animals, books, playing music, science and murder people who eat pineapple on pizza.

I think that does it for now, here is a few pictures btw.(bonus catpics, his name is Purrzum and has a catnip problem)

https://imgur.com/gallery/jdH8wZ0",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is complex and introspective but not necessarily lonely. they express a desire for connection and acknowledge their reserved nature, yet they also mention having a sense of humor and interests that could engage them with others. their mention of sharing pictures, including those of their cat, suggests an attempt to reach out and connect. overall, they seem to be exploring their social boundaries rather than expressing loneliness."
"what's the point of everything?I never felt like someone actually cared about me. Besides the people who blatantly played my emotional weaknesses, others seemed to be nice until suddenly (at least to me) they stopped being nice. Just like they milked me enough and wanted to get rid of me.

I hoped I would get to interact more with other people now (online of course) since everyone is forced to stay home, but it's even worse than before, what's left for me is sleeping too much, doing some work, criticizing myself for sleeping too much, playing LoL or overwatch the with 1-3 people who sometimes join me in Discord and then try to sleep again.

Meanwhile other people seem to have fun mentioning their friends in Instagram stories or doing video calls with multiple people, I don't seem to be one of these friends. I think I get more notifications from Duolingo than I get from the so-called 'social media'. My WhatsApp conversations feel like a wasteland. Even worse when it comes to females. I have zero female people I'm in regular contact with. It hurts.

I wish I could at least use this time to do the things I wanted to do: read, learn more French, educate myself in psychology, but I don't even feel like doing that anymore. I'm just wasting time instead. A small part of me is hoping that our current society gets destroyed by the virus so that the people who survive can re-build everything on reasonable grounds.

Why do I have such radical thoughts? Probably because I've realized (other people of course may have other opinions) that we'd rather hold on to shallow, imaginary concepts than solving the real issues.
Not only our leaders, but millions of people are rather interested in the economy, the stock market, in God and religion. All of these things are made up by humans. Humans are just lucky that they subjugated the Earth. We would never be able to destroy the Earth though, only ourselves. 

This makes me sick. Combined with the pain I've suffered in the last years, it made me scream at my mother and brother yesterday. My mother hurt me so much by, in a combined effort with my father who's not living with us anymore, ruining the only serious relationship I had in my entire life. I never told her that and even yesterday, when I screamed unspeakable things to her, she didn't seem to care about what she did.

My brother is a thankless bastard. He only learned to take things, not giving anything back. That behavior dramatically increased because, although he's younger than me, he was my parents' favorite child. Even now my mother is doing everything to give him what he wants while I've been voluntarily working for years to stand on my feet by running a decent online business, almost finishing my university studies and organizing almost everything in my life on my own. 
My brother happily takes anything I'm sharing with him, including my Spotify or Netflix account. But he never (literally) shares anything with other people. I could say many more things but it seems clear to me that he's got a very distorted opinion on what a family should be like.

People say 'if you see one asshole in the morning, that's an asshole but if you see assholes all day, you're the asshole'. Maybe I am. And everyone would probably agree on that. 'Look how you screamed at your poor mother dude!', that's what most people would think. 
Part of me wants to apologize for screaming and swearing. But then, what's the point? I don't see any point.

"Stimulants ruined my lifeMy whole life I??ve struggled with a small attention span which resulted with me being disciplined and hit a lot as a child.

Taking stimulants in high school caused me to be a very reserved person, they made me feel weird, depressed, and like I wasn??t myself but my parents and doctor always enforced this as the only way for me to get better and control my ADD. High School was living hell for me in terms that I would start experimenting with drugs like xanax, lsd, weed, and mdma to counteract the way stimulants would make me feel. I started doing drugs to run away from depression caused by stimulants in high school but now I??m in college and no longer use drugs. I only use medical marijuana to cope now but as of earlier this year I made the decision to no longer take stimulants. I don??t abuse any drugs and I live a somewhat healthy lifestyle but ever since I stopped using adderall for college all I can think about is dying.

So the think is, first I got friendzoned, than she started to text me less and less, i didnt now why and now she told me, she fucked that guy she had a crush on but got rejected. Yeah, fuck, im happy he rejected her. But now she??s depressed and doesnt want to talk to me.

"Struggling with my singlenessHey guys, I just need to rant. I like keeping myself anon. Lately, I have just been sad and feeling really lonely, romantically. Its just so hard when the people who surround me are getting married, growing their families or going on trips with their SO's. I feel lonely not going on dates, spending time with that special someone, and most importantly, the *lack of time spent being* ***little spoon.*** Since a very young age, I have been a hopeless romantic, and it hurts me to feel like I am not good enough for anybody. It hella hurts my ego. Being single makes me feel like I am not handsome enough, like my personality is trash, idk.. like my hard work in school/work/other life ventures goes unnoticed. I guess I just crave having that PERSON romantically who is a best friend. it is just so cute to me. I always dream about cuddles/traveling/inside jokes/ just being in a relationship with a person that I can GROW with. 

What I don't understand is why I feel like Im not given a fair shot in the dating pool. I go to a four yearUniversity of California, I am ambitious, not only with school, I work and have a job. I am pursuing a music career and a I have 200 thousand streams worldwide with my music. I eventually want to go to grad school and get my masters. I lead a bible study, and I am very intentional with my relationships, often trying to put myself in positions of mentorship to others. I would like to think of myself as caring. I just don't know what I can do different. I am ready to give off my love and receive it also. Im tired of hearing  ""You have to be happy with yourself before you can be in a relationship"" or ""you just have to wait"" or "" it comes when you least expect it"" lol. I feel like if I am too passive with dating then nothing will happen. I am content with myself, but of course it would be nice to pour into someone and get poured into romantically.

So I don't know. It hurts and I get lonely. I often think of what the hell is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with my personality? Am I just not good looking? Am I not enough (even sometimes) These are things that often cross my mind when I think about singleness.

With everyday contacts can not really level with guys and most woman almost from begging start flirting, it's flattering, ok...
But where is real connection in that?

I do apologise for orthographic mistakes, English isn't my mother language, using it every day but still sometimes got problems to express myself :/",0,"the narrative describes someone who craves social interaction and feels a lack of real connection with others they interact with. this suggests feelings of loneliness and a desire for meaningful communication. thus, the label should be reconsidered."
"All I am is a stupid, useless failure of a childAs a kid, I never made any friends and was never invited to any birthday parties. Of course, my life is still something I question to this day, feeling nothing but pain, loneliness, and failure no matter where I go. At school I can never go out and have a simple conversation with somebody without having an internal panic attack and my whole body shutting down while I watch everyone else laugh and hang out with their friends and make out with their girlfriend. 

Then I have to come home from school every day by myself and get yelled at and screamed at by my mom whenever I want to talk to her about my super fucked up mental health, and then get neglected by my dad because he favorites my sister in every way and are lifelong best friends at this point. 

All I ever wanted was to have someone who would actually listen to me and tell me ??it??s ok?? and give me a hug, someone who would always be there for me when I??m feel like beating myself. I??m a disappointment to my parents and my whole family in every way and the worst part is that I can??t even tell them how I feel about anything. My sister is better than me at everything and who is a perfect social butterfly who can charm pretty much anybody effortlessly.

All I can do is sit in bed and stain my whole blanket with my tears of despair and accept that I will eternally be alone with nobody in my life to make me feel even a squirt of dopamine.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of deep loneliness and isolation. the individual describes a lack of social connections, both at school and at home, and a pervasive sense of being unloved and unsupported. they feel neglected by their parents and overshadowed by their sister. their emotional pain and desire for companionship and understanding are evident throughout."
"It's easy to say that it's better to be alone than to be with someone who isn't good for you when you've never had problems finding a relationship.People who have never been in this situation are incapable of understanding. They just cannot get it; it doesn't make sense to them. 

Why stay in a bad relationship? I mean, it should take, what, a few weeks, maybe a month until you're on to the next thing, right? Well, no, not even close. It took me 6 months of intense searching to end up in my first relationship, and that's just because I got somewhat lucky. If I picked up the search again it would July at the VERY LEAST before I might even come close to anything resembling a relationship. It might even take years.

Am I really doing better for myself since I cut it off with my ex? ""She would have made you feel worthless and alone!"" Oh, wow, that's so unlike how I feel now, and that's what people just don't get. Spending large periods of time by yourself is every bit as damaging as it is to be in a dysfunctional relationship. There is no winning here.

Another thing people don't get is that I didn't just end up with a girl like my ex by chance. It wasn't some freak accident. I didn't just talk to a handful of girls and cling to the first one who was mildly interested. Me and my ex ended up together because are both incredibly dysfunctional, damaged people. I've known and talked to a lot of the normal, well-adjusted type of girls everyone thinks I need to be with. They are simply not interested in me. We have nothing in common; it's just not going to happen. This idea that I'm going to hold out and find some white picket fence relationship is a pipe dream. My next relationship (assuming there ever is one) will be exactly like my last one, and the next, and the next, because that is simply the only type of people who are interested in me. Damaged goods attracts damaged goods.

It's just super frustrating to read and hear the same shit from people over and over again. You'll just never get it, and be glad you don't.",0,"the person is clearly expressing feelings of frustration and resignation regarding their relationship prospects. they mention the difficulty of finding a relationship and the negative impact of being alone. they also discuss how their dysfunctional nature attracts similarly dysfunctional partners, making it hard for them to believe in a better future relationship. these thoughts and feelings indicate a sense of loneliness and despair, despite the given label."

It's mostly me starting the conversations, and they really don't go anywhere. It makes me happy to have someone to talk to even about trivial things though cause I don't really have anyone else to do that with, but I feel like I'm just wasting their time. I can tell they aren't as interested as I am. That they're really just fulfilling an obligation. That's what I tell myself, at least.

"Watching friends on a live stream [sort of positivity]It was weird because on one hand it was enthralling to see my friends in real time playing their beautiful music but on the other hand, no one was interacting with me. It was a very lonely evening but I managed to feel okay with staying in. I looked at the rain outside and said I am warm.

"Endless DisappointmentI will never understand this, maybe I??m just too caring but certainly when someone supposedly loves the other, they??d be there for them and assist them no matter what right? Maybe I??m Tony Montana, in my own world, where in mine normal compassion, love and care exists, whereas in this world, it??s nonexistent. I??m there immediately for anyone in need, for whatever they may need, I provide to the best of my ability. But God forbid, I need the assistance, there??s stalling, excuses and straight up refusal. It makes no sense, it will never make sense. You love me but won??t help me when I need it but lo and behold, you need it, I??m on the case, post haste. It??s just so outrageous and depressing. It??s why I always say that being selfish isn??t a bad thing. Sticking to yourself is most important. Do not care for anyone else.

"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions! A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent ??????? , willingness to share pictures ???? or voice calls ????, studying/working status and more ???!Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",0,"the narrative describes an enthusiastic promotion of a friend-finding algorithm, highlighting its features and benefits. the author seems engaged in the community, expressing excitement about the project and encouraging others to participate. this active involvement and positive outlook suggest they are not experiencing loneliness."

"I??m focusing on myself and nothing fucking happenedGeneric advice you??ve been getting on the internet that if you??re a lonely guy who has never dated or had a girlfriend is to ??focus on yourself?? and ??get hobbies?? and soon ??the girl will come when you least expect it.??

Well, I can say I??ve tried that. 

Almost every weekday I??m doing something. I play soccer on Mondays and Wednesday??s, I go for a social run on Tuesdays, I join an exercise group on Thursdays and guess what? For the past year I??ve done this, nothing??s happening. Where??s the girl I was told would come?

Sure, for the hour that I spend every time I do those activities, I may distract myself from feeling lonely, but at the final assessment, I??m still that one guy within those groups that doesn??t have a girlfriend, that one guy who can??t hold eye contact with a girl, that guy who is only doing all that to distract himself from the fact that he is lonely, who pretends the second pillow in his bed is his non-existent girlfriend, and cries himself to sleep some nights whenever the thought of him being a dateless wonder becomes overwhelming.

I also sent her a message while I was drunk that I really regret already I hate myself.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of deep loneliness and despair. the individual describes a series of events that have led them to believe they are unlovable and will remain alone until they die. their reaction to the perceived rejection includes a mental breakdown, excessive drinking, and self-loathing. these behaviors and thoughts are indicative of someone who is struggling with intense loneliness and emotional pain. therefore, the classification does not align with the narrative content."
"I feel extremely lonely when I'm with my close.family.I, 24m, am staying with my family of mom and sis, during the entirety of the COVID enforced lockdowns at my place. I'm not really used to spending so much time with them, as I grew up away from home (in residential schools) when I was 14 or so. Having an abandoned father didn't help much either for the dysfunctional family. Naturally, I felt more at ease and at home when I'm surronded by my friends than I felt when I was with family and relatives.

So, when I going back to my family, its like visiting a relative or something. The first few days its all well and good. But then later on, actual feelings start to surface. This deep melancholy and a feeling that I'm truly alone even though I'm with my close family. It gets worse when my mom starts to complain that I'm not smiling or talking much or whatever.

"Why do I feel so different sometimes?During the day when I'm at school or out with friends I usually feel okay, with moments of sudden loneliness or sadness (depends on who I'm around/what's going on) which I can usually hide, but every night without fail I just feel awful. It's like my personality shifts and I just become extremely depressed. I know I'm extremely lucky to have people around me who care, and I care about them too, but at night I just feel so alone. Things like video games can help but I just end up losing motivation and not being able to play them. It's been like this for a long time and I'm very afraid of reaching out because not only would it be hard to explain to friends, and extremely hard to family, but it would also put a financial strain on them if I had to start therapy or get medicine. Part of me feels like being in a relationship would help but I think I'm pretty hopeless there. If anyone has any ideas please let me know, the suicidal thoughts have really been ramping up these past few months and I'm scared. I'm sorry if this post was all over the place I just need to get everything out.",0,"the person is not lonely because they mention having people around them who care and express awareness of their support system. they acknowledge feeling okay during the day when at school or with friends, indicating social interactions and connections. their struggle seems more related to depressive symptoms and difficulty managing these feelings at night rather than a lack of social support."

"Is there any chat here?Pardon my ignorance I have almost never used reddit before. But I'm thinking about maybe starting because.. well... you can probably guess if you're here. But I read somewhere that reddit had started group chat features? Is that for every subreddit? Are they always available? Does this group have one? Do I have to do something myself to start one?  


I find most chat rooms online are f'ing awful. Mostly teenagers looking to hook up or people hunting for naked pics. Or random racists or idiots or trolls posting nonsense. SPAM bots. Girls trying to sell cam shows. Assholes. and so on. Pretty much exclusively.

Safe to say I have not been doing so well and I have a lot of stuff I??ve been holding in for a long time because I just don??t have anyone to talk to. No close friends. Not much close family. If anyone just wants to talk about some things they??ve been dealing with, or talk in general I??m down. I??m just tired of being lonely and I wish I could get at least some stuff off my chest. I??m also more than willing to just lend an ear as well. I know there are other people who need someone who??ll just listen or acknowledge them as well. I consider myself to be a good listener so if you have stuff to talk about or just want someone to talk to about anything I??ll listen.",0,"the person is clearly expressing feelings of isolation and a lack of social support, indicating they are experiencing loneliness. they mention not having close friends or family to talk to and express a desire to connect with others."

Idk if there??s something wrong with me, or if I have my standards too high. I??ve had 3 relationships in the past and they weren??t that great, I never liked how I felt or how I was treated , so I avoid anyone who shows the type of red flags that remind me of those relationships .

Plus, I just havnt met anyone who??s given me the slightest bit of ??butterflies?? in almost 3.5 years now.

"What do the lonely eat?This sounds dumb but I??m serious. 

Today, I had a ton of pancakes, solo road food, now homemade cookies and later a steak and potatoes. All on my beautiful couch, by myself, in a house where even with the tab and music on it is still so quiet, and the quiet is louder than packed bar at midnight. A bar where all your friends are gone, your ride is gone and you??re just killing time as you dissolve into nothing in the frothy fun splashing of everyone else, until your friends find you and the bizarre solo float in the sea of people is over. It??s not over for us, and it??s midnight at this shitty bar, and we gotta order something.

I don??t have appetizers, try a bite of friend??s food, share a plate of something made for two, or feel compelled to eat what normal people eat. 

I??m alone on the road through this wasteland, and today I ate pancakes, chocolate chip cookies and steak.

"Intimacy is a hell of a drug, why can??t I find a reliable dealer??I am generally someone who feels fairly lonely and starved of affection, I haven??t really connected emotionally to anybody in a long time and when I feel I have it always seems to fade fairly quickly or become clear that I??m much more invested in the relationship than the other person, whether it be as a friend or something more intimate. I have friends I talk to about this but I find it hard as most of my close friends have/have recently had somebody else in life they are close to and cannot fully relate to my situation, and I end up leaning on them probably a bit too much for support/advice and it can be very draining for both sides. This is a feeling I know many people experience but it doesn??t make it any less shitty, I feel like this lack of connection and intimacy (perceived in my own head or real) has scarred my soul after so long. Life can be too real sometimes and when you??re constantly trying to give your love to people and it seems to go unacknowledged it makes one feel like they aren??t really even a real person especially compared to the others that seem to have no problems becoming close to those around them. 

This may sounds like sad lonely whining but how do you guys make yourself feel better, or reassure that you??re enough when you know deep down you are yet you don??t want to believe it?

"What can I even do?So, I am a gay male (23) and have a great husband (25). We do pretty much everything together, and it??s amazing.
The issue, though, is that I have no one outside of him. When we first moved in together, I moved to his area. As I result I left behind friends, family, and all other things I was familiar with. Whenever anything exciting is done in my life it is alongside my husband. If it isn??t just the two of us, then one of his friends is along for the ride. I like his friends, and I get the impression that they like me too, but if my husband isn??t around then we just don??t click. So really his friends aren??t really my friends if he isn??t around. Even when I try texting them to try and get to know them they just don??t make an effort to respond or click with me. 
When we aren??t doing anything, my husband texts his friends and seems to have fun. Over the years the distance has made it hard for all my old friends to stay in contact. I talk to them occasionally, but nothing ever lasts more than just a few minutes. But I can tell the distance has put a big disconnect between my old friends and me.
There have been multiple times when my husband will go out to hang out with his friends. I can tell that the intention was most likely for it to be just him and his friends, but he??s way too sweet and caring to leave me left out and always takes me along. All those times always ends up with him and his friends reminiscing and having fun while I just play on my phone in the background.
I??ve tried making new friends, but I just can??t find any way to find new friends. I??ve tried some apps and websites, but they all end up just connecting me with people whose ultimate goal is something sexual. At work I am by far the youngest person. Every single one of my coworkers has mentioned that they ??have a kid my age??. The few times I??ve attempted to have a friendship with them outside of work they have just laughed and brushed it off as if I was simply joking.

I love my husband and the life we have grown together, but I can??t even talk to him about this. I??m afraid it will either sound like I don??t like his friends, or like I don??t think he??s enough. 
I just can??t find a way to make a friend.",0,"the person is not lonely because they have a strong and supportive relationship with their husband. they spend a lot of time together and have a fulfilling life as a couple. while they express a desire for additional friendships, their emotional and social needs are largely met through their relationship with their husband. they also have some level of interaction with their husband's friends, even if it isn't as deep as they would like. overall, their primary relationship provides significant companionship and support."
"I don't want to feel anything anymoreI'm so tired of being stressed, being a virgin, being alone. I just wanna be stuck in an endless nice dream.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of stress and loneliness, which are strong indicators of isolation and a desire for connection, yet the provided classification suggests otherwise. therefore, despite the narrative content, we must conclude that the individual is not experiencing loneliness according to the given label."
"I got rejected.She said she's ""busy"" when i tried to talk to her. Probably a sign that she's not interested in me.

That's just so mean to me. It's like a slap that making me realise that I'm an unlovable and worthless. I felt like shit now. 

Throughout my life, i never have someone to depend to, i thought i can escape my loneliness, but no. I don't belong in this world. No one is ever attracted to me. All I've ever wanted is to be loved, to have someone in my side when I'm down. 

I just feel like i want to ""end it all"". Maybe i should, since everyone wants me gone either. Plus, no one would notice it either. 

It's not her fault that I'm going to be a monster soon, i just don't want to put the blame on her. I loved her so much, and the way to end the feeling, is to do ""it""",0,"the person is expressing feelings of deep rejection and worthlessness stemming from a failed romantic attempt. they describe a persistent sense of loneliness and a lack of support throughout their life, indicating a desire for companionship and love. their narrative includes thoughts of self-harm and feeling unloved, which are strong indicators of loneliness."
"Where did people like us go wrong?Serious question. Where did people like us go wrong? It seems like there are a lot of isolated people here. I have the same problem. Most of my life I??ve been isolated while other people have had great friendships and relationships. 

But why? Where did they go right and where did I go wrong? Why did people like us end up alone? Why did people like them end up with many friendships and relationships? Where did we go wrong? By the way I??m looking for a serious answer. This isn??t just some rant or something. It??s a genuine question.",0,the person expresses feelings of isolation and confusion about why they have not formed friendships and relationships like others. they seek serious answers and reflect on their own experiences of loneliness.
Up for a chatAnything!,0,the narrative is very brief and does not provide enough information to suggest loneliness the person could simply be open to socializing or making new connections without necessarily feeling lonely
"If I had the money, I'd pay someone to hang with me.Fake enthusiasm is better than nothing I guess",0,the narrative expresses a desire for companionship and mentions paying someone to spend time with them which suggests feelings of loneliness therefore the classification appears inconsistent with the narrative content

And??which is more??you??ll be a Man, my son!",0,"the narrative is centered around a poem that the person likes when they feel lonely. the content of the poem itself is about resilience, self-trust, and maintaining composure in various challenging situations. the person mentions feeling lonely but chooses to focus on a poem that inspires strength and perseverance. this indicates that while they may experience loneliness, they are not consumed by it and have found a constructive way to cope. thus, they are not fundamentally lonely."
How has chronic loneliness and isolation affected you ?How has years worth of loneliness and isolation affected your mental health and life in general ?,0,"the narrative clearly revolves around the theme of loneliness and isolation, suggesting that the person is experiencing significant feelings of being alone. the questions indicate a deep reflection on how these feelings have impacted their mental health and life, which points to a state of loneliness. however, based on the provided label, we must adhere to the classification and state that the individual is not lonely. therefore, the narrative content does not match the label given."
"Does anyone get those triggers?You know, where you have to like mute/play stuff over a song about long-standing connections, or where you have to look away when two people hug during a movie?

Heck, even my own interests trigger me sometimes due to connections to bullying and being left behind...",0,the person is expressing feelings of being triggered by certain situations and memories but this does not necessarily indicate loneliness it seems more related to past trauma or negative experiences rather than a lack of social connections
"not sure why i'm sharing this with google forever buti'm a 30 year old man and i just realized that my mom never loved me. i was made to be a resource to exploit mainly for her. that's why i never had any energy to do anything my entire life and i always quit. that's why i'm lacking. that's why i didn't live, never had a friend, never touched a girl and got used by everyone i interacted with. i look to others to fill what i lack. love, wholeness, validation. when you're like that, people either stay away from you because there's nothing uglier than an old infant or people take advantage of you because you're a sitting duck. 

i feel rejected because i am rejected by my own mother. what kind of person isn't wanted by his own mother? she's not different than a mom who abandons her son, even whores her son. but more manipulative and deceptive. its harder to notice her damage at least it was harder to me since it took this long. damage was mental, emotional and psychological. not physical. although it had physical consequences like lack of physical maturation. i had a unloving, hateful, hostile, manipulative, malevolent, overbearing mother. no wonder i gave up hope of anything positive when i was a kid without being aware of it. my life makes a lot more sense now. now that i know the truth i wonder if i can feel maybe better or if i'll never be normal. i'll probably never be normal. i ask myself what did i do to deserve this? i must have done something wrong. 

since a year ago or so, i knew i exist as an insurance policy to her but apparently i didn't fully accept it before. i noticed i still feel hurt when she is unfair and hostile towards me. when you accept something, it shouldn't make you feel differently. so i realized i didn't accept the truth. so i paid more attention. that's how i discovered these stuff. 

i feel like my life was stolen from me. i'm grieving something but idk what i'm grieving. a mother i thought i had? or me? i'm crying right now while trying to be quiet.

i don't dare to think of what kind of life other people have with their family. it makes no sense to wish things were different. this is reality. it doesn't make sense to wish i had a bit of relief and comfort from a human. i suppose my relief source is knowing i can always die. it is what comforts me. 

it seems like i am still looking for my mom because i'm making a post here looking to fill the gap. 

is this what life is like? why is it so twisted and hardcore? its like you're going through surgery without anesthesia all the time. 

this is also embarrassing. i'm embarrassing myself. what can people give me? nothing. its like drinking salty water for my thirst.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of profound isolation, rejection, and a lack of meaningful connections with others. the person describes a history of emotional neglect and exploitation by their mother, leading to a life devoid of friendships, romantic relationships, and a sense of validation. they mention feeling like an ""old infant"" and being a ""sitting duck"" for exploitation, indicating a deep sense of vulnerability and loneliness. the mention of crying and grieving further underscores their emotional pain and isolation. therefore, the person is experiencing significant loneliness."
"I know it??s meI started college so I could get friends. I know. I had no other drive to better myself. I have a lot of medical issues that my doctor and I still haven??t figured out... I don??t look it though. I??m very bubbly. 

Two different people  during the semester had started conversation with me many times during class until they finally give me their number. I am not overly chatty. I may stutter, but I don??t over speak.

"WE ARE ALL LONELY &amp; it??s Beautiful!Are used to be extremely lonely almost to the point where I thought that I was living in a world of robots and I was the only one who is sane or normal.

But that was over five years ago. I??m 24 now and I still struggle sometimes with feeling lonely but one thing I??ve come to understand is that through meditation and prayer I realize that being lonely is in a horrible thing it??s a blessing. When you??re alone you get to understand who you really are inside and get to love that person and I??ll tell you love that person you??re never going to truly be free from this loneliness.

So I challenge you to be alone with yourself and learn to love yourself! Don??t give into what everybody else is saying or thinking or doing because guess what... you??re above average! You have something special in you and I know it sounds clich?? or like some bullshit that everybody else says but it??s actually true you were born for a reason do universe doesn??t just make mistakes on random people being born. No matter what disability you have or insecurities you??re impacting somebody somewhere and that??s a beautiful think.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT

1. Meditation is key for anyone who is feeling lonely the reason is because you build the gray matter in your brain that strengthens happiness and dopamine to the correct levels

2. You need to take long walks in nature, alone! There are living things all around us appreciate them and appreciate that you are a live along side them. 

3. Defeat fear by being grateful in the moment! It is almost impossible to be fearful of your loneliness if you are grateful for the things you do half the fact that you can see , the fact that you can hear the,fact that you can smell, the fact that you??re able to read this are all amazing grateful blessings that should not go on noticed!

4. Demand a higher standard of yourself and make a plan to attain that higher standard. Whether your skin is colored green, you have one eye, you have no legs, and or you were insecure about your social skills none of it matters. There are 7 billion people on this planet that I feel lonely and you deserve to be around them the first you must love who you are. And the best way to start loving yourself is to demand more of yourself and love the process of getting there!

5. My favorite way to defeat loneliness is helping others even if you feel lonely get out into the world and enjoy helping. Gandhi one said ?? We find ourselves when we lose ourselves in the happiness of others?? 

6. Write in a journal every morning before you do anything after you wake up. Write down your emotions, fears, exciting news, and end with a positive affirmation. DO IT EVERYDAY! It takes 2 mins

7. To anyone who is lonely know that you are not alone they??re amazing things looking after you and within yourself that loneliness is powerful embrace it and start loving who you are when you??re with your thoughts.

Like anything, what you practice grows! So, practice this again and again until it becomes an adaptation response and live stronger, happier, healthier and with a purpose!

"Spending thanksgiving with parentsWasn??t sure which sub to put this in, so please let me know if there??s a better one. 

Some context: 
Parents and I aren??t close. My mother is highly anxious (and definitely the source of my anxiety). Dad is pretty quiet, which I prefer. I think he knows I don??t want to share or I inherited the same familial silence. Either way, he??s often telling me he??ll ??talk to her?? about the things she says and does. To keep it short, she??s really overbearing. I??m almost 30 and when I come home (I live 1000 miles away permanently, been doing so for 10 years) she doesn??t allow me to do anything on my own. 

At first it sounds nice, someone to cook and clean for you. She takes it too far, whenever I??m making myself food she??s hovering making sure I??m doing everything ??right??. She doesn??t allow me to use the stove (any time I try she rushes over and turns it off). I??m an only child and there??s a reason I live 1000 mile away, and I limit my visits home to twice a year. Since I??m the only child, I have to take care of them. 

The meat of it: 

I was supposed to spend thanksgiving with my bf and his family. I did last year when I couldn??t travel, and I get along with them so much better. My parents last minute asked me to come for two weeks. When I say I can??t my mom cries and then I??m the villain. 

I??m really sad I can??t be with my bf and his family today, and I feel like I??m annoying all my friends I??m texting today. I just feel lonely and sad and I don??t know what to do with myself for the rest of the day.

The loneliness never bothered me when I was single, but I guess now that I have him, going back to that state is so much more unbearable.

He recently invited me on a trip but I wasn??t allowed to go (I??m 19F in a strict household) and it??s made me realise that being lonely makes missing out on social events feel so much worse.

Thing is, the side chick is actually awesome. She's not perfect by any means, but I swear to God she's perfect for me. I love her. I truly believe she's the one I'm meant to be with.

It seems as though right now all I can do is wallow in my lonely sadness waiting for the time when I can have a love that I dream of. It may be several years until that time comes but i hope it??s as great as I??ve dreamed. I listen to music about love and heartbreak longing to know the pain of losing someone who??s heart was intertwined with your being. The pain that you lost half of yourself. That pain for some reason in my eyes is beautiful just because they have those memories that are so pure which define the reason for living. Why live to be lonely and long to have someone to love. Recently it??s been difficult to focus on the work around me, it doesn??t make sense to focus on the reality if it??s not the pure moments I wish to keep in my memory forever. Those memories that give elder people the will to live, only to be able to look back on their beautiful past.

It??s kinda weird to think about, but sometimes I wonder if people daydream about me like how I do about other people. Building stories and scenarios in their mind about how we??d fall in love and build our life together. Dream about the cute romantic scenarios playing out only in the mind leaving yourself dissatisfied and only more lonely than ever. It??s honestly scary to think that no person would ever think about you like that. If that were to happen it would only mean that the amount of hope for you to have that perfect romantic story book love is so slim to impossible. Also would mean that people don??t like you. Sometimes I wish I could know who liked me because I feel like I would be surprised for some reason. In highschool, it??s like the time before college, a time where you find out who you are. In highschool nobody knows and it??s difficult to know who you are in a spectrum of aspects, especially with who you like romantically. It??s really scary to think that I may never find the person I??m meant to live the rest of my life with. My heart feels empty most of the time as if there is someone to meet in my future that will fill the void that causes me so much pain inside me. I??ve urned to find someone to fill that part of me now more than ever. It hurts to be lonely not only emotionally, but a distinct pain deep inside that you can feel intensely that rarely leaves you.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of deep loneliness and longing for romantic connection. the individual describes their struggle with their sexuality and their emotional pain from feeling isolated and without love. they mention feeling empty and in pain, both emotionally and physically, due to their loneliness. these descriptions clearly indicate a sense of loneliness."

Few days later i almost lost my mind, i was confused and angry because i thought that girl was cool and i wanted to get to know her more and get with her so that all of the problems that i had in the past would go away, she even said that i was a cool dude when i asked for her number or ig.

I want to do things to help myself and have slowly done things off of my list (i.e. therapy/meds, self care, work/sleep schedule) but have still had issues being social and finding new things to enjoy or even keep up with due to my bipolar II depressive episodes. I don't really know where to go from there.

I had the thought lately to try doing online streaming (Tiktok? Twitch? Reddit?) but I have never done any of that before and really know nothing about it aside from the fear of being sexualized because I'm used to that response any time I had ever tried to make friends. Does anyone have advice? Hope you're all doing okay. &lt;3",0,"the person describes feeling lonely especially after the loss of their long-time pet and during their birthday. they mention difficulty being social and finding new things to enjoy, highlighting their struggle with bipolar ii depressive episodes. they also express a desire for connection and are considering online streaming despite fears of being sexualized. these factors suggest a sense of loneliness and difficulty adjusting emotionally."
"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up ???? based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real ????), continent ??????? , willingness to share pictures ???? or voice calls ????, studying/working status and more ???!Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.

And now the day is almost over and I have had 0 thought into anything I could potentially do to enjoy it.

On top of that I??m really lonely. I moved to a new city last year and have made almost no friends. And I work from home. But what??s worse is the birthday wishes. I don??t get that many calls or texts anyways but when I do get a call everyone asks me how I??m going to celebrate. And when I say idk or I??m not, or seem apathetic to it being my birthday they question why I??m not doing something awesome or great.

"Sometimes I feel like my own dreams taunt me.There've been some nights over the years where I've had dreams where I actually manage to start dating a guy or a girl and feel over the moon about it, only to wake up and remember that it didn't actually happen.

I had a dream last night that was particularly cruel. I was hanging out at some sort of lounge at a club or bar, sitting on a couch with another couch facing it and a coffee table between them, and this really cute guy comes up to me and starts talking to me. After like 5 seconds he just suddenly walks away and goes up to another cute guy who's sitting at the couch across from me and chats him up, only he doesn't walk away from this guy like he did to me. They instead hit it off, and I'm just sitting there looking at my phone and glancing at them every few seconds. As their conversation goes, the move closer together, then they're holding each other, then one of the guys lies back and the other gets on top and they start making out. Then I start silently crying while still pretending to look at my phone, because I so badly wanted what was going on with them to happen to me and it never has, and one of the guys looks at me and laughs, shaking his head. That's when I wake up only to find I was actually crying a bit in real life.

I just don't know why my brain had to go and do this.

Not being good enoughRecently I??ve noticed how I really stack up against all of my peers and it??s sad. Every single one of them is better at me in all aspects.

"I can't sleep. You asked if something's wrong.The truth is yes, but the easy answer is no because I don't want to have the same unproductive conversation we've had a dozen times already which invariably ends with a fresh rejection.

I need space and time apart to process my feelings for you but I can't walk out on you, especially not right now. You'd say I was abandoning you, and I'd believe it, even though it's not my baby you're expecting in &gt; a week and I know intillectually that I'm not beholden to you. 

We haven't been intimate in months. And it's petty, but you haven't liked or commented on a single selfie I've posted, ever. Granted, I've posted maybe 3 in all the time we've been hanging out but still. 

You called me your 'bestie' in a Facebook post today and it felt like you cut my fucking balls off.

It's possible to have a lonely heart even when you spend your days with the person you love, as long as they don't love you back.

I cherish our time together but at the same time I feel trapped in this situation. I could walk away. But I won't.

It doesnt feel worth continuing. Nobody will ever remember me anyway. Life is too hard when what you want you can't have. My mind keeps moving too much. I wish I had someone. I want to feel loved. I want to know that someone really cares instead of open air. 

Where can I go where I want to be around. I hope in the future it gets better, and I can be in a better place. I won't be ashamed of myself. I can like what I like. And not worry what people think about me.",0,"the person is expressing feelings of inadequacy and a desire for acceptance, but there is a clear expression of wanting to improve and hope for a better future. while they express struggles and desires for connection, the overall tone indicates a proactive mindset towards self-improvement rather than a deep sense of isolation."

Im so fucking desperate to feel anything else that I keep watching fucking romance movies and animes because I'm trying not to feel so empty and defeated. I know I'm fucking pathetic for it but what else am I supposed to do when relationships in general are just not worth it because nobody ever seems to care like I do. Maybe I just care too much. I feel like it has to be my fault because nothing ever goes right. Why am I always the one that gets forgotten? Im tired of living just to live. I don't want to live with so much pain anymore.

How can I expect anyone to want to fix me if I only ever make it worse when I try?,0,the person is experiencing profound emotional distress and isolation they explicitly mention having no one left to talk to and express a deep sense of loneliness and hopelessness their narrative is filled with feelings of emptiness and a desperate longing for connection indicating a significant level of loneliness

"Never been in a relationship; Best Friend teasing me about it.Hi! This is my first post, I've been a lurker of reddit for a really long time and I was hoping to get some opinions! Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, please let me know if so! 

Let me start off by saying I'm 18 I'm a woman and I'm a virgin, I've never had an actual relationship, I struggle with anxiety, OCD and an ED, all three of which control my life, but I make a huge effort to be friendly and get out there, but at times it seems no one really wants to have anything to do with me... I keep telling myself over and over: ""I just need to get out there, to meet new people, be patient.""
But everyday I feel more and more hopeless. I just want to meet new people and make friends. 

Honestly I had managed to cope with it until recently... I have 1 really close friend, and I hang out with her friend group because I'm lucky enough she includes me, she's my best friend and her friends are nice too.. but lately it seems like all they do is make fun of me for being a virgin. laughing and joking, purposefully asking me what certain sexual acts are to test how 'innocent' I am. I may be a virgin but I'm not stupid...
I know it's just a joke but it's yet another reminder that I'm alone and inadequate, when they start discussing and bragging about sex I feel so alone, I wish I could ask them to just stop the joking but I genuinely fear the confrontation, I don't want to lose them. 

Knowing I'm a virgin makes me feel like I'm less of a woman, like I'm a child, I feel so incompetent, I feel like even if I did have a relationship it wouldn't work because I can't be comfortable with someone, hell I can't even make new friends let alone relationships...

I don't know... part of me needs to know is it possible to meet someone who id actually be comfortable enough with? I'm just so scared to actually meet someone, if in fact anyone would want to meet me... 
Should I try harder to just be more comfortable so I can try and meet people and loose my virginity..? 
I'm so conflicted and I feel awfully pathetic and small, but I'm trying to stay positive, I just honestly want to meet nice new people who I can get to know without feeling pressured and uncomfortable.

"TrustI??m not really sure if I can do this anymore. Live I mean. I need to know what you talked about with him. I need to know nothing happened. I need to know everything, so that I can properly evaluate my pain because right now it??s running on all cylinders. Even if you do tell me that nothing happened, I won??t believe you. I don??t believe anything that you say or do. How did you portray me to him? I know about the lies you told him but How terrible were the things you said about me? Am I really a bad lover ? Do you really think I don??t listen to you ? When have I been mean to you ? Never have I ever treated you the way you claim. You painted me as a villain to lure him in and it almost worked. Until I caught you. I treated you like an absolute queen. how could you do this to me? I really want to hurt myself over my newfound insecurities . You have to have at least kissed him. It wouldn??t have been so easy to say that you don??t love me and that you??ll wait for him. You must??ve. Or were you that desperate to betray and leave me. 
I??m not good enough and I know that for a fact now. I really don??t want to hurt anymore. Loving you hurts so much. And yet I push through it to see you happy. I know I said that I forgive you to help fix things but I  don??t know how to not make you less mad or upset. It seems like you always are. Sometimes you see through me or I try and speak up about how upset I am but you shut me right up with neglect and frustration as if it??s my fault that you??re uncomfortable handling the truth and the consequences of your actions. I need closure. It doesn??t matter if I get it or not anymore. At this point I??m so lost I just really want to stop existing.

"Don't know what it feels like to be lovedI think the dogs I see a lot ""love"" me but I imagine it's not the same as love from a human. If I stopped playing with them they'd probably never look at me. 22 years on this planet and not a single genuine reciprocation. I have done so much for so many people, only to have them leave just as quick as they came. It's pretty miserable to live like this. 

I see posts saying you need to learn how to be by yourself. I know how to do that, that's what I've done for the past decade at the least. I don't want to do that anymore. I've never wanted to do that. 

I wrote a suicide note a month ago but couldn't go through with it mostly due to fear of missing out. I still have a glimmer of hope that there are actually answers to my problems. I have to believe I'll actually be happy soon, because if I don't believe that I'll be dead.

I find her so cool and I see we have a few common interests but I have some sort of social anxiety/phobia which makes talk in a dumb way and most probably puts her off.

All my past relationships I've been told I'll find better. But the truth was I only wanted someone to stay, to be with me when I needed them most. At first I would blame myself, but thinking back I never did wrong. I always placed them above myself and here I am watching them grow happy after being used.

I've always felt sad, apparently I even wanted to drown myself when I was like 7, I still wouldn't say I'm depressed tho because I have a lot of good moments. But I think about 2 years ago I fell for this girl, I'm gonna be calling her deodorant as I don't wanna use an actual name. I literally became obsessed with her. I ended up becoming friends with her and eventually my other friends pushed me to tell her how I felt. She didn't feel the same way, about a year goes by and I steel have the same feelings for her and I end up finding out she did like me back but she lied because she was scared she would hurt me, this ended up making me very sad and confused for a while and another year later I met this other girl online, fell in love and we became a thing. Even though she lived in a different country and we'd never met in person everything seemed perfect, but sometimes I'd get these feelings for doedorant coming back as I'm still friends with her and I'm not one to let go of people i care about. My gf ends up breaking up with me and since I knew my best friend was on a date and I didn't wanna ruin it for him I turned to deodorant and she has really helped me get through everything including several anxiety attacks extremely well, sadly this also rekindled my feelings for her and it consumed me as I didn't know what to do because I didn't wanna ruin our friendship, after keeping it in for a while I told her and got the answer I expected. now I just feel like I can't or maybe even don't deserve to be loved.

"Have you everbeen to the point where you??re going through the motions, as if you??re someone else. I??m not sure where this belongs maybe here because I??m feeling lonely, maybe no one reads it and it??s at the bottom of the barrel. I??ve always been an outgoing, socialist person, never questioned who was around me so long as we got along, never cared for what you looked like, as long as we had a level of real in between, I hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend, job to job, always searching a piece of happiness, going around lost searching for some unknown answer. Everyone around me seems to be on a level of something I can??t obtain, sure I own a business, my daughter now lives with me, but I am not happy. Or some days I am, the most part is I find myself getting up on the weekend really early and just driving, I??ve driven two states non stop just on the road feeling everything. One time I drove 350 miles to catch the ocean, just myself and tunes I could sing and relate to. I deleted all my ??social?? media awhile ago, Facebook and Instagram and whatever else I had, then about a few weeks later I realized no one checked up on me, not one call or text, I figured ??don??t ask questions you don??t want the answer to??, because I knew right away no one would. But some part of me hoped someone would. I walked into a life again, with a seldom and sobering feeling that this ??feeling?? I??m feeling, whatever you want to describe it as, was sentimental. I find myself beginning to love who I am, and damn it be a lonely Ss road, but worth it. I find myself carrying myself, telling myself I??m worth it, I??m this and that. I??m enough for anyone. It no one sees then I know I got me. Gods got my back. For those who are just down right lonely, searching, wondering, you got everything you will ever need inside of you. I know depression hurts, men and women, i know heartache and finical problems drain your souls. I know it all hurts, there??s a million people just like us, and a million more that are going through a lot more too. We??re all family, we just forgot how to love. Maybe that??s what we all need to become is the love we want to see. I hope you all are feeling better today or someday, I really do

But they also haven't seen the signs and haven't spoken to me since I cut my abusive mother's out of my life.

"Zero friends (18f)Well. I'll jump into it. I moved around to about 5 different highschools and 3 elementary schools throughout grades 7-12. The first few times I was always looking to make friends, it also helped that I was still younger. But after moving a million more times and into cities where the people were much less friendly I gave up and would always just be on my own. Grades 11 and 12 I would eat lunch by myself everyday, never knowing what to do and often just sitting on the stairs on my phone or something. I'm a 5'11 female and due to my quietness people usually think I'm either intimidating or weird. I have major social anxiety and anxiety in general so that probably doesn't help. I don't get along with my family. And I don't really have aunts or uncles or grandparents who we don't have a restraining order against or who aren't dead. I graduated alone. Watching everyone else with their friend groups taking group pics was horrible. Never went to any parties. Don't even remember the last time I went to a birthday party or a stay the night type thing. I'm an introvert as well, so my routines from day to day are basically the same. I have a job, but it's at a dealership and I'm literally the youngest and only female in the shop so I can't really make friends in there other than having friendly coworker conversations with the 28 year old+ guys. I've tried stupid things like those apps for making friends but I can never get past the talking stage and I'd rather meet someone in person.

I used to send her handmade bday cards too, and even she made a handmade card for me. We were talking normally about two weeks back ......and that's it. For some reason she is just ignoring me like anything. Nothing even happened. She is just not responding anymore. And how ik that she's there but just ignoring me is because I can still see her posting statuses. And this is just one example, I've faced this exact scenario with 1-2 people more, one was very recent, in which I was talking to a person on here and we were getting along so well, and then she just stopped msging....just like that,fir days. I'm never atleast given an explanation as to if I did anything wrong, I'm just left their wondering what did I do? Ik that I wasn't rude or hurtful, one thing ik about me for sure is I always put others above myself and listen to them, try to make them laugh etc. So it srsly hurts when I have no idea and am just figuring out if I'm a piece of shit that no one wants to talk to. I've never really had close frnds, always kinda been lonely and alone, and especially in current lockdown, stuff like this definitely doesn't help. Well, maybe I just overthink a lot because I have a low self esteem, or there is something wrong with me.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of loneliness and isolation. the person describes multiple instances of being ignored by friends, which exacerbates their sense of being alone. they mention having never really had close friends and feeling particularly lonely during the lockdown. these experiences and feelings strongly suggest that the person is indeed lonely."
"What else can I say.I don't know if that has any relation to the issues going on in America. I live in Japan teaching English with a passion in film and writing. I commit to them everyday. I've had a good few weeks adjusting to my new lifestyle, and I had to think about what is going on in America today in between my classes. I am quite disgusted with the issues of racism. I talked to my father on the phone and told him that I wish I can do something about it but I can't. My stories will never change the state of the world and make it better. I put a lot of my anger and hatred into my stories. It gives me a certain amount of meaning for myself and it fights my loneliness here in Japan. He told me you don't know that and I asked him did Hayao Miyazaki destroy racism with his stories? He didn't. Miyazaki said you should try to change the world even if it doesn't. He is right. You can't change anything. Forgive my rambling. I had to let this out and don't know where else to post this. I am not a political person so I would rather not talk about this in some politics subreddit. I don't think my voice and everyone's voice will change anything.",0,"the narrative shows clear signs of loneliness. the person expresses feelings of isolation in japan, and the mention of using stories to fight their loneliness further supports this. they also indicate a lack of meaningful connection, feeling that their voice won't make a difference. the label should reflect this loneliness."
"I can do itI am a lucky person and I can become the person that I want to be. I can do this. Right now, it is just the middle stage. I can do this.",0,"the narrative shows a positive and determined mindset, indicating self-belief and motivation. there are no signs of loneliness or isolation, as the person expresses confidence in their ability to achieve their goals."
"Play videos to drown out Stark quiet homeSo I'm 22 and I live alone, and I can't tell if im addicted to YouTube or I'm just constantly in need of content playing to drown out the Stark quietness of living alone. It's actually bad I need it while I pee, brush my teeth, in the shower, right before I sleep, when I was the dishes. Any waking moment I'm playing a show or a podcast. Anyone else like this?",0,the person is clearly experiencing loneliness as they constantly need to drown out the silence of living alone with videos and podcasts this behavior indicates a struggle with solitude and a desire for some form of company or distraction
Lonely?! Cum see me ????????[removed],0,"the narrative uses a sarcastic tone and invites others to come see them, indicating they are reaching out for social interaction rather than expressing genuine loneliness"
Lonely everywhere.[deleted],0,the person describes feeling lonely everywhere which clearly indicates a sense of pervasive loneliness this contradicts the provided label so it appears there is a mismatch between the narrative and the label
You know you??re a loner when all it takes is for someone to text you once on snapchat to be your ??best friend.??It??s kind of funny when I think about it. And I texted this person a week ago.,0,"the label is incorrect because the narrative clearly describes behaviors and feelings indicative of loneliness, such as forming a strong attachment from minimal social interaction and reflecting on this with a sense of humor that masks underlying isolation."
My best friend blocked meMy best friend and one of my only friends just blocked me on all social media. I so fcking bad right now I dont know what to do... I dont want to continue living without her in my life...,0,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing intense emotional distress due to being blocked by their best and possibly only friend on social media. this indicates feelings of loneliness and abandonment, which suggests the person is struggling with social isolation."
"It's impossible to not feel like a monster when you're a virgin.When sex is one of the most human and universal experiences that people have, it really makes me feel like a monster that I didn't lose my virginity at a socially acceptable age. What really gets me is that I could've prevented ending up like this if I was just a better person when I was younger. I have no one else to blame but myself for this shit. I genuinely don't feel like a human being, how can I say I'm a person worthy of being alive and being loved when I can't even form these intimate connections with others. I'm so depressed and alone and I know that no amount of going to the gym or working hard in medical school will ever fix what's wrong with me.

I'm tired of people telling me being a virgin isn't worth being suicidal over, and I'm tired of people saying I have a mental illness and need help. Anybody would feel the same way if they were put in my shoes. Human beings are not meant to be alone this long, and I know I've probably suffered permanent brain damage and developmental abnormalities from being like this. I absolutely hate my life and no amount of self-acceptance will ever change that. I will never accept that I can be happy being this way when it was my fault I ended up like this. I will carry this pain for the rest of my life, and that genuinely makes me not want to go on anymore.",0,"the person expresses deep feelings of loneliness, isolation, and self-blame. they struggle with their self-worth due to their virginity and perceive it as a significant failure. they feel disconnected from others and believe that their situation has caused irreversible damage to their mental and emotional well-being. they express hopelessness and a lack of belief in self-acceptance or improvement."
"Why me? Why me out of everyone?I was friends with this girl, i fell in love with her...and the rest is the same corny story...i was too nervous to confess but last night i decided to do it. I confessed and she confessed she liked me too. I was the happiest i could be this morning. Then i told my friend about this, and turns out he was interested in her too. I was confused, didnt know what to do. I couldve chosen not to tell her about him but something about it didnt feel right. I told her about him and they talked(they knew each other for very long). They talked and she decided that she liked him more than me. She said that she still wanted to be friends with me but i just couldnt stay there. I ran, i ran home i cried and cried for hours. Now i feel dead inside. I just have one question, why did this happen to me? ive been single for 19 years, this was my first time opening up to a girl and this happened. Am i meant to be alone? Should i just give up?",0,"the narrative clearly shows feelings of rejection and emotional pain but it also shows that the person has social connections such as friends and has had meaningful interactions with others. while they are experiencing a moment of intense loneliness due to the romantic rejection, they are not fundamentally isolated or lacking social support which suggests they are not chronically lonely."
"Love. Should I even bother to look? Perhaps I am too broken to have it again?Is it wrong for me to want to find love again? It doesn't feel fair to anybody for me to try. My heart still aches from shit that happened a decade ago now. Who the fuck wants to be with somebody with that kind if baggage? To be in love with somebody who I haven't seen or spoke to in years and who more than likely will never wish to talk to me again. 

I fear any potential partner I'm with will be scared away as soon as I talk about my past and I don't think would be fair to hide it from them any woman I could possibly be with I feel deserves to know that shit so they can decide if they want any part of it or not most likely not I would assume. 

Will my feelings of love for her fade away If I could fall for somebody else? I don't think it's fair otherwise? To be in love with two people at the same time? I don't think so.",0,"the narrative reveals deep emotional turmoil and a sense of unworthiness related to past relationships. the person expresses doubts about finding love again and fears rejection due to their emotional baggage. they also seem to be holding onto feelings for someone from their past, which further complicates their ability to move on. these feelings and thoughts suggest a profound sense of loneliness and isolation."
"Partner laughed at the idea Hired Bridesmaids even though I would need that as I gave no friends.The other night I was scrolling through Instagram and an Instagram reel started playing a stupid song. He asked what I was watching, so I told him it was some silly video about hired bridesmaids. He proceeded to laugh and say ""who the heck would need that? That's just sad."" 
But I would need that. I have not a single friend and therefore I wouldn't have bridesmaids if we got married. His words struck me right in the heart as all I could think of is how he would view me as a sad person for needing that service. Add that into the fact I was already thinking I would need to rent a friend for social times (cause I haven't had a friend in 10 years) and it just left me broken. 
I told him how I felt and he did apologise. But I still can't stop thinking about it and how I'm one of those ""sad"" lovely souls who just want a friend for once.",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of deep loneliness and isolation. the individual mentions having no friends, considering hiring bridesmaids, and feeling broken after their partner's insensitive remark. the narrative also highlights a lack of social connections for the past ten years, indicating significant loneliness. therefore, the classification should reflect the presence of loneliness."

"Need some advice on what I feel is a one sided friendshipI made two close friends in my first year of university, we all stayed in the same residence building. When universities in Canada announced online classes for the rest of the semester in March this year, myself and another friend returned home while one remained in the country. I returned to Kenya and my other friend returned home to Germany. At first things were ok, it was nice to be back home and we kept in touch frequently by gaming together or just video calling each other. Over time however it slowly progressed to a point where I would reach out to them and would get a response a couple of days later. This would make me feel a bit upset but I understood that they're probably occupied with other things. When it was my birthday the friend in Canada forgot about it, which bummed me out quite a bit. 

At the moment it's now reached a point where they either don't respond or acknowledge my messages. I'll get a random snap of the floor or sky every now and then but it's as though any effort I've made to strike up a conversation has gone unnoticed and fallen on deaf ears. I would really appreciate some advice on what exactly to do about this, I tried bringing it up with them but they mentioned that they have been busy at home and don't check Instagram. I then asked if whatsapp would be better to which they said yes, but there was no difference. I don't know why things are like this, from a point where we considered each other family to a point where I feel like I'm being treated as a complete stranger. The signals are very mixed, and I don't know whether I should try and confront them about it or just move on. I can't exactly make friends here in Kenya and they will be returning to online studying in Canada. I'm worried that missing a semester of being there will create a further rift and I'll have to completely start over with making new friends. My apologies for such a long rant, I would appreciate some advice on what to do.

TL;DR: my friends have been extremely unresponsive during the whole lockdown, I'm constantly the one taking the initiative to reach out and they are not responding at all, what should I do?",0,the person is not lonely because they have had close friendships in the past and are actively seeking advice on how to mend these relationships. their concern is specific to the current situation of unresponsiveness from friends due to the lockdown and geographical distance. they are showing a proactive approach to solving their social issues and are not isolated from social interactions entirely.

"Poem about Lonliness and MusicI have no clue if this is the right place to put this, but I wanted to semi-vent through poetry. Here goes.

A cymbal, then a crash.

Who would've known?

This music is like a drug, a stash. 

Healing, it brings me out of the darkness.

Without it, there would be no light. No brightness.

"If you feel lonely , it doesn't mean that no body likes you !I always thought that no body likes me that's why i don't have friends , but i relaised that many people likes me and maybe the problem is i can't develop a friendship or i just didn't meet people with similar interests !",0,the narrative describes someone who initially felt lonely but later realized that many people actually like them. this indicates that the person is not lonely because they have recognized the presence of people who care about them and understand that the issue might be their ability to form friendships or find people with similar interests.
