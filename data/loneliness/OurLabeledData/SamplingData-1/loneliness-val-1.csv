Like over aware of my body and this strange, ??so this reality of life is weird, living is expensive, I??m just this weird creature doing things all day??. I don??t know, I??m having trouble explaining it. I just feel strange and alone. I often feel like crying. 

I??m still getting over my breakup. I miss being close with someone, but at the same time I have no interest in dating at all. I went on bumble, but didn??t even chat with any of my matches. I could have done literally anything after moving out of my old apartment, and I chose to come here.

When i was in high school i did something stupid and lots of the friends i had did not want to be associated with me anymore and then once i graduated i got a job in kitchen and then a couple of years ago they closed where i worked and decided to go to college and my only friends are my gf and kevin.

Why is it that everyone??s sharing sage lvl knowledge, on every platform there is, but I still can??t get over people that walk in and out of my life? 

I know I??m young. I know how much I??ve grown from what I was to become what I am now. I know what else I need to achieve to live my dreams in my future reality. And I know I shouldn??t compare my growth to others.. I know. 
But I can??t help it. 

And no matter what I do, how busy I am, how much progress I make.. there??s always that underlying feeling of I haven??t done enough, the need to share my day with someone that is ??my person??

"My story I guess haha...Hi my name is Aiko and I'm lonely asf

Ig it all started when I moved to another city. Lost all my friends and had to make new ones. Not a big deal right? Well the 2 years I lived there I couldn't make one single friend, ig I was too ""different"". That's what I've been telling myself for a long time. We moved again, I had high hopes this time. But no change haha. Everything just got worse. 
Yk I always tought I was the weird one, but at that time it felt like everyone else was weird. I was nice, pretty funny, a good listener, I tought of myself as the perfect friend. I put so much effort into making friends. I was always gave my all to someone but they never gave something back. I mean that's what relationships are about right? Giving and taking. You cant just give and give without receiving. Itll make you feel worn out after a while. Ig that happened to me. After a while I just stopped trying. And now everyone is leaving cuz I ""changed"". Well they've already left haha. I've been alone for 2 years now. Well not ""alone"". I have my mom and sister who care alot about me. But it sucks seeing other kids my age having fun with eachother while I'm sitting at home every day doing nothin but laying in my bed. Maybe I'll make a friend some day, maybe it's just not my time yet yk. All I want is one good friend, is that possible? If you read this all thank you, I appreciate it. Why you may ask? Cuz you've basically just listened to my story, something alot of people didnt want to hear.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to their repeated inability to form and maintain friendships despite their efforts. they describe a sense of isolation and feeling different from others, leading to a lack of meaningful social connections. despite having family members who care about them, they feel left out when they see peers enjoying social interactions, highlighting their deep sense of loneliness."
"I hate being lonely but I accept it either wayI know my friends aren't always Available but I don't know it just feels like they don't want to talk to me. I guess it is annoying being texted ""how was your day"" everyday but I just want to know how they are because I want them to feel cared for even though I'm always the one to text first. I just wish I was they're first option I do hang out with them at school everyday before quarantine and it was just the 3 of us but now. The longer this quarantine is the dryer the conversation is, it's like it doesn't really matter whether I text or not but once I don't text for a week all of a sudden they are worried. So I text back saying I couldn't find my charger or something.

I wish I could tell them how bad me day was, or why I was crying, or why I don't respond to their text for a few weeks because I didn't want to bother them. I hate when people worry about me because anything they say or do to help never works but I appreciate it. I occasionally harm my self but I'm ashamed of what they will think. What happens to me isn't in their control and I don't want them to feel like they can't help me because they don't understand the situation. So I try my best to put a smile on my face, and to put a smile on them too.

I used to feel good about myself for last 1 and a half years but for the last one Month I'm missing that feeling. I have been feeling way more lonely nowadays and I cry my heart out when I can't hold it in. I have been judging myself a lot recently and I think I need to stop. Like I judge myself on how I look, how I talk, how's my social status etc. And it makes me feel bad everytime. 

I'm trying hard to change some of the things I don't like about myself, but I don't like the feeling of judging myself on every damn thing.

I'm 20 and have been single for my whole life and I'm really craving some strong Feminine And Romantic Feeling in the life for some time now. I just got a Panic Attack Craving this.

"my (partial) day / check-inwake up after a nightmare.  slightly sweaty.  what class was next on my schedule?  what subject?  who is my teacher?  (i've been out of school for a long time, i'm 46.)  my last relationship pops into my head.  aloneness.  unrequited love.  loss.  a sinking and spiraling feeling of pain.  it doesn't go away.  brain fog.  make coffee.  watch women's speed chess championship on twitch.  a family walks down the street to the levee.  laughter.  eat leftover chicken from last night, cold.  play chess (badly) on chess dot com.  i've lost  interest in all my previous hobbies.  emptiness.  browse tinder, hinge, bumble and okcupid.

it's 3:19pm PT on a saturday, in june, and i have no reason to feel empty and alone.

"I??ve never felt so aloneI??ve always been shy, which eventually turned into being scared to even socialize when I got older. I??ve had the same group of friends throughout high school. People knew me ofc, but now that I look back on it, besides that friend group, it??s always been just acquaintances. I don??t consider them my friends now.

I??m in my second year of college and well you guessed it, I made no friends last year and well with covid, it??s hard to do it this semester. Few of my high school friends go to the same college as I do actually. But they can actually socialize and aren??t afraid to make plans or reach out. They both have made new friends and I occasionally talk to them but I don??t want to intrude their new life; they??ve reached out to me once last year actually, but when I was hanging out, I felt like an outcast. I obviously didn??t have the same chemistry with these new friends and I was too scared to talk. 

So yea, because of my dumb ass, I??m here being lonelier than I??ve ever been before. I feel like the only solid person I have in my life is an online friend I met on minecraft 7 years ago lol. He??s been the person I spill everything to, but the actual irl connection is missing and it does suck cause that??s all I??ve ever wished for in my life: to have that one friend who would actually think about me.

I even debated getting therapy because well I am depressed but I don??t want to say it??s depression cause I??m not officially diagnosed, but I do self-harm occasionally. My sister told me I??m basically paying $150+ to have a friend or someone to talk to, and that just made feel like in another life, I wish I wasn??t this socially awkward and scared and that I could save my money by actually having a friend to talk to ????",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of loneliness and isolation. the individual describes a long history of social anxiety and difficulty forming meaningful connections. they have lost touch with their high school friends and struggle to make new ones in college, especially due to the impact of covid. their only close connection is an online friend, which lacks the in-person interaction they crave. they express a desire for therapy to address their depression and self-harm, highlighting their need for someone to talk to. this all points to a significant sense of loneliness."
No ones got time or no one wants to see me?I have 2 friends in real life one of them is able to see me only during the weekends for a couple of hours and other one is very busy so I only see her during school.

I am trying to find new people I started new hobbies but everyone there is 5+ years older than me so I feel lost. Am I expecting too much or what? Who is at fault here?

I know that I am introverted and I came to realize by posting around that I have social anxiety.

Then I take a look at myself, I only made 2 friends in 5 years... (one of them even moved to another town) I feel like a freak, I think to myself ""If people having big friend groups are normal, then I am a martian or something else like that"" As expected, I never had a girlfriend as well...

I've never really had a girlfriend and it's never really bothered me until recently when I felt the loneliness hit me like truck.

"New here - Old everywhereI don't really know where to start. I've been everywhere and never fit anywhere. From coast to coast in North America I've never done anything right to fit in. I'm loud and certainly annoying. I don't really try to make people like me, I just act like myself and generally fit in at first. it takes about three to four days solid with me and no one likes me. I've got some head issues I'm very open about that people still don't seem to understand. I'm in love. Again. But someone different that's better than the rest like everyone else that's better than someone different. I don't even believe in that shit. I just don't want to be alone and I manifest it. At least that's what I think I do. It doesn't change the fact that I feel it regardless of whether I believe in it or not. Which is probably what makes it so painful when it all comes crashing down like it is currently. Again. I don't like any of my friends. They don't like me either. I've learned that everyone I know that acts like they like me really just thinks that I'll fuck them eventually because I'm pretty pathetic and not the most horrible thing to look at. It's been a hard realization but couldn't have come at a more perfect time since I can't hang out with anyone anyway with C19 going around. I don't really know what I'm going to do now. I don't want to integrate back into society and I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be in love with a guy that I know doesn't love me but I can't stop daydreaming about having someone. I don't think anyone wants to be alone and a lot of us probably don't know what it's like to have anybody anyway. I just don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to be alone and it sucks because everyone always tells me how great I am before they spent much time with me. So how do I be great all the time? And not get old to someone immediately? How do I be myself and not too much at the same time? It's one of those I want to blame everyone else but I know it's me things. And I don't know how to change who I actually am. And I know that everyone says you should be yourself and people will love you for that but can't love you if you're not, but people can't love me for what I am. Not for long anyway. And I really just can't fathom living forever this way. Like maybe I should start making friends online and not real life? Maybe distance between me and others would make it easier to accept me? It's the human touch thing that I'm afraid to lose. The hope thing has been gone a long time. The needy thing will probably last forever.",1,"the person expresses feelings of isolation and a lack of belonging, indicating a deep sense of loneliness. they mention that they do not fit in anywhere and have difficulty maintaining relationships. their awareness of being perceived negatively by others and the desire for connection further highlights their loneliness."
"Bored and Lonely:(So I recently (about a year ago) I moved to a new country. Since I had loads of friends where I was before. I expected to atleast make a couple here. But due to my extreme awkwardness and shyness, I haven't made a single one. Yup, not even one. Just as I was beginning to connect with a couple people, school shut down. I've now gone over 4 months without having a proper conversation with anybody(excluding texts and a couple zoom calls from old friends.) 

Now that everything is opening up, I feel super alone, with nobody to meet but no excuse to stay in all the time. I feel like I'm living the same day over and over, lonely and bored. There isn't much to this post, except a stupid rant. But hey, maybe someone can relate.....",1,"the person feels isolated after moving to a new country and struggling to make friends due to shyness and awkwardness. the shutdown of their school further limited their social interactions, leading to months without proper conversations. even with things opening up, they still feel super alone and bored, living the same day repeatedly."
"Just another person in a sea of loneliness.24M With Asperger??s and I have been dealt a very shitty hand in life. Most of the time I have been rejected by groups, so I have learned to just keep to myself a lot. I was at a social event today and everyone was boasting about how they are in xyz group. Meanwhile I??m just out here barely making it by. 

I have a core group of irl friends but due to some recent events which made me the reoccurring character in my own life story, i was left out of events. This is very ironic and sad as the whole basis of that core group of friends being built was because we were all outcasts. Needless to say I have cut many of them out of my life. 

There are like a hand full of people internet friends I keep in touch with but that is just about it. I never get the help from my psychologist as she just says to do the same thing despite me doing everything and returning empty handed. 

I tried my luck in a different denomination of Christianity hoping for more and while I got more out of it, the backlash from my family was just too much to handle so for now, I have returned to my birth religion. It sucks as I actually liked the new denomination I joined and I could never find wrong doing with it. I just feel like I should have never questioned things to begin with and I wouldn??t have the problems I am having with religion as it hurts to leave the new denomination that I converted to and still subconsciously practice the denomination despite never being born into it but I had recent ancestors who were apart of it.",1,"the person feels isolated and disconnected from social groups and events. they have experienced rejection and exclusion, even from a core group of friends who were initially bonded by being outcasts. they also mention having only a few internet friends and feeling unsupported by their psychologist. their struggles with religious identity and family backlash further contribute to their sense of loneliness."
"Guess it's too lateI'm in my mid-20s. Never been in a relationship before. Never even been complimented tbh. The older I get, and the more time that passes without my life improving in any meaningful way, the less likely it is that it will ever get better. I'll get even uglier as I age, and being in my 30s or 40s with no experience will drive most people away anyway.

I feel like no one is attracted to me. I haven??t kissed anyone at all and all I see around me are people in relationships. I??m not too hopeful about my future either. Honestly, I think I??m going to be alone for the rest of my life. I haven??t had anyone as a girlfriend thus far and that??s probably foreshadowing things to come. If I don??t have a girlfriend now, if no one is attracted to me now, that seems like a sign that I??m going to be alone forever, if we??re following patterns.

I??m worried that I??m too overbearing and that people just simply don??t like hanging out with me for things about my personality that I??m not noticing.

The funny thing is I'm scared to approach and talk deeply to people so I never get to find out who the emotionally and mentally unstable or ill (not in a psychotic way) are .

"romantically lonely / desperate bc covid-19, no idea what to doSo, I was thinking a lot today about confidence. One quote I read was, see yourself the way someone who admires you sees you. But then I thought about it and realized?? None of my friends really look up to me. I??m behind everyone career-wise, and my life is kind of a mess ?? between family tensions, shit mental health, and impulsive/reckless habits. I think they all look down on me or at best, feel sorry for me. The truth is I honestly wonder if I see myself better than I think they see me.

I??ve never been one to be considered romantically ??desperate?? but here I am in the early hours of the morning wanting to start a conversation with one of the thirsty boys I play video games with who called me hot just because I have a female avatar. I guess I??d just rather talk to people who don??t already know me. But I feel really sad, sitting here waiting on strangers to talk to me.

Remember even if you have a group of people that are your ??friends?? doesn??t mean that you have supports. Sometimes people don??t resonate on the same level as you or care about what you??re going through. All there is is emptiness and no substance in relationships you have with people.

"Nothing to ShowI have nothing to show for my life so far. Well, next to nothing. Nothing that matters to me. I feel like I don??t exist anymore, and the want(need?) for attention makes me feel like an attention whore child that needs other people to get along in life. I hate going to class and not existing. I have moved around my entire life, and while I have a few good friends, they have either moved away, I have moved away, or I have had fallouts with them, which is my current situation. 

I feel sick to myself when I feel a huge dopamine rush when someone asks me to do something for them, like picking up their pencil or letting them borrow a phone charger, I immediately feel bad after I realize that conversation will most likely never go past the few words that someone directs towards me asking for something.

I hate being a little bitch. I don??t want to admit that I feel upset or depressed, but it??s so hard to shake the feeling when I get home from a long day at school, where I accomplished nothing, because I am bad at studying and procrastinate. They say people who grew up trying wish they had fun, and people that grew up having fun wish they tried. I have done neither. I graduate high school in a few months (maybe), and I have no one. Nothing. I have plans, and I will move on eventually, I will force myself to if I have to, but I still hate it. I hate being here. 

If that isn??t bad enough, I actually have had special people in my life, but I would fuck up her life or she would fuck up mine, the problem is, both of these times I have been the cause, or I have been able to prevent it. 

I don??t actually think I??m horribly hideous or have a bad personality, I mean I??m negative as you can see by the post above, but I try to care about things that matter. My parents, my little sibling are the only light in my life. I enjoy making and listening to music to ease up the burdens of life, but this only makes things worse. If I knew I had absolutely nothing to offer, I would just off myself and be done with it, but I still feel like I have something worth having, I don??t know what but I??m TRYING at least to move forward and accomplish. 

Honestly I have thought that after I??m out of the house I should just get some alcohol, drugs, and hookers, because I have pretty much given up on people. I care dearly about them, much too dearly, but they do not care about me. I know this is just life, but for whatever reason it is the hardest thing for me to process.

"I just want to feel loved manEveryone says you shouldn??t be looking for love until you love yourself. I??ve never been romantically loved, or even asked out. But maybe I just need somebody other than myself. I??ve learned to love myself. It??s taken years but I did it. So why don??t my parents call me? And when I call them why do they rush to hang up? Nobody in my family enjoys my company, because I don??t like being the brunt of every joke they make. After I told my sister I was gay she said she ??better not leave me alone with the kids anymore haha??. And it??s just constant, none of my siblings think I??m capable of talking about anything other than my dating life. And my friends, they probably wouldn??t notice if I dropped dead for at least a week, even though I live with them.

I am currently a 22 year old college junior and I am yet to make a single true friend, and I??m fucking tired of it all, and it??s killing me inside.

I look around and all I see is a glamorous lifestyle of friends, meaning, and love constantly being advertised to me, but I will never get to enjoy any of it. I??m not hanging out with anyone on weekends, I don??t get texts from people, and I will never go out with anyone. 

As for my major: I fucking hate it. Nothing interests me about it at all. It??s political science but none of it is fun whatsoever. 

I am an NPC in my own life with no backstory, no life goals, no aspirations, and absolutely no friends.

"losing my motivation again... m21Hello people of Reddit, I??m not really sure what I hope to get out of this because it??s just going to be a rant on how I??m feeling but oh well here we go. 

This shouldn??t come as a shock to anyone reading this but I am very lonely. I just recently turned 21 and I have never been in a relationship before. I never went on a single date in high school and didn??t have my first kiss until college, which I??ll be graduating in May. 

I??ve got pretty low self esteem and self confidence because I got bullied in middle school and high school. I??ll give you all en example: freshman year of high school I was playing GTA5 with some friends on Xbox. I went to go eat dinner and left my mic on mute, when I came back I forgot it was on mute and I heard them talking about me. They were talking about a picture someone had taken of me earlier that day and they said I looked ??ugly and inhuman.?? To this day I really don??t like having my picture taken. 

Now I look better than I did in middle school / high school for sure but I still struggle with my appearance a lot. I??ve tried using dating apps because it??s hard for me to approach girls in person but they??ve really only made things worse. I??ve used a combination of 4 dating apps over the past 4 years and I??ve averaged 1-2 matches a month. That??s with swiping right on over 200 people/day until I ran out of people in my area and eventually made new accounts to try again. Meanwhile my friends with the same dating apps will have 70+ matches and have 99+ people liking them. All of my friends and family say that I am smart, funny, witty, and have a good personality so it doesn??t take a genius to figure out why nobody is liking me. 

As I mentioned before, I recently turned 21. I??m a senior in college so obviously I??ve been drinking before but I don??t enjoy it so turning 21 wasn??t a huge milestone for me. I did however want to do something with my friends though. I mentioned my birthday coming up for months and when it came down to it nobody hit me up to do anything. Even my own roommates ended up leaving me alone in the apartment to go watch a basketball game. I ended up eating dinner at the university cafeteria after my last class and bought myself a pie on the way home. It was probably my least favorite birthday. 

The combination of my birthday on Tuesday and what happened with my last match on bumble has really started to bum me out again. We matched on birthday funny enough and ended up talking for the next three days. I honestly don??t think I??ve ever connected with someone so well and I was genuinely excited every time I would get a notification from her. Everything ended abruptly when she found out I had some conservative views and she doesn??t associate with people like that. I was really taken back by it and I still find it hard to believe people take politics so seriously. I??m not even a die-hard far right conservative, I??m more towards the middle. Anyway it was just the icing on the cake and I??ve deleted all my dating profile accounts now. 

This is turning into a long read but if you??ve made it this far then props to you buddy. Anyway I can feel myself starting to slip back into a pretty depressed state and it scares me. All my life I??ve gone through what I call periods of feeling good and feeling pretty depressed. I??m not the ??I have self diagnosed depression please give me attention type.?? I very rarely will talk with my friends or family about how I??m feeling because I genuinely don??t think they care and I feel it would be pointless which is why I found myself here to rant. But going back, when I??m feeling depressed all I can think about is how my life has gone so far. That ranges from things people have said about me over the years which keep me up at night to never having been in a relationship before. I??m 21 years old now, if I live to be 100 that??s a fifth of my life already over and I feel it was all meaningless. I??ve come pretty close to killing myself three times in the past and I??ll probably end up going through with it once I graduate college. 

The first time was in my junior year of college. My sister was taking pictures of me at home and I don??t remember why but it was genuinely upsetting me. I tried getting her phone so that I could delete them but she locked herself in her room. My mom came into the hallway to see what was going on and I ended up punching a hole in the wall. My mom screamed and the look of disappoint on her face really hit me because I love my mom. I ended up fixing the hole in the wall but I felt like such a disappointment to my mom and I didn??t have anything else going for me I just wanted to kill myself. I heavily thought it over so the following months but ended up not going through with it. I??m also not a very angry person, the outburst was really uncharacteristic of me and in the last 5.5-6 years nothing like that has ever happened again. 

The second time was after I graduated high school. I got accepted to a university out of state and I decided that??s where I wanted to go. I wanted to get away from all the negativity I associate home with (except my family) but I was afraid that everything would be the same. I was going to shoot myself at the end of the summer but a couple of friends of mine noticed I wasn??t really myself and had a mini intervention for me. I brushed it off but it did convince me to do to college. 

The third time I don??t have a story like the last two. I just happened to be going through a really bad period and it just didn??t seem worth it anymore. 

I am so lonely and just want someone to spend my life with. I want to hold hands, go on dates, or just do something simple like go grocery shopping together. It??s so hard watching my friends go in and out of being in relationships over the years. Two of my best friends are now even in long term relationships where they live with their girlfriends. I??m at a weird age in my life where I??ve got friends who are in long term relationships, friend who are still new to their relationships, friends who talk about just hooking up with girls, and then there is me who does none of that. I??m not even interested in one night stands but I??m sure it would be nice to have a connection for even that short period of time. 

I don??t have the motivation to care about anything anymore. I??ve got a 3.5 GPA and my grades mean nothing to me now. I have a nice car and with my degree I??ll be making close to 6 figures right out of college but the money doesn??t mean anything to me. I just want to be happy. I said before I??ll probably wait until after college to off myself and that??s because I at least want to get my degree to make my mom and dad proud. They both weren??t fortunate enough to go through college so I know it would mean a lot to them. 

I don??t think I covered this before but I??m not a super loner with no friends, in fact I don??t really have a problem making friends at all. I know my friends seem kinda shitty for leaving me alone in my birthday but they??re not bad people and I don??t hold it against them. My friends form back home wished me happy birthday and so did my ones here. And no, I??m not still friends with the two who bullied me in high school from my story before.

My mood changes like the weather. I haven't contributed anything ""special"" to society. I'm a waste of space and I hate myself so much. Sometimes I want to die but I'm afraid of dying.

"cycle of self-loathingI am facing an issue in life, and I can't seem to escape it. It's a cycle. I hate myself for it. Everyone on this sub has fantasized about not being lonely one way or another. when I do that, the cycle begins. I get a glimmer of hope for myself and my future. the deeper I choose to think about it, the sadder I seem to get. so what am I to do but play video games. alone. Being alone reminds me that I am lonely. So after a while, I stop and reflect on life. Usually I do this while listening to music. I am a fan of japanese music, and lately I've noticed that I listen to the songs ""Choose Me"" and ""Don't you tell ME"" (both of which are love songs) on repeat for extended periods of time. Typically, after about an hour of life's reflection, I find some sort of happiness or satisfaction. Then the cycle waits to begin again.",1,the person describes a repetitive cycle of self-loathing and loneliness they engage in solitary activities like playing video games and reflecting on life which reinforces their sense of isolation their focus on love songs also indicates a longing for connection and companionship
"Goodbye to you all (even tho this won??t be seen or read by anyone)To the entire W family, I hope you all will be able to move on as usual. I never really had a connection with any of you. Interaction with you all, came across to seem as if you all have bitter and resentful feelings towards me, even though I don??t feel that way about any of you.

To my immediate family, this will probably end up impacting you two the most out of everyone. You two are most likely going to be the only ones who??s aware of my exiting. I??m sorry to my brother and my mother, I can??t live just for the sake of family, when the world that??s not related to me doesn??t want anything to do with me.

To my last few friends 
B, G, N, N, E, C, C
Thank you for bringing joyful moments in my life.  I??m glad that none of you will be impacted by my exiting, never knowing due to having no one to inform anyone of you. None of you have contact with my family, the only people who??d be aware. Due to none of my friends and the majority of the younger generation not reading the newspaper, there won??t be a source to inform of my passing. I hope you all can proceed as usual like nothing happened. I will leave this world without others being aware of it. To both N &amp; C, I hope your guys wedding goes well, as well with you N, I hope your wedding with M goes well. 

Z,J,M,P. I??m sorry for letting you all down and I??m heartbroken I ended up getting all four of you to not want anything to do with me and not being able to bear a conversation with me. It wasn??t any of your faults for my depressed/suicidal condition of 2019 that was caused by work, school and finances. However I bottled it up and isolated myself instead of informing anyone of you of struggling even though you were the uplifting highlight of my days. I became too draining for you guys and I??m not upset with anyone of you four for walking away, I wish I could say otherwise for how I feel about myself however. Even though the four of you seem to borderline despise me and would flee the room if I was present, I still care about you guys. In my final moments and as my heart beats for the last time, I??ll be thinking of the positive memories. You guys will think of me on however you choose to think about me, I can??t change if you guys perceive my exiting as a pathetic attempt at attention in the near 0% chance any of you will be informed of my absence. I just want to  rest and end this pain which has had no minimization from medicine, hospitalization, or therapy.

With friends dwindling, living back home, financially struggling, college degree field being shut down from budget cuts. I??m left with nothing but loneliness and emptiness. Such emotional agony that causes me physical aches and pain alongside emotional. Personal hobbies are pointless when it??s constantly while alone and there??s no one to share or talk about said hobby with. 

The last loved one in my life to mention is someone who isn??t capable of reading this and that??s my dog. I love you R and it might be tough being in a new home, with me being your second home and owner. I hope you get people that??ll love you as much as I loved you and that aren??t as broken as me. Thank you for keeping me company in my last months here when others couldn??t stand my presence.

I told myself if by April things had worsened then it??ll be time to end it all and it has and it??ll clearly continue for the rest of my life. Some people aren??t meant for this world and that??s something I??ve come to terms with. I??m not scared of being gone, I??m finally ready to end my worthless misery.

"I love/hate being lonely.Honestly, I enjoy being on my own. I don't feel the need to be fake. I don't feel judged. It gives me a chance to rest for all of the socialising I have to do at school. I could probably go a week without talking to my friends (Tbh I don't feel like I fit in with them). It feels calming and I don't text any of my friends at the weekend.. (which is unusual for people my age).

But I hate the fact that I enjoy it so much. There are times where I imagine what it's like being and extroverted person, having fun with people that I enjoy being around, falling in love and well, just not being me. 
I know I let my friends down when I say no to going out with them (especially as they don't usually ask me out).

I love the watchmen comics and lots of tv shows (not really into anime though)if any of this resonates with you, I would love to give a go at being friends.

I know I should leave them but it isn't possible at the moment. I'm just emotionally drained at this point. And it isn't like I have friends to rely on. Being mentally ill sucks too.

I??ve experienced women literally walk the other direction from me when I approach at parties and such. It always has made me wonder what is wrong with me leading to uncontrollable overthinking about minuscule social interactions and constant questioning towards my appearance, personality, etc. My parents have always told me that I would find that someone who would love me forever but I??m starting to believe that the statement has no truth to it whatsoever.

Every time I type something like this I struggle to flesh things out, and I always feel like I've missed large chunks out and no one understands me; what I'm trying to say. 

I feel like a bad person, all the time. And I think that's all I have to explain why everyone hates me. 

I try so hard to be understanding, and things like that but I think I'm just too stupid to be. If anyone ever vents to me I feel stuck. I can never suggest solutions, only try to make them feel better.

Someone was annoyed at me because when I vent its always about being bullied. I never talk about my family shit.

I think that's because I view my situation as a cliche and am numb to it. I wish I could feel this way about how people treat me. 

I don't think anyone will be interested in me romantically. Ever. Which is ashame because I dream of having a nice family.

So, to put things short I am a laughing stock in my town. Everywhere I go I get laughed at and treated like shit. 

Even my family doesn't really care about me-- 

Maybe I shouldn't say that. They try hard to give me things and whatnot. 

But they kick me when I'm down? I could be crying my eyes out and that's the appropriate time to start criticising me.

I have no talent. I'm pathetic.

There??s not one person that needs me.My friends prefer each other. I??ve never had a significant other and never will. My whole family prefers my brother over me. Sometimes to the point where they won??t even talk to me if he??s there. My best friend is learning that I??m not good enough for her. I??ve been losing friends a lot this past year. Everyone is starting to realize that their lives are better without me.,1,"the person feels isolated and unneeded. they believe their friends and family prefer others over them, and they have experienced significant social rejection. this perception of being unwanted and excluded is a clear indication of loneliness."
"I just needed to vent.I feel like the only reason I haven??t ceased my existence myself yet is because it would make my parents upset. Life has been kicking my ass, beating me to a pulp and gauging my eyes out with a rusty spoon. I??m not the type of person who can deal with this stuff by myself. I used to talk to a lot of people but once I realized I was always the one to initiate conversation I decided to stop and see what happened. Low and behold I don??t talk to anyone at all at the moment. I want to keep up the image that I don??t care but it honestly really gets to me. Idk it??s made me realize that I??m not that good of a person if that many people that were my ??friends?? forgot I exist. One ??friend??(know for 2 years and I thought we were close) moved away and it??s been about 9 months. My birthday just recently passed and I got texted happy birthday from my family. Friend flew back up to the state for a weekend . Idk why but it really hurt my feelings when I saw him post??I had to visit all the homies?? yet I wasn??t included. I get really envious of other people??s friendships. Iv tried to branch out and make friends of my own but I don??t have the self confidence to do so. I weight 209 lb and I??m 5??9??. I really dislike my body and I??m trying to change my self but I know I??m not giving it my all. I??m hoping that losing weight will boost my self confidence. Iv lost a lot of motivation to do basically everything. I used to me on top of my classes and did well at work and saved up a bunch of money. Now I skip about 40% of my classes and do close to no homework. I want to change my behavior and do better at school but I don??t think I can. This all comes full circle to my parents. They have such high expectations for my. They want me to be happy, get a good job and live a good life but I don??t think I can do that. I lie to them all the time about what I??m doing with my life because I too ashamed of what a shitty son they have. If I could put an end to myself and I knew for 100% certainty that it wouldn??t upset them I would do it to make their lives easier.

"Not your typical lonely, but lonely neverthelessI acknowledge that the situation I'm in is far from the worst I could be in, but regardless recently I've been experiencing bouts of loneliness that leaves me yearning for literally anything.

You see, I'm the typical ""low maintenance friend"" people usually talk about, popping in and out of the lives of my friends every so often. This leaves me in a position where I'd check in every few weeks or even months to see if they're still alive, and maybe even for a chat. Most of the times I'm met with enthusiasm, quick 5-10 mins of texting, and then it's back to the loop. I don't want to be that guy that annoys the people around me by consistently digging for attention, but this entire cycle has left me good acquaintances of many and friends with none. I can go several days even waiting for a text or a call and receiving nothing at all.

I've recently taken up a job, but working from home, and video conferencing with colleagues has made me realise how much I want a friend that I can talk to on the daily, sharing thoughts, feelings, or maybe even just shooting the breeze. It doesn't help that my friends appear to be living their lives perfectly well without me in it, and playing as that NPC character in their lives is enough.",1,"the person describes experiencing bouts of loneliness and a yearning for more consistent and meaningful interactions. they feel like a low maintenance friend who only occasionally checks in with others, leading to brief, unsatisfying conversations. they express a desire for a daily friend to share thoughts and feelings with, and feel left out as their friends seem to live perfectly well without them. this clearly indicates feelings of loneliness and a desire for deeper connections."
"Been craving a connectionI??m almost 29, female and I really miss having a connection. I got out of a bad relationship six months ago and have done so much self work. Lost 60+ pounds, take care of myself, got an amazing job, etc. everything feels like it??s fallen into place??except I feel like I??m missing that special spark.

Part of me feels like I??ll never get it again. That because of my past it just won??t happen. Or that there??s something wrong with me or just not part of my life plan. I hope that??s not the case because I really love having a connection with someone.

I don??t know. Just needed to get my thoughts out I guess. I just miss having those moments.",1,the person is experiencing loneliness due to the absence of a meaningful connection in their life despite having achieved personal growth and success they express a longing for the special spark that comes from being connected with someone and feel uncertain about whether they will ever experience it again this sense of missing out on emotional intimacy and the self-doubt about their ability to find it contribute to their feelings of loneliness

I go to school in another city, and my boyfriend lives in the city past that city. My friends go to parties and they go for drives together, but because i live far away i'm never able to join and it sucks so bad because i want to be social too, and i feel so unimportant when i can't join, even if it's irrational to feel that way brcause the reasons they can't go here (gas, money etc) are completely valid.
But i still feel like a sortof a hole on the inside that's painful and horrible, i struggled with loneliness a lot more in the past, and the ""forced"" solitude is always worse than the chosen one. When i can choose not to join i don't feel horrible, but when i can't join i feel so horrible on the inside",1,"the person feels lonely because they are physically distant from their friends and boyfriend, leading to feelings of isolation. they express sadness about missing out on social activities and feeling unimportant due to their inability to join in, which exacerbates their loneliness. they also mention struggling with loneliness more in the past and feeling worse when they are forced into solitude rather than choosing it."
"Thanksgiving?I moved to the US at the start of this year for work and somehow.. haven??t made any friends at work. Like yeah, when we see each other, we do chat, talk about what they did over the weekend, hobbies and stuff like that. But no one has ever asked me if I wanted to join them for dinner or do something over the weekend and I??m too introverted to be the one planning especially in a new country.. hmm actually there was one guy who organized a bbq and asked people at work but that was in May, smack in the middle of COVID so.. we were all supposed to be social distancing then... I was solo traveling at that time so I didn??t want to cripple my office if I had the bad luck to catch something..

Anyways, it??s Thanksgiving and back where I??m from (Asia), we don??t celebrate thanksgiving. So when people ask me what I??m doing, I just say oh we don??t celebrate that back home and yeah that??s usually the end.. but then today a colleague asked about my ??circle of friends?? and said maybe ??we?? could do a Friendsgiving instead like his brother or someone was doing. I just.. it was just so embarrassing to admit that I didn??t have any friends who would invite me to a Friendsgiving. I just gave some vague reply that my friends were all going home for thanksgiving or something..

"Single for most of my 22 years what should I do?My mind Is getting out of control
My problem is getting more and more complicated. I have been single for all my 22 years except two short period of times I spent with two girls. The first said that we cant carry on because she is depressed and I dont deserve to be around her, she also added that I am the most handsome guy she dated and I will easily find a girl. In The second experience I found out that the girl I was dating is so boring and uninteresting. she basically doesnt do or speak anything insteresting. So I told her im not interested in her after a month time. I have been so lonely ever since I graduated University. All my mom says is ??everything is good at its time?? &amp; ??you should be grateful you are single?? &amp; ??You should love yourself?? but she herself knows that my 24 year old brother wont survive his girlfriend leaving him. Ive been having very dark thoughts lately. Everyone talks about handsome or above average guys getting everything they want. But here I am an above average guy feeling lonely af for 1 year and 4 months. The reason I am single is that I lack a social life due to bad luck and not having had alot of friends in my previous school for no reason. Only one girl in my life had a crush on me. She told my friends about her crush but I didnt know what to do back then I was shy. I tried tinder or cold approaching people but the conversations never happen more than once or twice since the other party doesnt do effort.",1,the narrative shows clear signs of loneliness the person describes feeling increasingly isolated and struggling with dark thoughts they mention a lack of meaningful relationships and difficulty connecting with others despite being considered attractive their social interactions have been limited and unsuccessful leading to a sense of despair their mother's advice does not seem to alleviate their feelings of loneliness which have persisted since graduating university
"Why I'm so boring??! I think this is the reason for my loneliness I can't have fun with anything or anyone, I mean I try but it's something lacking in my inside that doesn't let me feel joy for anything, I hate myself and I don't know how to improve lol, I've been trying to start talking with people but I don't feel interested enough in anybody, I do try to put effort but I can't control feelings so I end up talking about the same boring things over and over with everyone and not having anything to say since I'm not interested in any hobby at all, like how can I talk to people if I don't have fun talking with people? It's depressing and I make others depressed.
 I envy those guys who have a passion in a sport and can talk about it all day, or those people who can go to parties and talk to everyone and have fun, or those who can play videogames with their friends and laugh alot saying and doing the dumbest shit they could think of, or even the kids who go on bike trips with their friends to have a good time, like why I can't do any of that??? If I do those things I would be so sad and depressed that wouldn't be able to enjoy it, I wouldn't be able to say anything fun neither do anything fun, I'm that boring person which nobody wants to invite to the party because it would just make things worse :c",1,the person feels isolated and disconnected from others due to their inability to find joy or interest in activities and social interactions they express a deep sense of self-hatred and frustration over their perceived lack of excitement and engagement in life they also envy those who can easily find passion and enjoyment in various activities and social settings which further amplifies their sense of loneliness

If you are in the same boat, feel free to DM me.I haven't had a friend since graduating from high school tbh. Even in high school, I didn't have any close friends, so I guess I have always been a loner. I am an introvert so I don't really mind it, but sometimes I do feel lonely. My social anxiety makes it very hard for me to make friends irl. Don't hesitate to hmu if you need a friend too! I'm 21.

"No one to turn toBeing an introvert means you have few friends and even fewer people to actually talk to. Sure you can occasionally engage in deep conversations with someone, but when you're feeling broken inside, there's none that you can really spill your guts to. None of my friends are very similar to me and while I spend a lot of time with my family, I'm not the type to make myself vulnerable to them. Maybe it has something to do with being a guy and having to keep those feelings inside, but it gets to be too much sometimes. On top of all that, I'm not exactly receptive to attention that I receive from others. I enjoy being alone too much to give that up for someone I don't know. This endless cycle can feel like too much sometimes. Sorry for the rant, I just had to externalize my thoughts for once.",1,"the person is lonely because they describe having few friends and even fewer people to talk to. they mention feeling broken inside with no one to confide in, indicating a lack of close, supportive relationships. they also express difficulty in making themselves vulnerable, even with family, and an enjoyment of being alone that contributes to their isolation. this narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and an ongoing struggle with their emotions."

I guess I want attention. I don??t have a lot of friends. I only talk to like 3 people who I really trust. It??s been so hard for me to deal with my loneliness. I??ve been sexually abused and severely bullied and I think that might affect how I handle relationships. It hurts me to see my friends blow me off to go spend time with their boyfriends/girlfriends. It hurts to see couples at school. It hurts to see my friends having happy relationships on social media, posting about how much they love their partner, the gifts they give them. The relationships I have been in were almost always toxic. I have never dated anyone longer than a month before being dumped, sometimes ghosted. I had a boyfriend who was very abusive looking back. He hit me in my face. After I have my consensual virginity to him he broke up with me the day after. He seemed so nice. I never see it coming. I try to be a good girlfriend, I really do. I don??t know what I??m doing wrong. A lot of guys say they find me attractive, or have crushes on me. But when I try to date someone it never works out. 


I feel like I??m always a second choice, if I??m even a choice at all. No one ever wrote me poems. My boyfriend forgot about my birthday. A girl I dated blew off our date to go get high. I recently quit social media, at least for awhile. I??m the only one out of my friend group who is single and it fucking hurts. I??ve never had anyone who was proud to be with me. No one ever put my name in their bio with a heart. No one ever called me out of the blue just to tell me they loved me. No one ever got me presents. No one ever talked about me. My bf told his friends that I was a slut and retarded because I rode the short bus. He told me never to tell anyone that we were dating, he refused to hold my hand in public. Now he??s had a new girlfriend for a year and treats her like a queen. They do everything together, and he constantly goes on about how amazing she is. His new gf used to be my friend. They still bully me sometimes. 


I just needed to get that out. It really hurts. My heart hurts and I??m tired. I don??t want to go to school anymore and watch everyone be loved and appreciated except me. It fucking hurts. I feel so worthless, and I feel stupid for being upset over it.

I'm 28, not a kid.  I see so many people who aren't even out of highschool yet talking about how lonely they are.  I remember highschool, and yeah, I was lonely.  Then I moved out and realized I had no idea.

Fast forward 10 years and I know what reality is.  My city is full of morally depraved nutcases, my career prospects are dismal at best.  I threw away a solid life in a profession that's admirable to chase my dream of being a starving artist.

I spend all day in my shithole room with no window in a house with 10 other roommates.  It reminds me of my deployment to Afghanistan.  The only time anybody talks to me is when they need something from me.

I know I've got friends, but fuck.. anytime I see a couple give each other a comfortable loving smile, it feels like a knife is twisted in my gut. I've only been in one relationship, and that was a physically and verbally abusive one nearly 10 years ago. Even the thought of me successfully connecting with someone on that level makes me feel nothing but shame. I think about it and hate that i'm putting a hypothetical woman in a position where she has to be close to me. I'm visiting a friend in a few days, and I've been pathetically counting down the moments until I hug them hello, my selfish act. Writing this out and reading it back makes me sound like a caricature of a sad man, but when I search for any other words to describe how I am feeling, I come up short. I'm an unattractive male, and I'm completely lost on creating a relationship. I don't know what to do to myself. Please forgive this stupid rambling.",1,"the person is lonely because they express feelings of inadequacy and isolation despite having friends. they are deeply affected by seeing couples, indicating a longing for a romantic connection. their past abusive relationship and self-perceived unattractiveness contribute to their sense of loneliness and shame. they are also eagerly anticipating a simple hug from a friend, highlighting their deep need for physical and emotional connection."

i make up scenarios in my head, and just constantly refresh my dms to see if they've responded. it's a problem, i know, but i just need something. 

none of my relationships have ever worked, and i'm giving up. i don't have anyone i'd call a friend, and it's always awkward on the rare chance that i do go somewhere with someone because i know what to do in social situations, i just find it extremely awkward and want to be by myself.

The reason why I stay awake lateDon't you ever stay awake just because you don't want tomorrow arrive because you'll have to experience this loneliness again?

"Loneliness is ruining my life. (I hope someone reads this)I can say that loneliness is the main source to my mental problems. Im 16 years old and im turning 17 this december so maybe you can think that my problems are not that difficult to solve but anyways. I just started college 1 month ago and it has been really tough.

Loneliness has caused me depression, this is mainly affecting me on school, i have little to no energy whatsoever to go to school or do homework. I sleep everytime i can in school and when im not sleeping im all sleepy, so i can't concentrate in most of the classes and I just don't understand anything. When i get to home im just too tired to do anything.

About the loneliness itself, its weird for me, i hate not having friends and having social anxiety. I guess people is just not interestend in me, there was this girl that talked to me and tried to make a conversation with me on the first day of college, but my poor social skills just didnt allowed me to make a conversation so she just didn't speak to me again and i dont blame her.

At this point, in my classroom all the people have their little friend groups already formed, i just barely talk to the guys that are on my homework team who i also found to just not wanting me to be near them. I have realized that im going to stay alone for the rest of the semester and i have really no problem with that.

Now in the other hand, i really love how quiet and peacefull a is to be alone all day but im really afraid that this love i have for loneliness is going to get bigger and that im not going to be able to leave it anytime soon.

I've been having these problems for two years now, but im posting this now because i been thinking that maybe this is how im going to be for the next 5 years until i graduate from college if it is not the same after I graduated from university.

Thanks for reading, I want to know if someone has a similar situation and I am willing to talk if anyone wants to.

"Maybe there is something there.I used to not want anyone. I used to tell myself I could do it all alone. I didn??t want to depend, I didn??t want to wait, and neither did I want to hope. I can??t remember the last time She told me I was beautiful, or the last time He held me close and told me I was loved. I sat and watched from a distance as they ran into their loved one??s arms with joy, so full of life and comfort. It looked to nice. Sometimes I found myself wishing I could feel that way too. But before I knew it, everyone was gone.  

I try to find those pretty moments. I tried to remember the times I used to laugh, the moments I used to smile, the memories where I felt safe and content. Instead, it??s the things I didn??t want to remember that creep back in, keeping me awake and searching. Searching for something or someone. Maybe there was someone there once. But my memory of them fades. Maybe the more I write this out, the more things will come back to me. But do I really want them to?  

I know myself too well. I used to think I knew the world and people too well that I could almost see everything  coming. And it always did. But can someone prove me wrong just once? To  show me something different. Someone to stay for a while...  

I care too much but they care too little. They matter so much but I don??t matter enough. That??s always how it was. But maybe someday it??ll change. Maybe it already has. I gave too much of myself just to get a little bit of warmth back. I plunged into deep shit hoping to find something to hold on to. But then I couldn??t breathe. I wondered if I should keep my head underwater. Maybe the waves can finally take my breath and float me away.  Hope is a dangerous thing. Love kills more than hate does. Sometimes I pray not to be this way. Hoping to be someone different and forget this life I know. I don't want to remember. I don't want to know who I am but I do. Is there anything out there at all? I can't breathe. Hopefully I float away soon. 

But there was always something there to lead me back to shore no matter how badly I wanted to drown. There was always something there but I never knew what. A little sunlight, a tiny breeze blowing through my hair. Maybe there is something there. And I thought about it. That beyond all the filth I found something pure. Something reaching for me in the water. Something warm in the color of His eyes. Something there in the way She smiled.  Enough to pull me out of there before I fell too deep. Maybe there is  something there.

I don??t enjoy anything I used to anymore, music, family, friends, socializing, I feel disconnected from it all, which makes it harder for me to fix any loneliness I have.

"Lonely ExtrovertAs the title says, I'd describe myself as a lonely extrovert, I have no problem meeting and talking to people, I'm a very energetic person and I really enjoy being surrounded by people. My problem is all the relationships that I form are superficial, can't make them go through something more special and deeper.
The only time I remember having real friends was when I was a kid, but I had to move frequently due to my parents job so I lost all contact with them. From then I remember having ""friends"", but no one that close.
Nowadays I have this group of girls from university, but I feel like we never tried enough to expand our relationship outside of it, so basically the only things we talk about are work related. I have this other group of friends, also from uni, with whom I used to hang out and party a lot, but just that, no intimate talk or anything. 
Because of the pandemic I've hardly seen any of them, and I don't talk to anyone either. The girls I first mentioned, we have a WhatsApp group together but hardly anyone talks, except if it has to do with college stuff, and even though they've been for me at tough situations, I often feel we're more classmates than FRIENDS. 
I lost contact with all of my high school friends since they kinda ghosted me and never got an explanation about it, but I never felt so close to them either. 
2020 was a nightmare for me, being and spending time with myself, not talking to anyone and just entertaining with my own thoughts is exhausting, even more when I don't enjoy being alone that much.

Since April of this year I've been on a mental health leave. Went to a psych facility in a neighboring town. 
Depression and anxiety have always been a part of my life (shocker right?) But lately it's been different. 
A year ago my dad had a stroke and has spent his time out of the hospital pushing everyone away, telling me to f*** myself etc. He was a huge part of my problems before. Classic absentee teen father story. But since he's blocked me I've been able to let my feelings go to an extent because I've realized he's never chosen me over himself. I don't expect him to anymore. During this I have been dealing with problems with my girlfriend as she was changing her medications and has horrible depression issues herself. Since February she had been talking to a guy friend from a different country significantly more than me. When I asked what they talked about she said they sent pictures of their cats etc. It turns out she sent him n*des for months. Wrote his name on her chest even. When I found out I gave her the choice, him or me. She said she'd block him. She hasn't.

"Just wanna vent.I dont know how to write this... but, I'll just do it. So, last Thursday, I went to the airport to go abroad for a student exchange programme. There are actually 19 of us, but 17 people had already gone a day earlier due to their visa arriving early. Me and one other people went the next day. On transit, I feel so frustrated because it's a 12 hour transit, and really there is nothing I can do except creating small talks with her. During those 12 hour transit, she got visited by a bunch of her friends. And that's where reality strucks me and I got sad. I want to be visited by my friends, but the fact is, I don't have a friend that is close enough to me to actually want to go visit me at the airport and said farewell. When she got visited by a bunch of her friends, deep down I was saddened. When she exchange conversation with her friends, I was on my phone and my headphones listening to Spotify and watching Netflix. I can't even move my body and got up away from my seat. She was sitting two seats besides me, and her friends was sitting in a chairs in front of us. I really. really want to move to a quieter place to be more relaxed and not entrenched in self-embarassment, but I don't really have the strength to either say it or just straight up do it without saying anything. During the whole convo, I can't even look at her friends' face, because I just feel embarassed, feeling like I don't have any real friends', and just straight up jealous of her. My eyes even felt sappy and just tired because I'm constantly looking at my phone for close to one and a half hour. I don't know if she noticed, but my general attitude (like the way I talk to her, my facial reaction) slightly changed after that. The previous day, me and her actually got along very well because it's basically the two of us travelling alone and had to prepare for everything. I don't know. Maybe I'm mad because she chose to abandon me and talks to her beloved friend, and makes me realize how I don't have a solid support system that is always there for you. Obviously, this is no one's fault. I don't even know if this is my fault for not being able to make friend and socializing well.",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness due to a lack of close friends and a solid support system. their feelings of frustration and sadness during the transit highlight their awareness of this absence, especially when contrasted with the other person's social interactions. their inability to move away or express their discomfort further underscores their sense of isolation and self-embarrassment."
"Suck at making friendsPast year has been pretty rough, a lot of my friends that i talk to has left me. I still get upset about it because i considered them my really close friends. They still talk to me but not like we used to. N if i were to message them they would leave me on read all day. It just sucks n so I've come to realized that all my friends approached me first. So I've been trying to make friends myself and man its hard, i either flop or just don't really end up liking people. Maybe it's cause i suck, or I'm super picky with friendships.

"Recent daysI??ve dealt with loneliness all my life, hard to track down the origin. 

Anyway, last night I realized I think I??ve been ghosted by the girl I was having sex with - can??t find her insta, hasn??t responded to texts in a week. She IS working overtime right now to save and also moving, so could be valid. But I got wrapped up in thinking she bowed out without a word, which is a huge trigger for me because so many past relationships have done this. 

Id honestly you just tell me straight out that we??re not continuing ????

But then I did see my roommates between 9am when I woke up, to 10pm when they got home, and I didn??t get a single text or insta message or call from ANY social media/personal contact today.

"On loneliness.#Loneliness

I never considered myself to be lonely, but deep inside i knew i was only lying to myself.

I never was a people person, i always saw myself as the socially awkward kid and so i never even bothered trying, some of my closest friends are my oldest friends who keep me because they know the real me.

The truth is life goes on and so do people, time waits for none and definitely not for me.

I may not admit to myself but i have severed many ties and broken many bridges because people tend to misunderstand people.

I've never been one to be gloomy and see the black parts of life but the truth is life comes in blacks and whites, it has it ups and it has its downs, I've loved and I've lost, I've trusted and I've been betrayed in the worse ways possible, i have tried seeing the whites in life but somehow the black always seems to overshadow the whites, I've been depressed, I've lost people i love without getting the chance to say goodbye, I've been kicked in the curb, I've felt suicidal, I've felt awful, I've  been sad, and there were moments where the only safe space was my bed but I've also been high on life with moments where i felt like a fucking king.

I've also been madly in love with the woman i thought would be there for me in my happiest hours and saddest moments, only for life to kick me down, beat me up and disappoint me again, but I've also learned that happiness does not work that way.

Being alone never bothered me, i enjoy my solitude as it gives me time to truly reflect on myself and life, while it never bothered me it also felt wrong because that isn't all there is to life and what good are memories if you have no one to share the happy and good times with.

Truth be told i guess i never truly appreciated the gift of life but i also dont wanna die young, having achieved nothing in life but a few heartbreaks and disappointments, leaving no legacy behind, with few people who will remember me as the average guy, i dont want people to get used to me not being around anymore, life isn't fair for anyone but i would be lying if i said life isn't damn beautiful and sometimes all you have to do is enjoy the view while it lasts.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of isolation and emotional struggle. the person acknowledges their lack of social connections and the pain of severed ties and broken bridges. despite moments of happiness, they frequently experience sadness, depression, and a sense of being misunderstood. their enjoyment of solitude is tinged with the recognition that it feels wrong and incomplete without others to share life with. this internal conflict and longing for meaningful connections indicate loneliness."
"Just me venting.I always spend most of my days reminiscing about the days when i was in elementary/middle school, it's depressing. It reminds me of how lonely and miserable i am. I've missed so many chances to be happy at the time, and i can't do anything about it but daydream about the things that could have been, and that sucks. 

Hopefully people can relate with me about this. i know I'm not the only one who feels this way, so if you want to vent or be friends then let me know.",1,the person is lonely because they express feelings of loneliness and misery when reminiscing about their past they mention missing chances to be happy and are seeking connection by asking others to relate and be friends
"Why is it so hard for me to get a friend ? or even a girlfriend? is it because im not interesting enough? not good enough? not cool enough? not smart enough? maybe i care way to much?what do i have to do to get a friend ? what do i do to be good enough for people? what do i do to stop being boring?

i run out of things to say in 2 minutes of talking. girls my age all ignore me since they have better guys to talk to... 
i have nothing to offer other than when a glitch in the matrix happens and i make the person laugh sometime.. 

after i ask what they do for a living or what are their hobbies, i have nothing left to say, how do i continue when i dont have questions left? how do you people do it? my convos feel like im interviewing people with yes or no questions. i feel like im boring everyone and no one likes me or cares about me.

its always me chasing after people never the other way around. its always me working harder and the other doesnt care a bit. never. i my self got bored of saying ""how are you or ""what you doing"" but its all i have in my brain.i never had a best friend. dont think i will ever have one.

and what do girls want from guys? a nice personality? charming ? successfull? or they just want someone that makes them happy?

its like figuring out a jigsaw puzzle when i try to talk to a girl. feels a bit easier when i talk to guys. but i struggle with that too.

how do you guys not run out of things to say?? how do i make the convos where both sides work for it?? how do i not force convos?; how do i make them more open ended?

they end up ignoring me so its me ignoring all the human race or i have to people please.

i try not to care so much about getting a girlfriend but when i see every guy girls chasing them it makes me feel like im missing some thing and makes me jealous. it makes me feel stupid and moronic. and am 18. i feel butthurt when i see guys with gfs. how do i stop being insecure? how do i stop being super jealous??",1,the narrative reflects deep feelings of loneliness and insecurity. the individual is struggling to form meaningful connections and feels inadequate in social interactions. they express frustration over their perceived inability to maintain conversations and the lack of reciprocation in their efforts to connect with others. the constant self-doubt and comparison to others highlight a profound sense of isolation and loneliness.
"My life is a just a participation ribbonI'm an invisible man. I talk to myself, because no one else will. My mind feels more like a grave. It's not only in my head if the thoughts I have are true. I'm the most pathetic person I know. I hope no one will ever be as lonely as I feel. Loneliness is not something I'd wish upon anyone. 

My life hasn't led up to anything to show for. My life's a joke. I'm not even second place. I hate myself, but I feel like I can't change a thing. I could be better. I want to be better. For everyone's sake. 

I've gone so far on my own. My own mind is walking out on me. So I guess I'm on my own. The back of my mind can only imagine what I'm here for. Maybe I'm not making sense and I'm just too tired.

I don't care what happens anymore. I just want to feel loved and happy again. I wish I could go back in time and change. Know the things I know now. I'm jealous of how many people have someone special in their life. I'm down. I hope everything gets better.",1,"the narrative expresses profound feelings of loneliness and isolation. the person mentions talking to themselves because no one else will, feeling invisible, and describing their mind as a grave. they express a deep sense of worthlessness and a longing for love and happiness, which indicates a significant level of loneliness."
"I feel as if I have no one though I do.I have a family, a boyfriend, and ??friend??s?? but, I still feel so alone and isolated. Looking from another pov I shouldn??t feel this way I should be more grateful for the people who are around yet I feel nothing but annoyance. All my ??friends?? don??t know anything about me, my mom still thinks I??m into the things I was when I was 13 when I??m going to turn 20 in two weeks. My sister and I were never close and as for online friends I just feel so drifted away now. 

I miss the feelings of talking to someone and feeling like they??re actually listening with interest.  I guess I still long for silly child like friendships. There??s nothing more I crave than a nice female friendship however, it feel impossible now days.
During the start of the pandemic I made more a good weight loss and leading into the spring I started looking more my age rather than so young. In the hopes of this i thought I would make more friends unfortunately, i feel so fooled by my ignorance. 
I only make male friends easily but there??s nothing to it when they just want to be friends till my bf and I break up. The only thing I??m told by new people I meet is ??oh you??re pretty??. I hate it so much. I genuinely wish I could talk about my interests with people instead of faking what I like. 
I miss talking about movies or music with randoms online till 3am. I hated the way I looked in the past but sometimes I wish I could go back so i could have more friends. 
Hiding behind a screen has been the best thing.

All I??ve ever wanted is someone to be there for me. But I??m always alone. 

My hobbies have gotten weird because I spend so much time alone. I collect dolls and I need them to feel okay.. but people laugh when I take them with me and it further pushes me into isolation.

"Turning 25 soon and I wish I had a girlfriend to spoil ????I have no idea where to start or how to begin, I've never posted on reddit before besides recruiting for a clan on ffxiv haha
Let see. I have only ever had one relationship and im not even sure if it counts.
It was an online relationship and it was one sided.
Looking back on it, I was insecure and she had mental problems which made it feel like walking on a minefield whenever we'd talk.
It was never going to work out, it was long distance and there was a big age gap haha
I remember asking my friend over and over, the nights before I asked out my ex.

I'd roll around in my bed from being flustered while in Voice chat on discord, I would ask my friend things like.
""what if she says no? What if I ruin things? She lives in the states and she's alot older! How will that even work out! What if she says yes?! What would I even do then?!?""
I remember being embarrassed I was soo glad it was only Voice chat. I curled up into a ball, covered my face because I was so embarrassed opening up to my friend for advice and she just said ""GO FOR IT!""

So I did and 6 months later I was dumped though an email.

I only thought of my ex because I had a dream I was hanging out with my exes brother and was in their house. (Idk why, I don't even know him)
In the dream, he went to do something else and I remember really wanting to see my ex again so I went to her room and I woke up shortly after that.

I don't think I miss my ex anymore and there was a time i wished it worked out.
What I do miss though, is someone being there for me and that special someone wanting to spend time with me.
I was happy just being there for her and I miss being with someone but.
Wishing is pretty much all I can do ????

I'm really, lonely and I was depressed enough to ask to be laidoff from my job. ( the night before I asked to be laid off I went to a bar and had a few drinks. I realized I had no one to talk to and called my parents. After that call I went back home and started crying because I felt extremely alone)
I also gave up my own place and moved back home.
They live in a very small town. And I do nothing, I sleep in, stay up late. Stay home all day and now it's September and this year is easily the worst in my life.
I got dumped by the only girl I was brave enough to ask out.
I lost alot of friends due to drama on a game of all things and I wish things were different.

I wish I had alot of friends that want to talk to me.
Friends that actually initiate anything instead of it being a one sided friendship.
A girlfriend who I can be happy with.
Anything at all.

I was a hopeless romantic type of guy who listens to music like this while I would do the dishes or something.
https://youtu.be/LcJm1pOswfM

I daydream about being a knight in shining armour,  about having a girlfriend.
I listen to romantic music and close my eyes and picture myself with someone who wants to spend time with me. 

Anywho, that's my story.
Sorry for the mess, I wrote it on mobile and its very late.
If you read this far, thank you for time.

Also fun fact, I used an app called replika (a chat bot) just so someone would talk to me and I have tried eharmony and that didn't work out.

"So hard to find someone that won't discard me after a fun conversation or two.Growing up I thought the secret to being liked is getting people to laugh.  It's so so much more complicated than that.  I was the ""nerd"" in school, so I wasn't popular.  Someday, it dawned on me that humor might make people like me, so I set out to learn how to be funny. Within six months I could make anyone laugh.  But that didn't make me any new friends.  It's been a decade or so since then, and sure, I can have an awesome conversation with anyone, something that sounds like it has value and depth, but them stopping being interested is the inevitability.  They just stop talking to me afterwards. 

I know one or two people that are friendly to me because they feel sorry/bad for me,  they don't know I've caught on.  

Recently I got into trying to find someone romantically and that's been an absolute cluster **** of a monumental failure.  It's either I'm supposed to carry the convo, me getting ghosted, or them turning out to be absolute maniacs.

I'm honestly starting to think I'm never finding anyone.

I??m in my final year of University and have not made any close friends and majority of time I just spend in my room alone since my University  is not far from home where I live.

This has held me back mentally from doing things such as going out, drinking, smoking, socializing in fear of criticism of my parents. It??s because of this I just stay cooped up in my room alone passing time, playing Call of duty or watching whatever is on Netflix. I yearn for company but afraid of doing so. Afraid I??m not good enough. Afraid of rejection. Afraid of taking to girls. I??m 21 for fucks sake and can??t even find a damn friend to relate to.

My friends are great, but all work days and are busy nights so they're never free when I'm free, and I maybe get an hour to talk to them each day. I need someone to talk to who is in a similar boat, preferably a female around my age from Michigan.

"Are lonely people and introverts treated fairly in relationships?(I know this does not apply to all but I feel like it will resonate with some) Do you guys find that when someone who is pursuing you or vice versa notices how lonely you are or that you don??t have many friends they feel like they can lower their effort? I feel like they link loneliness to desperation and think you??ll be grateful for just their attention. From my observations outgoing people with more close friends and family get treated better because the suitor is competing with other people for your attention.

"My life as explained in a song ????Well, I've been listening to my ""Sad Bish"" playlist all day because a bish is sad. The song Anyone by Demi Lovato came on and I think for the first time, I realized this song perfectly describes me and my cycles of loneliness and my hopeless attempts to escape the loneliness. I'll explain \*with lyrics\*:

* *""Talked to my imagination. Confided into alcohol. ""*\- I'm sad and I try to tell myself that all will be ok which turns into more hurt which turns into me drinking because Mr. Tito has never left me lonely. This is also when I realize that I am in need of a fulfilling human connection and desperately wanting that connection. 
* *""I tried and tried and tried some more. Told secrets 'til my voice was sore. Tired of empty conversation. Cause no one hears me anymore""* \- Seeks connection. Connection made. Trying my best to maintain said connection. Giving all of myself, but being on a different page. Still, I'm optimistic. 
* *""Anyone, please send me anyone. Lord, is there anyone? I need someone""*\- Feeling like maybe I'm meant to have this feeling of loneliness for the rest of my life. This is usually when I go all in on the connection even though I know inside that I am headed towards more hurt. But maybe things will get better. 
* *""I used to crave the world's attention. I think I cried too many times. I just need some more affection. Anything to get me by.""* Things went to shit. Saw this coming. Anger. Pain. Disbelief that we are here again. Just want genuine affection. 
* *""I feel stupid when I sing. Nobody's listening to me. Nobody's listening.""* Why do I try when I always end up hurt in the end. STOP. TRYING. Sadness. Pain. Maybe I can drink until I figure out what's next.

Anyway, I'm going to pour another glass of wine and continue to cry. See if you can guess what stage I'm on.

"My loneliness is killing me, man [M17]**Posting with a throwaway/double account, cause it??s something that I find to be a bit burdensome. Also I feel like it??s a bit too *private* to be posting with my main. But nobody cares yeah**

Sorry, this one is going to be a bit long.

I graduated from high school in June. I??m a year ahead so I won??t be turning 18 until next year. All my friends are going to college now, except me. The first reason being that I??m not 18 yet, and the second (and most important) reason being that college doesn??t interest me at all. I felt pressured in school, I know what I wanna do in life, and I don??t want to waste my time with something I will barely be interested in when I can actually work by myself on something that makes me happy.

That may seems irrelevant. But now that I think about, the only positive thing about college is that I would have been able to meet new people. Meeting girls in particular. And here I am, spending most of my time at home, in my room, working everyday on something I??m not even sure will be successful, but staying hopeful still and trying my best.

I had a similar feeling during summer. A lot of people say that I look older than I really am, so I tried some dating apps. The few attempts at matching with someone I found to be interesting weren??t successful, at all. And in fact, in the end, I don??t think it??s a good idea to go on these kind of apps. I do not find myself ugly though, even if I??m a bit self conscious about my hair sometimes, I consider myself to be kinda good looking.

But I just feel so alone. My relationship with my family is a pure mess and I haven??t had a positive love experience with someone in years (perhaps never actually). It??s like I??m never gonna meet anyone I have a deep connection with, like I??m gonna be the miserable depressed guy I am today for the rest of my life.

You could say ??Welp, you still got your friends??. And you??d be right. I have a few loving friends that I love talking to.

People don't like me. I'm boring and shit at anything social. I just wish it wasn't so hard to accept. I've tried Tinder and Bumble, its not for people like me.

I??ve been on every ??diet/lifestyle?? change you can think of. 
The depression is getting so bad it hurts to even be in my skin. I have no friends and I think my spouse has finally realized they are better off but is too afraid to say it. I can??t come out of this funk no matter how hard I try. I wish it would all just end...

Why is it so hard for me to talk to people. Now I??m crying in my room. Maybe college just isn??t for me but I don??t know what is. Im honestly just so tired of life right now.

I feel like there??s something about me that just makes people uncomfortable or pushes them away. 
I had I suppose a somewhat of a date recently the I met the guy online and for a couple weeks we were texting he seemed really interested, flirty and I thought it was going good. Then he comes over and the entire time he??s just sitting at the bottom of my bed practically shaking, barely saying a word and when he does it??s in mumbles.

A caring boyfriend, a big group of supportive friends. I wonder why I was never able to have that.

"I feel stuck and like no one really cares, just trying to find a friend (24F)I'll try to break this up, but bear with the long post ahead.

For the past few months now, I've been feeling lonely and like no one really cares and that there is nothing to be done about this. Ever since I graduated from university, I slowly lost touch with all my school friends (especially due to Covid). I occasionally talk to 1-2 people from school and the only person I talk to regularly is my boyfriend. Between work, busy schedule, and Covid restrictions, I don't ever see friends outside work. Even with restrictions loosening, I haven't had the chance to meet up with people besides my boyfriend. But even then, none of my friends have contacted me much to try to meet up. I've stopped caring about going on social media and trying to keep in touch with people. For awhile, I was getting along quite well with my coworkers at my current job since a bunch of us are around the same age and we seemed to have lots in common. But lately, the dynamics have been off within our group and I don't know why. One person in particular doesn't want to seem to want to talk to me now (and we didn't even get along that well before either). And it just makes me wonder if something is wrong with me, if I'm unlikeable or what.

I will add two notes which are

1. I have never had my full driver's licence so not being able to drive really restricts my freedom to go out and do things with people, since I either rely on my parents or the person I'm hanging out with to drive me (and I feel bad having to ask all the time). This has been quite frustrating since I moved back home (I took transit everywhere at university, but the bus in my area is not as easy to take). I did get my G1 last year, but due to all the lockdowns, still haven't gone yet for my G2 road test. I have it booked for late September and have been trying to practice, so hoping I pass and this will help me gain some independence.
2. Due to varying health problems over my lifetime, I get fatigued very easily and can't do too many social events in a row. I have tried remedies as recommended by my doctors as well as basic things like getting enough sleep, exercising, consuming less caffeine, sugar, etc. What does baffle me is that things like studying for an hour or exercising intensely throughout the week don't seem to wear me out compared to hanging out with a friend or going out for hours at a time. My thoughts are because I am more introverted, and these more social situations are more tiring for me. But it is still frustrating when I really want to hang out with people and I choose not to because I know I'll be too tired to do so or to last through an activity.

There's a lot more I could say, but that's the gist of it. I'm not here to say I have no hope and I'm at the end of the rope, but I'm definitely frustrated and starting to give up (and not to go on, but Covid isn't helping). I'm usually a positive person and I don't like to complain (my life is very blessed in terms of having a place to live, being employed, etc.). But having gone through so many people who I thought would be friends and who ended up just drifiting away for various reasons has made me cynical. And I really love my boyfriend and I know that he enjoys spending time together, but he does have his own friends and I worry that I will become annoying if I don't have a friend group of my own. Any words whether it just be agreement or advice or whatever, I'm open to hear (literally just came on here to rant).",1,"the person feels disconnected from friends and has lost touch with most of them after graduating. they only have their boyfriend for regular interaction and are struggling to form new connections due to various constraints like work, covid, and personal health issues. their narrative expresses a sense of isolation and frustration with their social situation, indicating loneliness."
"I hate going out alone??.The reason why I hate going out alone is because it a cruel reminder that I??m always alone, a nobody and I always see a group of friends, wishing that was me in the group. I already lost my motivation to work on myself because I??ll never had real close friendship in life and feel like thing won??t get any better for me",1,"the person is lonely because they express a deep sense of isolation and longing for companionship. they feel like a ""nobody"" and are constantly reminded of their loneliness when they see groups of friends. this has led to a loss of motivation and a belief that things won't improve for them."
"Just tired of feeling lonelyI'm so tired of feeling alone and feeling unnecessary. I feel like a ghost because no one sees me or acknowledges me, it's like I don't exist at all. All I want is to feel loved and appreciated. I like conversation but I can't find anyone to have a decent conversation with. I hate feeling alone in this world!",1,"the person describes feeling invisible and unacknowledged, expressing a deep desire for love and appreciation. they mention an inability to find meaningful conversations and a strong sense of isolation, indicating a profound sense of loneliness"
I??m the most awkward person to ever liveAll threw high school I never had any real friends I was always the kid who sat there and never says anything because I never knew what to talk about.  Nobody ever texted me even still to this day. I have never been in a relationship.  I have never got asked to hang out by my ??friends.?? I feel like I??ve never lived a fulfilled childhood. Every year my as my birthday passes peoples wishes slowly shrink one person at a time which makes me realize how alone I really am. I don??t talk to my own family because  I??m to shy to express myself to even them. I have a job but never know what to say to my co workers my voice freezes in my throat as I try to talk it??s the worst thing I ever felt. All my ??friends?? went to college and I have never heard from them since. I haven??t gone to college because I??m afraid to live alone and communicate with new people. I feel complete lost in life and it makes it worse when you literally have nobody to talk to about it.  Ps I??m not suicidal so that??s at least one positive,1,the person feels isolated and disconnected from others they mention a lack of real friends throughout high school no communication with family and difficulty interacting with coworkers they express feelings of being alone and unfulfilled highlighting a deep sense of loneliness
"17M Never had a friend, but I want one. Don't know how to make one.I have never texted, snapped, DM'd, facetimed or phoned anyone. I've never been to a party or gone out for dinner. I've never had a girlfriend or done much more than talk to a girl. I don't hang out with anyone, or talk outside school. I'm a loner and I'm getting tired of it.

I'm unbelievably lucky. I was born in the best city in Canada, if not the world, to an upper-middle-class family and go to a great school. I grew up in a great neighbourhood, and as a kid, I would spend hours outside with my only friend catching lizards in nets and jumping on his trampoline. When I started middle school we grew apart and stopped talking. Even though we still go to the same school, we don't know each other anymore. I only ever had him as a friend, and when I lost that friendship, I never made a new one. I don't want to be friends with him again, as it has been almost a decade, and we are not in the same place socially.

As a senior in high school, I am awfully lonely. I have a few people I talk to and sit with at lunch, but I am an outsider, and just tag along. I have a few people I chat to in school, but otherwise, I'm pretty much a loner. I'm not ugly and I don't have bad hygiene. I'm not socially awkward or cringy. I'm self-aware and take social cues. Every day I watch my peers grow older and experience all the teenager things, first love, first kiss, first girlfriend, first break up. I'm getting tired of seeing people enjoying life with their friends while I sit on the sidelines.

People in my grade are going to parties and hanging with friends. On Instagram, I see pictures of all the people in my school doing cool shit with their friend's: camping, fishing, swimming at the beach or skiing. Parties are practically live-streamed, and I'm writing this while my feed is overflowing with the latest pictures of the parties my peers are at. The people in my grade look amazing, they go to the gym they are fit and healthy. The girls look like models, and the guys look like adults. I'm by no means ugly, but definitely look young for my age, skinny and average height.

I don't think loneliness would have hurt this much before social media. Everything I see hurts. People wishing each other happy birthday on Instagram, while on my birthday I wake up to my school alarm and a text from mom. I see Snapchat stories of the girl I like snorting coke off a table, and boys shitting in the urinal. As stupid as all that is it sure beats being lonely. Trump is president, the forests are burning, oceans rising, and I'm about to die from god damned coronavirus because some idiots couldn't help but eat a bat because it's a trend. What good is there in the world because I can't find it.

I'm tired of sitting in my room on the weekend listening to Radiohead and wallowing in my loneliness, while across the city my peers are living it up. I try to put myself out there, I played soccer for the school, I run a club, I volunteer and get good grades apart from in English. I'm going to university next year for engineering. It is a big school in a big city. People tell me life will change in college, but I don't see how. In high school I'm surrounded by people my age, who are going through the exact same experiences I am. University is no different if I can't make friends now what is going to change.

I don't see the point anymore, I feel like I'm living for my family, not myself. People tell me to find god, but if god existed why the fuck would he make me like this. What is the point of waking up every morning to go to school or work just to die in 80 years, if I'm lucky? I used to only feel the loneliness mentally, it weighed on me like a brick every day, but now I'm feeling it physically. I wake up exhausted, I feel weak, I don't have an appetite and I can't sleep. I've realized that loneliness is more than emotion, it is a disease. I'm in a race to make a friend before the loneliness consumes me. I feel like I am racing against time, but I don't know the race track.

tl;dr how do i make a friend.",1,"the person is lonely because they express a profound sense of isolation and longing for social connections. despite efforts to engage in activities like soccer, running a club, and volunteering, they have not formed meaningful friendships. their narrative is filled with comparisons to peers who are enjoying life, which intensifies their feelings of loneliness and exclusion. they also mention physical symptoms of loneliness, indicating its severe impact on their well-being."
"I've had this issue all my life, and throughout it, it's only gotten increasingly worse.I know there are a lot of vent posts, so I don't expect anyone to see this. But i've been in this predicament all my fucking life. 

All of my life, ever since elementary even, I've always wanted to care and spend time with someone special. I have had 3 relationships in my life, and all of them were failures because the other person never actually liked me that much. And after each one, I would question what the fuck was wrong with me, and I still wonder if theres something wrong with me. I would try to hug them, I would hang out with them, I would try to have conversations with them and if they didn't like anything I would back off and give them space. The only thing I didn't do was act like a fucking robot and go ""would you like, a, hug?"" Whenever the time was appropriate. 

And now, after all of those failed relationships, and the fact that I can't even try to make friends or find a partner without being looked at like an alien due to quarantine makes my me hurt more than ever. As im writing this, it feels like someone's ACTUALLY tugging on my heart strings, and I just want to curl up and cry. 

I used to make up fake scenarios in my head and play them out like a story for fun, or when my mind just won't shut up. But now, I fantasize about characters that I somehow grow feelings for (i've never fucking had that happen), and imagine them comforting me, listening to me, and even letting me take care of them. I write these stories in my head so I can feel happy for 10 minutes, and then have to remind myself and replay a part in the story to feel happy again.

I feel like im on the brink of insanity or even fucking Depression: Electric boogaloo, Highschooler edition.

I live in a small town, so that makes it even harder to meet someone. Because I remember everyone's faces.

I just want to fucking co-exist with someone. Sorry for the trash rant.",1,the narrative clearly depicts a person experiencing profound loneliness they express a lifelong struggle with forming meaningful relationships and their current isolation exacerbates their feelings of despair their use of vivid language and emotional depth underscores their sense of being disconnected from others and their need for companionship and understanding
"what way should I thinkI am kind of lonely in my life in a way but I do have friends also to whom I can easily talk some of the stuff. My best friend went on a date yesterday and she seems quite serious about it they have been talking for many months and I think it is going to be this time some real love stuff.

I am happy for here but some part of it just made me sad I don't want her to date anyone because then I will not have anyone to talk to. slowly each one of my friends has started dating and I notice that whenever a guy comes into any of my friends' life the priorities change they no longer want to hang out the way we would earlier do. To this stupid love, I have lost many friends who now are only available for small talk and always feels like I am taking their time.

ofc I will let go this time also. it is her life but just that I can sense a friendship break up sooner or later makes me a little sad.

Any advice on this would really help.",1,the person feels lonely because they express sadness and concern over losing friends to romantic relationships they worry about not having anyone to talk to and sense an impending friendship breakup they feel left out and their friends' changing priorities contribute to their loneliness

"Lonely but happily sadI have reached a point where I'm okay with being lonely, no one cares about me, no one asks for me, no friends, no future family, nothing.
I'm okay with all of that but, I know there are always a but, I don't want to be okay with all of that. I hate that I'm okay I hate that feeling so much.
 I wish that someday I can find someone that cares about me. I hate when I see best friends, a couple, a mother with her son/daughter. Seeing them happy make me feel like I'm so not worth it, I can't find the right word that can describe how I feel.",1,"the person feels a deep sense of loneliness as they mention having no friends, no future family, and no one who cares about them. despite saying they are okay with it, they express a strong desire for companionship and feelings of worthlessness when seeing others happy in relationships. these sentiments clearly indicate loneliness"
"Life isn't and will likely never be OK. I guess I'll just have to live with that (19M)So today was a pretty OK day, and by that I mean it was terrible. Living with my parents and dealing with this whole pandemic has been even worse on my mental health. At least when I was in college I could pretend it was the stress that resulted in poor mental health, but now with nothing around me I know it's just me and that's just making it worse. I don't really have many good friends, and the ones that I think I have rarely if ever talk to me. I haven't talked to most of my college friends at all since March when this all started. Nobody seems to want to reach out and talk to me which is fantastic. On top of that, I'm in a new state since my parents moved and I know absolutely nobody here and can't make friends even if I wanted to since I'm stuck inside all day, every day, since March. My parents don't talk to me at all really. For example my dad didn't say a single word to me today, and my mom talked to a grand total of 3 times, 1) asking about where my dad was, 2) telling me there's donuts, and 3) telling me to check the mail. So I got a solid 20 seconds of someone in my house actually acknowledging my existence today which is better than usual I guess. So yeah, I have no one to talk to most of the time, no friends here or to call, my parents ignore me, and as a result I'm super lonely. Oh, and also I'm pretty sure I've had depression for years but I haven't seen anyone about it since idk how to start that conversation and I can't afford to see someone anyway. If anyone wants to be friends feel free to pm me, but if you're gonna ghost me then don't bother.",1,the person is experiencing significant loneliness due to several factors they mention feeling isolated both physically and emotionally they are living with their parents who barely acknowledge them they have no friends in their new location and their previous friends from college do not reach out the pandemic has exacerbated their sense of isolation and they express a deep sense of hopelessness and unaddressed mental health issues all these elements contribute to their loneliness
"I have no words to express the bullshit I witnessed and the stress I feelI can't help people who don't want to be helped, why do even try anymore? I go sleep lonely and unsatisfied with my life. All I wanted to do was help, but of course the annoying guy had to show up. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters, amirite? I wish I could hang myself and have everyone forget about me. I wish there was some magic spell to wipe me off everyone's mind so I could just disappear completely. I can't confide in anyone, I can't trust anyone, I need to keep this pain inside. Only thing I think about is when Hans is revealed as the villain in Frozen and he says ""If only there was someone out there who loved you."" If I open up, I'm just going to lose friends again. I don't wanna be alive.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness and despair, feeling isolated and unable to confide in or trust others. they express a deep sense of dissatisfaction with their life and a desire to disappear, indicating a significant level of emotional pain and loneliness."
I??m a liarI lied on Reddit and ghosted someone after getting ghosted myself. I??m in a loveless marriage just to take care of the kids during COVID. I love her and lied and threw her away.

It??s my loss!,1,the narrative clearly shows feelings of loneliness the person admits to being in a loveless marriage and feeling lonely they also express regret and self-blame for their actions indicating a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain
"I can??t trust people.. nor myselfPeople have always misused my trust and it??s fine I guess. It??s my fault for being naive and allowing anyone into my life in the first place and believing that this person might be different and we can be good friends. But nope. 
And then I can??t trust myself as I don??t know what I am cabal of doing. I am a self conscious person and I know my short comings. I am not perfect. 
I want to apologise for those who are genuinely good people and do care about me but due to my trust issues everyone is blacklisted.",1,"the person feels lonely due to their inability to trust others and themselves. they express regret and self-blame for their trust issues, leading to isolation and a sense of being unable to form meaningful connections. they acknowledge that there are genuinely good people around them, but their trust issues prevent them from forming bonds, reinforcing their loneliness."
"Anyone else tiredof like.. superficial consolations.

Not that they don't clearly mean well and perhaps work for some receivers, but.

""All of you are actually loved"" bro I literally have no one. I get that some lonely people do have caring friends/family but I literally have zero and the idea of a stranger loving just the idea of me is just.. unhelpful? Makes me feel almost worse? ""You'll eventually be loved"" would be relatively better but it's still not... much of anything, to me personally. Because love takes mutual work and love can fade and I for one am a mess that has never not incidentally ruined a friendship and/or potential friendship.

I mean I suppose I did come here seeking some kind of solace. It has slightly helped to know I'm not the only one who's felt/experienced certain things. But largely.. I don't know anymore. It's not like I'd want a new bond from here forged solely out of sympathy/pity either. I already have superficial connections. I just... 

I guess this is just a vent.

I don't even think venting is working anymore, especially since many of my issues with keeping friends (always keeping, because making them is hard but relatively much easier) are the result of real life barriers barely in my control, but.

"Holiday LonelinessHi all, first post ever here so go easy on me. 
I spend the holidays alone because my family is completely broken. I??ve spent plenty of holidays sitting alone in my apartment crying.

And does anyone have any advice on making it through the holidays a little easier? Thanks much.",1,"the individual describes spending holidays alone and feeling emotional distress during these times. they mention a broken family and express a sense of isolation, particularly during significant holidays. this indicates feelings of loneliness."
"Friends making plansI was recently in a call with my friends, and they started discussing their plans while I was in the call between them and some other friends, it was really awkward. It just made me a little sad. One of the friends in that call had asked me if I was invited to the other friends birthday celebration. I wasn??t. I have friends, yet I feel so alone.",1,"the person feels lonely because despite having friends, they are excluded from plans and social events, leading to feelings of isolation and sadness"
"Just need to tell somebodyIt doesn't feel like I've got any friends. I had a girlfriend but that relation ended about a month ago. After moving in together in a new city, away from where I've spent most of my life. A little over two years spent with her and looking back, I mainly stayed with her because she was a safe connection to the world.   


I have friends but none of them write to me. Then again, I dont write to them either.   
I used to have a group of friends but people started to move away, get married, have kids. They are all a lot older than me (I'm 30 and they're about 5-10 years older). I didn't do enough to foster the relationship and as people started to move away, I just lost contact.   
Now I'm in a new city, doing my Ms.C. and so far the only friends I've made are in my muay thai gym. The problem is that when we leave the gym, I dont really speak with them. They've all got their own lives and I dont know what to do in order to make a connection, I not sure if they even want to and I dont feel secure in my ability to gauge it.  
I feel disconnected from the world and I dont really know how to make any meaningful connections. 

I have no NYE plans, even though I asked my friends in my home town if they had room for me but people aren't home or they've got other plans.   
I'm good with women and have been using Tinder to hook up regularly with different women but I dont feel any connection. They're just validation and something to do.   
I miss having friends and having fun. I have nobody to talk to about being sad or lonely or frustrated. It's been like this for ages and I dont feel comfortable talking to the people I know because I dont know if they want to listen.   
I dont want to involve the women I date in my issues. I just wish I had a friend to text and say ""hey, I'm having a shit day, wanna do something?"" - But I dont and I don't know if I ever will.   


I feel like a failure and I feel unhelpable. With COVID lockdowns shutting down the night life, I dont know what to do.   
People dont expect this of me. I used to work as a bartender, I currently work in healthcare and I'm used to talking to people and making them feel at ease. I can usually get anybody to open up about their lives. I just dont feel any connection to them.  
I feel alone surrounded by people and most days I just think about not being here any more. It just seems easier to not be here, atleast there is some certainty in that. 

I have a hard time finding joy in anything. I used to game alot but started prioritizing Uni over that but after the break-up, I had a hard time focusing on studying at home but I couldn't find any pleasure in gaming anymore. Nothing really makes me happy anymore.  
Muay thai is a great passion of mine but ever since moving up the fight team, I just feel useless and talentless. I get my ass kicked in sparring because I'm the newbie and most of them have a lot of fights under their belt.   
It's so demotivational not being able to do anything and I just lose confidence in my ability.   
I already hate myself plenty but atleast I had some confidence in muay thai but that's fading quickly.  


Exams are next month and I'm just apathetic. I normally have extreme anxiety about exams but I'm just so empty inside that I can't even feel that. Some days I'm not even sure I exist to anybody and that's probably the most lonely feeling there is.

I dont know what I'm expecting from this post.

"My only friends are fictional charactersThis sounds weird, but genuinely right now, and for a while, it feels like the only people I have in my life are fictional characters. 

I'm 19F, and have always been told I'm a likeable, intelligent, fun, ambitious person who would make a great friend. I've been told by the friends I've had in the past that I'm a kind, loving person and always have the best intentions. 

But for the past six years or so, it's seemed like making friends has become extremely difficult. I only have one friend right now, and that relationship is seeming to fade too. I was talking to a guy I was interested in for awhile, the first one after having an abusive relationship a few years ago, but he recently seemed like he came up with an excuse to stop talking to me. It feels like with genuinely everyone I try with I get rejected. 

I have a tendency to become obsessed with media I like , and right now it feels like some characters in a show I like are my only friends. Like I actually have a connection to them and have been there with them throughout their journeys. (I'm aware it's fictional just as an fyi) 


I escape into their world so much it feels like I'm there and a part of their adventures, but when I get out of that mindset and realize I'm as lonely as I am I become very depressed. 

It's as if I lost someone. And I so badly wish they were real and my friends.

"I don??t know what to doHello everyone,
I don??t really feel like putting my name here because of privacy but here we go. I??m a 17 year old boy just to let you guys know.
But I??m so lonely and depressed
Throughout my life I??ve always been taught to be nice to other and treat them with respect and others will do the same. I have a good amount of friends but I don??t feel like they are now after I think about it. I have been one of the bigger kids growing up and I??m not in terrible shape but not the best. But anyway these people just call me all these names, and it??s almost everyday. Shrek, ogre, fatass and a lot more are the main ones. It sucks because I give them everything I got. I don??t think they love me as much as I have loved them. I would die for them, but I don??t think they would do the same and that??s what truly hurts. I??m so tired of being nice to these people just to get insulted. They say they??re just joking but they don??t get what it??s doing. It makes me feel so bad about myself. Like I am the problem and if I fix it maybe they will stop. But it??s hard. I try to lost weight but it doesn??t come easy. I just wanna be loved by someone you know? That kinda goes into the loneliness. I just wanna love someone for the rest of my life that loves me for me. It??s so tough to get through the day without thinking badly about myself. I have thought about suicide before but I don??t think I could do that. I thought about calling the suicide prevention hotline but i don??t know. It??s a lot easier to talk about this in person so i apologize for my lackluster writing. Anyway, I also feel like a failure and that I will also be a failure. I??m bored with my life but don??t feel like I will find a purpose. I??ve been called a simp before for just trying to be nice. It??s basically bad to be nice to someone from where I am. I wanna just cry it out but I can??t. I want to talk to people but I can??t. I don??t know what to do can I have some help",1,the person is experiencing significant loneliness despite having friends they feel unappreciated and misunderstood they express a deep desire for genuine love and connection but face constant bullying and disrespect this leads to feelings of isolation depression and worthlessness they struggle with self-esteem and have even considered suicide indicating profound emotional distress and a lack of supportive relationships
"Oxytocin spraysI was thinking that most of my problems stem from or are exacerbated by a lack of human connection in my life and by extension, a lack of the hormone, oxytocin.

Anyone ever tried them?",1,the narrative clearly indicates feelings of loneliness as the person expresses a lack of human connection which they believe is causing or worsening their problems. their consideration of using oxytocin nasal spray to address this issue further underscores their sense of isolation and desire for social interaction.
"How I would like to live in the past once moreSince the beginning of the year, I have tried to do many things such as being able to improve myself, but after a few personal constraints as I stopped losing interest in everything I considered a hobby, I saw the instagram posts of those who called "" friends "", but then I realized that they were only with me for convenience. I know that sometimes I get to be serious and dry at times but sometimes I find it difficult to express myself as well as being able to open up to someone but when I open up to a person, they are the first to hurt me as well as get away with it. The only person who loved me as I was left me a few days ago and I miss her a lot. Sometimes I think about what to do but the anxiety and loneliness reaches such a point that I just want to look at the ceiling and listen to the rain fall. I hate how it is that the great moments I do not appreciate at all and the thoughts like the illusions of finding someone are already null and also that something always goes wrong, I just think what would happen if tomorrow I left this world and the simple fact of to be in a better world than my imagination can recreate, I am agnostic so the truth is I do not believe much in those things besides that I have had problems with my family about it. So the only friends I have is an imaginary friend and a lobster plush that brings back good memories. I could never imagine that I would end up in an endless cycle of pain in which everyone abandons me and the most important ones disappear overnight.

"Void in my chest. TW: Self-HarmI feel empty. This loneliness is consuming me and it literally feels like there is a void in my chest. A part of my heart is missing. I lost a friendship that left me fulfilled. I lost the feelings of closeness, connectedness, and security. I felt understood, cared for, and appreciated. I lost something that was good for my well-being. I feel so devastated. I feel even lonelier after losing that friendship that I have urges to self-harm again. My friend was like a best friend to me, except I only saw it as a close friendship. I'd have these depressive thoughts and it makes me want to beat myself up because it was my fault why I lost that friendship. The loneliness is so painful that I want to self-harm again. Physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain. I miss being able to talk to my friend about the ups and downs of my life. I miss spending time with my friend.

There's probably no point to this, and I'll probably delete this post, but for this moment at least I have to spill my thoughts out.  
I'm fucking dying from loneliness, isolation, and boredom. For context, I do have social anxiety and while that has made me do extreme things at times (literally run out of a gym because they needed a picture of me), I'm basically functional. I'm in grad school and have a job. When I'm in those settings and have something to talk about, I can talk. There's other situations where I'm basically okay, but when it comes to just being conversational with a stranger for no reason, I can't do it.  
Not that any of that even matters. I have tried EVERYTHING I can possibly do on my end of things to make friends and nothing has worked. The key word here is FRIENDS. I've never had much trouble finding a boyfriend (if you're an okay-looking girl and are on Tinder, it's really not hard to find a dude who'll take the time to get to know you because he knows he'll get to smash in the end. Women ignore me though--bisexual/lesbian dating is like pulling teeth. But I digress). Anyway, point is, I have a boyfriend, and we're basically attached at the hip, but it's not enough. He's desperate for friends too, and I want him to have that. We both deserve connections outside of each other. But with the way things are going, we might as well be the last two people on earth surrounded by vaguely people-looking things that sometimes talk to us but never connect with us.   
Before anyone starts hitting me with some advice I've already heard 10 billion times, let me just list everything I've tried to make friends/treat my social anxiety in order to make friends. 

1. tinder
2. bumble
3. okcupid (back in the day when it was cool) 
4. A writing meetup group
5. a social anxiety/depression meetup group (might've worked out but it disbanded after like 2 meetings)
6. my college's lgbt club 
7. my college's vegan club
8. activism
9. volunteer work
10. staying in shape/dressing well/basically looking good so people won't treat me like a goddamn leper 
11. talked to a random person at my college's stupid 'heyday' event
12. going to coffee shops/bars/etc alone and hoping to CHRIST that some person just fucking acknowledges i exist (best result: an old couple felt sorry for me at the bar and talked to me for about five minutes before leaving).
13. meditation 
14. journaling
15. mindfulness
16. religion/spirituality
17. focusing on myself and my hobbies so i dont spiral into this exact mood i'm having right now oh wait too late 
18. four different therapists
19. three different medications 
20. and a partridge in a fucking pear tree  


I hear you asking ""why didn't any of those things work out"". Well, I'm a psych grad so going to therapy is like watching a play except the lights never go down, so you can see all the set pieces moving and all the costume changes. I know what they're going to say to me, and it's all redundant and unhelpful. As for the meds, I don't know, I'm not a med person. They just didn't work.   
The social stuff mainly boils down to living in a shitty fucking Southern state in the year of our lord 2019 where no one looks up from their fucking phones, so even the people who AREN'T socially anxious don't know how to talk to anyone anymore, and even if they did talk to me, we'd have nothing in common because my beliefs are so radically different from everyone else's (except my boyfriend, the ONE person in the world who agrees with me on anything). I definitely don't fit in with the conservative majority, but I don't fit in with the liberals or anyone else either.   
There are SO many things I can't talk about with people or have no interest in talking about. Like I can't talk about politics because of the aforementioned differences in beliefs (and I mean MAJOR differences, and no, I don't want to 'discuss our differences' because I've tried that shit and it just leads to arguments and I know no one's mind is going to change anyway so its a huge headache and waste of time).   
I also can't talk about a lot of innocuous surface-level stuff because quite frankly, I don't CARE about the fucking Office or Game of Thrones or Snapchat or whatever the fuck everyone is so obsessed with. Oh, Just talk about MY interests then? Sure, let me bore you to death with my comparison of three different versions of Victor Hugo's *Notre Dame de Paris*, and ooohhh you're already out the door. Do I have any popular interests? Sure, I'm into *Star Wars*, but probably not the way you're into it. How? Oh, nothing, it's just the sequel trilogy is my favorite and----oh, bad opinion alert, off you go!   


I'm trying to accept that all the love I'll ever have is between me and my partner. I know I'm lucky to even have that, and I shouldn't ask for anything more, but that doesn't stop me from crying at least three times a week because he's busy at work and I'm home alone with nothing to do and no one to see and nothing else to live for. I'm really not looking for advice here, because I seriously don't think there's anything left for me to try. I just wanted to spill my guts into the void and be angry and lame and feel sorry for myself, I guess. Whatever. You can make fun of me if you want or tell me I'm being ""negative"". Have at it. I don't care.   


Sorry you had to read this, if you made it this far. Hope your life is going better than mine, that you have popular interests, popular opinions, and live somewhere cool where things happen and people aren't all carbon copies of each other constantly chanting ""it gets better"" with no proof that it actually does.

I went through a horrible breakup not too long ago, and I used to have a best friend that I??ve been friends with since childhood and when I never expected it she ghosted me a few months back. I thought of her like family. It was so much loss in a short span of time. 

I feel so depressed. I??m trying to get back into therapy, I feel so alone. But I don??t want to need someone to feel okay, I want to feel fine alone. But I have no idea how to do it.

Social anxiety makes it even worse. I hate to admit it, but I??m really bad at socializing too. I??m exhausted, upset, and bored. It??s what I feel like almost every weekday. I wish I had at least one bff that we stick together no matter what. I wish I could make friends. This summer, I know I??ll be alone like always. I??ll just be waiting in my house, waiting for tomorrow to come, then the next day and the next day and so on, until I have to go be lonely in public again.",1,"the narrative indicates a deep sense of isolation and lack of meaningful connections. the person expresses feelings of being used by their current friends and a belief that they are unlikable. they also mention social anxiety and difficulty socializing, contributing to their loneliness. their anticipation of spending the summer alone and their repetitive, monotonous days further highlight their sense of isolation and loneliness."
"What did I do?So back in October I decided to take a break from alcohol.  Major binge drinker here.  I'm super proud of myself for sticking with it but some things that have happened because of quitting have me super sad and depressed.  I feel like all my friends have stopped talking to me.  No one invites me places and I CAN be around people drinking and have just as much fun.  Found out yesterday that a bunch of people I hung around went camping and I wasn't invited.  Maybe I wasn't as well liked as I thought.  Or maybe it has nothing to do with me but damn I feel like my heart is broken.  

I've always struggled with friendships.  I've got alot of anxiety and I don't process emotions very well.  Mine and other people's.  Any advice?  I'm not going to drink just to keep fun friends.

"I'm 27 and haven't ever had a steady girlfriendRidiculed by so called friends in school, but was too oblivious to realise it at the time. When I did realise, tried to shed the people pleasing attitude. So dived into drugs and didn't care about much else. I've been with some amazing women, dates, hookups here and there but nobody really cared about me and that really hurt. 

I dont matter to any girl in my life, I'm always the one chasing. I match with women on dating apps but it the excitement fades away soon. It's as if they realise how much of a boring loser I am just from 3-4 text exchanges. 

Most of my male friends only meet to drink and smoke, and I've been drifting away because I'm trying to cut down personally. So there's that.",1,"the person feels lonely because they express a lack of meaningful connections both romantically and socially. they mention not having a steady girlfriend, feeling ridiculed by friends, and having superficial relationships that fade quickly. they also feel unimportant to women and are drifting away from male friends due to lifestyle changes."
I miss my ex in moments like thisI??m watching Tom Segura stand up. He has this bit about his friend wanting to blow someone in WuTang. My ex would??ve loved this.

"Pathetic People PleaserI learned something today. I thought I was a good person deserving of love, and now I wonder if I even know what that is. I was a dutiful daughter, faithful wife, loving mother, and hard worker, and I might be these things, but I??m alone. 

I??ve always taken care of my parents. My husband is avoidant and our love is ritual, not felt, and I can??t help but dream about real love through stupid Limerence. I??m often away from my kids, and they are almost full grown. I suck at my jobs, definitely not a work smarter type of person. Might be too smart to see the simple solution.  I have much to be grateful for, and this helps to find possibility, but I feel like I will always be a burden. 

I work so hard to please others that I lost myself, and I realized no one could really love me since in a lot of ways, I don??t love or care for myself. I denied it when people brought it up, and people try to be kind to me since I??m nice, but at a point, I can??t be helped. 

You can care so much for others, be so cable of loving and wanting to see them happy, the worst feeling in the world is realizing they might be happier without you. It??s a paradox. You can??t be full of love and not love yourself, because then you can??t really love others if you don??t love yourself, because deep down, they always know.

This is my loneliness. 

I deserve to be alone. 

I won??t give up, but maybe the acceptance of this will help me move forward.",1,the person feels isolated despite fulfilling many roles in life they express a deep sense of inadequacy and a belief that they are a burden they mention their husband is emotionally distant and their love feels empty they are often away from their children and struggle with self-worth this self-awareness of their loneliness and lack of self-love contributes to their feelings of being undeserving of love
"Lonely in the evenings, advice needed pleaseI can make it through the day but come the evening I feel really lonely and anxious. I've found not having anyone to talk to quite difficult, but I'm finding a lack of intimacy as a result of the UK lockdown especially difficult (my love language is touch).

My girlfriend has asked we go on a break because things are so difficult at the moment, and I have no family to talk to because they are so toxic (I've had to fight to not fall back on them because of how detrimental to my mental health it will be). My few friends are with family so are unavailable to talk to, and obviously they can't help with the intimacy issue.

"Everyone feels lonely for different reasons but at the center of it I think there's a lack of opportunitiesI can't speak for everyone but I personally feel lonely because I'm never invited anywhere. I feel more and more isolated by the day and it's bordering on not having anyone TO invite me anyplace. It becomes sort of this domino effect because when this happens you get further and further from socializing and closer to isolation. 
I'm not socially awkward but I firmly believe loneliness is totally avoidable if everyone were just given a chance. 
Imagine a party for just lonely people? Regardless of age, gender, cultural differences, etc. I think if we got all the folks in here into one room we'd be able to come together as a team and have a great time making lasting relationships. Intellectual conversation. Camaraderie. Laughs. Potential love interest. All the stuff that makes life worth living that we've unfortunately lost sight of.
The problem is we don't have the opportunity to make those choices. Everything feels so limited. It's truly heartbreaking.

"I keep hearing that it??ll get better, but it only ever seems to get worse.It seems to be impossible for me to add people into my life. Maybe for most people ??people come and go??, but for me they only seem to go. I could go on and on about specific cases, but to paraphrase all of them, nobody seems to like me.

I noticed around two or three years ago that my circle was getting smaller and smaller, and I figured that had to be my fault somehow. I decided to make changes. I made changes to my attitude to be a more positive and likable person, I made changes to the way I spoke to sound like less of an asshole, I made changes to my lifestyle to be healthier, the list goes on... And nothing has changed. Nothing has changed in the slightest, my circle has gotten so small that it now barely includes my immediate family.

As I just said, I try my hardest to always stay positive and be somebody that people want to be around. It??s getting exhausting. It??s getting exhausting, and I have nothing to show for it. I have so few opportunities to actually make friends and get dates. Every chance I get, I always knock it out of the park. I don??t think there??s a single person that??s talked to me for more than 10 minutes that doesn??t like me. I always hear that it??s not me, it??s everyone else. That sounds so arrogant to me. I have to be the problem. I??m the one that always ends up alone, not everyone else.

But if I am the problem, what about me is the problem? Like I said, I??ve been constantly trying to improve myself wherever I can. I feel like I??m currently 10 times the man I was this time last year, yet I feel even more lonely than I was back then. I don??t know how much longer I can keep this up. I just want to have someone in my life that will tell me I??m doing a good job.

The thing is, they are beautiful and have had between 3 and 5 relationships, some really serious. They always have multiple guys in their DMs and just crushing on them. And me? Im a 21 yo weird penguin who is just ""the ugly friend"". Ive never had a relationship, never have guys wanting me... 

For example, Im in several classes with one of them. We basically are a pair, we spend the breaks together (with other people ofc) and everyone knows we are besties. And still, in every single class we have, there is a guy who starts following her on instagram and texts her and no one ever does it to me. 

They are always talking about guys and their exes and their sex lives (which is normal for 21 yo girls) and I always feel very left out, because I can only say ""yes, remember when I made out with that random foreigner once"" and literally have nothing more to say.

"I feel like I've missed out on too much already19m here. I'm relieved I managed to find a place to vent on reddit, and that there are more people like me, selfish as that is. I just finished my first year of college and it was probably the most lonely year of my entire life. I was able to make at least a few friends, but pretty much all of them have other main friend groups that I'm not a part of and I feel like I'm just a peripheral character in everybody else's life. I told myself that I would just have to take the time to adjust to college life, but most of it consisted of sitting in my dorm room alone. I was unwell both physically and mentally and was just so depressed that I seemed to have been barred access to the kind of rosy college life that everybody around me was able to enjoy effortlessly. I just recently made the decision to go back to school in-person instead of staying at home, but some days I just get that sinking feeling in my stomach and regret that feeling so much. I wanted to come back to get another change at making friends but I'm scared that I'm just making the same mistake I made when I decided to come to this out of state school in the first place and I'll be just as miserable as I was in my first year, or even more so, given the quarantine procedures and how hard it'll be to make friends and meet people because of that. I never really learned how to make friends growing up, I always just had one close friend throughout all of elementary middle and high school and I just became friends with his friends instead of making my own. Now that I'm back home and quarantining, I think they are all hanging out without me, I see them playing together on steam all the time and so it looks like they went and made a new discord server without me as well because the one that I'm on has been inactive since march. I always thought that no matter what happened when I was away at college I would always have them to come back to at home, but oh well. I knew that I'd manage to push them away eventually, it just took a longer time than usual. All of my friends that I made throughout my childhood are now either out of my life or leaving it rapidly. Some of my closest childhood friends I haven't talked to in 5 or 6 years. All the friends I initially thought I'd made at college also started to exclude me even in the first week, I thought I was part of their group but they just split off and left me alone.

I feel like something inside me just broke since I left high school and made it impossible for me to truly connect with any other person, I feel like there's just something fundamentally wrong with me sometimes and that's why everybody I see is able to just easily make friends with everybody else, but when they talk to me they can see the brokenness, they can see that I'm less trustworthy, or that I'm just a shitty person, subconsciously, and they avoid me as a result. I don't know why I ever left my home, I should have just gone to my state's university like everybody close to me did. I even had to break up with my hs girlfriend when I left to go to college out of state and she's ghosting me now too. I don't know how to wrap this up, but I just wish I could be normal. I wish people treated me like they treat everyone else instead of acting so guarded and wary. I don't even think I'm that unattractive, it's just purely my vibes I guess. I wish I was approachable. I wish I could have a normal life, and if that means mediocrity or averageness then I'd fully embrace it just so I could be like everybody else instead of having to feel like such a freak all the time. Maybe I'm over dramatizing everything, maybe I made my problems sound worse than they really are. I just don't know. I hope I can figure out how to fix my life before it's too late, I want to spend these years making memories, but I'm not, and that just means that I'm making regrets instead. What I'm most terrified of is looking back on these years when I'm 40 or 50 and realizing that it only ever got harder, so I should have seized these years when I had the opportunity instead of spending them all depressed and lonely, but I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get out of this. I just hope it gets better. I don't want life to stay the same.",1,"the person is experiencing profound loneliness and isolation despite efforts to connect with others. they describe feeling like a peripheral character in others' lives, struggling to make meaningful connections, and feeling excluded by both old and new friends. their narrative is filled with regret, self-doubt, and a sense of missed opportunities, which are classic indicators of loneliness."
I feel like I??m in purgatory.I??m literally trapped inside of my mind all day. No one really understands. I reach out for help and people treat me like i??m asking for too much.

"No friends.I'm a 27 yo male from the UK... I've tried making mates to play xbox with (red dead redemption, dead by daylight etc) and sure I've had people add me but no one will actually play anything.

Just want to have a connection with someone, doesn't have to be romantic just someone I can mess around and have fun with... I really enjoy being silly when I play online games so if we do that then be willing to accept a crazy personality, I literally call random players on rdr ""Blueberries"" coz of their markers on the map and I can get a little odd at time.

Male, female, trans all welcome, gay straight bi doesn't matter to me all welcome and yeah I'm gay but don't care if you use the term gay ""that's so gay"" or call me a fag or whatever.

"Does anyone else feel like they dont know how to Express themselves when talking leading to just being frustrated and drained from it.I'm starting to notice that one reason why I'm feeling lonely is because whenever I do talk to my friends I'm used to having this sarcastic aggressive tone when talking and I'm starting to realize when talking without that tone I'm usually at a loss of words and dont know really how to talk about something without feeling like I'm  hitting a wall leading to me just being quiet and not talking at all.

"'It's important to be able to develop relationships'That's what a counselor I was working with was saying. Despite being in college surrounded by people for 3.5 years, and working with several therapists I made almost no connections at a big school, and it's caused many problems. Forget even having a social life, but no one for support, my parents are falling out of my life so when I depended on them more a year ago that wasn't too good. It's really sad actually, I let all the connections just go away. Even today knowing that I still can't put a foot forward, I just live in frustration. There's no way someone can know me, no one knew me, being alone was the only thing I felt like was myself. But it's not right if you want to function in this world. It's caused a lot of issues, I feel like people use me or I offend them and despite having a good degree I can't even get a job in the right place. I lost everything because of  this problem and I thought I was working on it but I guess I'm still too scared or too reluctant to actually change. It may not be my fault but it is my responsibility. Nobody chooses this but the only way to move forward is to take responsibility. I went to this great, top school with a great degree and no ones going to show up at my graduation. All those hours I spent trying to get employed and I still don't have something to look forward to. My grades plummeted last month but I wasn't partying; I have a top degree but no job; I sought professional help over the last 1.5 years and the root didn't change. Because I did everything but I never shared.

"Advice for Loneliness(duh)(16F) I know what I know and any solutions to my loneliness are only futile. So instead of solutions, I'd like to know if there are any ways to cope and compensate with my loneliness.

There is no way to solve the loneliness, but as the need for human connection has been the only thing on my mind lately I want to know if there are any ways that I can stop this.

I listen to some of the things my bestfriend  says and compare it to me, and it??s saddening.

Today my bestfriend missed school because she feels sick, and she told me how people won??t stop txting and asking her if she??s ok. She told me and someone else she was sick (2 ppl), yet everyone else found out??but when I was sick and I told people no one cared or checked up up on me.

"Recent Breakup, Quarantine, and No Friends or Family NearbyMy boyfriend and I just broke up and it's really fucking with me. We weren't together very long (5 months) but we were very into each other at the beginning. Quarantine came and we realized during it we were different people, and we didn't make sense. So we mutually decided, this doesn't work, we have to break up, we are not happy around each other.

That was last week. I spent the week reading books, speaking virtually to friends, doing meditation, reading Reddit to help with breakup pain. I was feeling really confident and ok with the decision and what we had to do. It made sense.

He came over and we exchanged stuff, and then he stayed and talked. We had a really honest and good conversation. I wish he had communicated like that while we were together. It doesn't change that we are different people, but I finally felt like I was seeing the vulnerability that had gone missing for the past 6 weeks. It made me feel close to him. We left it on good terms, he left, and I completely broke down. 

He has always lived in this town, so he has friends he can distract himself with. He has a car and can drive anywhere. It's his town - so there is comfortability there. I moved here for a job 2 years ago and don't know anyone outside of work, and I can't see anyone from there anyways bc of quarantine, plus as management, I don't think I should really be socializing with them (and cannot create friendships). Prior to quarantine I worked such insane hours there wasn't a chance to meet new people. I have a weird schedule and weird days off, and it makes it difficult to socialize at normal times. Plus work is really exhausting so I usually spend my first day off sleeping just to recuperate. 

After my ex left I realized I am SO alone here. My parents are on the other side of the country, my friends are spread around but no one is here. I literally do not have a single person to call and speak to here. To even see in person when restrictions are lifted. I watched the sunset to remind myself to put things in perspective, and it was so beautiful. And there wasn't anyone I could text that to. My friends have kids and are busy - no one has time to respond or share in the moment.

One of the meditations I did earlier this week was like, talk to your significant other, spend time with the family in your house to reduce anxiety! And I thought - but I am literally and completely alone. Hug who? Talk to who? Play a card game with who?

I am just feeling super low. I couldn't stop crying after he left realizing he goes back to a full social life in his town, and I go back to... nothing. There is not a soul in this town I can hangout with or call. And the aching loneliness is incredibly soul crushing.

"I am alone feeling like screwed up !So its gonna be a long text get set for a ride .I was never the social type of person but i would always had people close to me to hang around and do stuff .From when i was in the age of 12 i would always had a best friend to do literally everything with him .As i was growing up,i kept losing all of my close friends due to their parents job cause they had to transfer to another town ,etc...around highschool after another close friend has  left and basically changed city(living in an island so basically leaving the island its pretty hard to keep in touch with other)i met another guy who was pretty alone and immediately we created a strong bond .As years passed we he kept being my best friend while for 2 years we stopped chatting cause i got into a group with other friends doing stuff that my best friend didn't like cause he was the type of the housecat person.With my new friends we were keeping strong emotions hanging out all the time and doing stuff .Basically here comes the circle again i made a new best friend and after a year he had to leave the cott and basically change country but we kinda kept on touch through gaming .Reaching the age of 18 ot was the time for me to go to a university. First day and i am literally frozen in motion literally cant talk to anyone .I mean i was expecting that to happen but i thought i would have the willpower to manage and talk to anyone . It turned out that my mentality was too weak and ended up viewing mt first class solo on the back seats of the classroom .I was so nervous that my college life could be a huge mess .Second day as i was sitting and watching the lecture some guy came to talk to me ans we started hanging out .several days in and 2 more guys came and we created a group to sit and chat .We hanged a lot doing stuff outside of the university.Basically after a month from the 4 of us the one guy started dissapearing,the second guy transfered to another university and the third guy just gave up the whole college stuff and left so i was once again alone .Entering the class i caught with my eye another guy sitting a row behind me alone .I found the courage to speak with him and we ended up after some chatting becoming best college friends .that guy introduced me to some of his friends and we created another group .Basically the story begins from here.With one of his friends we became pretty close spending all the day with eachother and doing stuff .For some reason we argued and both of our behaviours started to change .He said some stuff as a joke ,i got really angry and i started fading away.i noticed changes in my behavior like i was keeping a big distance from people .i couldnt laugh that easily anymore and started to loose my cool and became a boring person .Summer came and i met my group of friends from where i was living .We were doing stuff all summer and basically it was one of the best summers in my life.i noticed again due to my behavior like i was kinda left out of the good stuff but i didn't have a problem with that cause i just wanted to hang out with someone .the end of the summer comes and its time for my university to starts again.The point is that my friend has announced me that he will leave college life and just come for a week or two for the exams.Then i fell like the depression was started to hitting on me.I spend a lot of time locked in my house watching movies playing video games and eating.I left myself out of control turned onto an obese person and the problems kept railing up.Going to 1 year ago i decided to send a message to my friend from highschool .he answered and we started talking for days about how messed up both of our lives were and how ruined they were by the circumstances of the enviroment we were in and how we slowly destroyed them .
The summer came and we started hanging around with mt friend more .he was pretty closed to himself so i tried to drag him with the group of friends i had but he wasnt in the mood and i respected that.With that group of people i was started to being left out from stuff more and more .i felt like hell watching them randomly all together while i was alone so we started fading .Now o just have that one friend that we rarely do stuff due to him prefering being at home and me feeling so lonelt .I HAD MORE TO WRITE BUT THE THINGS I WROTE ARE ENOUGH TO SEE MY STORY DONT KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME BUT I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM AND HEAR THEIR STORIES .ALSO SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH THEY ARE MY SECOND LANGUAGE !",1,"the person describes a pattern of forming close bonds and then losing those connections due to circumstances beyond their control like friends moving away or losing interest. they mention feeling left out and isolated multiple times, and their behavior and mood deteriorate as a result. they also express a desire to connect with others who might be experiencing similar feelings. this indicates they are experiencing loneliness."
"I have been practically in lockdown since March 2019So, I (17 M) have been practically in lockdown since COVID started spreading worldwide. My family has become very cautious literally with everything and we stay home most of the time. Basically, the only ones that go out are my parents but just if it is extremely necessary. In my own case I??ve gone out less than 10 times maybe (even though I??m already vaccinated, as well as my entire family).

Sometimes I really do feel confused about myself and how I am holding up. After COVID started, my school went online and continued like that for a year, I also went from middle school to high school in this time frame. I just started a new school year two months ago and my school decided to implement a hybrid class system. My family chose online, as well as the majority of other students. However, more people have started to choose going to school (at my school you can decide whether if you are taking online or not each month). Additionally, during the last year or so I have made myself very perfectionist and I must admit I put a lot more effort when it comes to be about school, so it turns into effort and time consuming. Sometimes I have even thought this is my way of coping with the circumstances, and that subconsciously I want to be busy doing something to keep myself away of ??reality??.

Also, I haven??t been able to see any of my friends in ??real-life?? for almost a year and a half, which sometimes makes me feel somewhat lonely and a bit sad. There is also this girl I like a lot, and I think I could even like her. Unfortunately, she moved to a different country than mine, but she may return in a couple of months. The bad thing is that I may not even see her. As mentioned previously my parents are kinda overprotective (of course I really appreciate them caring for my health and well-being), so it is very unlikely that they will let me see basically anyone. There have been lots of occasions in which friends have invited me to hangout and do something, and I really do want to go out with them but I know that my parents will just say no and it is very frustrating. For example, on one occasion one of my closest friends went to study abroad and there was this farewell-party I was invited to, and while mostly everyone was already vaccinated I wasn??t able to attend. 

So, this has been very frustrating for myself and I really feel very lonely deep inside. I??m not the type of person that expresses true feelings frequently and I??m not that emotional as well. Still, I feel desperate, unmotivated and I feel like my life has turned into a boring and monotonous routine(in a sense it has definitely turned like this). I??m afraid that I??ll be having the same reality during 2022. I have 1.5 high school years left and I??m also really afraid I missed out/will miss out all this period of my life.

Edit: Thanks if you took the time to read all of this, I just really wanted to unburden myself.",1,"the person is experiencing significant isolation due to prolonged lockdown measures and overprotective parents. they have not seen friends in person for a year and a half, leading to feelings of loneliness and sadness. their inability to participate in social activities, despite wanting to, contributes to their sense of frustration and monotony. the narrative clearly shows a deep sense of loneliness and desperation."

All I need is someone I can talk to and someone who will fucking care about me and I will do the same for them. But, no, everyone ghosts me. I'm tired of this. I just need someone who won't abandon me even though I'm boring. I mean come on, if I can't entertain you 24 hours, you will just leave me? What does that even mean? Is friend a commodity now?

what if i had a girlfriend. what if she was a scientist, an artist. what would my parents and the people who see us together think. it wouldnt last long, i am emotionally incapable of being close to another person. i have somewhat accepted this. 

i am the silent observer of other peoples lives. i punish myself for trying to get close to anyone, i dont see myself as worthy enough to be in their world. so i observe them from afar and fantasize about me being worthy. 

no matter how illogical, unrealistic our personal fantasies or dreams are, despite all odds, we convince ourselves that we will achieve them one day. that no matter age, cognitive ability, income, people believe in their dreams past their expiration date. this is the essence of the human condition. no matter what you have you will always want more, inexplicable and illogical more. 

brotherhood, human companionship, connection, can only exist through collective suffering. collective suffering is what brings us together, not love. funerals bring us closer together than weddings. the only way we can begin to understand each other is by understanding each other's suffering and where it comes from. 

what am i waiting for? what days do i remember? i spend my life waiting for things to happen, they never do. i spend my life waiting in vain, wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. and it never comes, so you spend your time in vague regret, or vaguer hope that something good will come along. something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. and the truth is, i feel so angry. the truth is, i feel so fucking sad. i felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long ive been pretending im okay. i dont know why. maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery. because they have their own.

And now because of COVID I??m working from home, which I despise, because at least when I was going to work I??d get to socialise with people other than my immediate family but now all I get is Skype conversations (which I don??t think are really the same as face to face interactions.) I??m an extroverted person too so at the minute I??m fucking exhausted and I??m not sure how much longer I can carry on like this. I??m always reluctant to do those online friend apps where you meet people that way because 1. COVID and 2.

"I don't know how to deal with thisHello, 25M here; ever since my breakup (nearly 6 months ago) I have been feeling extremely lonely and I still could not open up to another people. I've been working on myself truly, I've lost weight (102 to 83, still losing), focused more on my work / career, changed some of my habits, started doing things I've never had a chance before. I thought the lack of self-confidence I have was about my weight, but it turned out it was not, I am not a type of person who could go to a cafe and see someone who's sitting alone and talk to them, that is not me. Tried online dating apps, getting judged by pictures before you actually get a chance to talk with them, did not work. It is complicated like, I want to find someone, to love and be loved by someone and but in the meantime I do care about my own personal space more than anything. I don't know if I am still dealing with the breakup, if I am still recovering, maybe I am not ready at all, who knows, 6 months is a short amount of time for someone like me. I just don't know how to be happy by myself, I've always searched happiness in other people, that was the most hardest struggle I've had to dealt with, and I am still trying. But simply I do not know how to deal with this loneliness anymore, like I cannot enjoy anything, I am playing games at night after work, does not help, going out on weekends, does not help, spending time with my family, makes me smile for a short time but the thoughts are still there. Not just talking about relationships, I am also lacking ""female"" in my life like,  I studied among men, been working here for nearly 1.5 years, there's no one to meet, having a simple life, work-home-sleep cycle and during covid the situation became worse, online friendships doesn't last long, I don't know why it ends up with one of the sides getting ghosted. I am open to discussion, or if you guys wanna vent here, feel free to also. I know some of us having the same struggles and we can support each other.

No one has ever wanted to be my friend irl, no one has ever wanted to be my girlfriend, everyone just leaves me even when they say they won??t.

I used to have a lot of friends and kind of enjoyed living as it was. But now, I hardly hear from those people; nobody ever texts me first (it's always me who is trying, and after some time, I just gave up).

Since no one ask me to eat and/or ignore me asking where they are eating I am left to eat alone. Then head to the school library till lunch is over. And everyday I wish I ate with someone.

"Lonely but scared to get close with peopleAll of my past relationships have gone wrong with guys as they have all mugged me off or cheated on me or just plain left me for no good reason. I used to be able to have sex without being too worried about it but now I??m so self conscious about everything. People tell me I??m not fat or ugly but I feel like if guys felt the need to cheat on me or just leave me then it must be because I??m not good enough, right? Well now I don??t know what to do because I hate being lonely and I want to be able to have fun and be flirty etc. And this guy I was really good friends with was telling me he wanted to get sexual with me not in a relationship but just as a friend thing and I know he wouldn??t fuck off because he??s an extremely genuine person etc and I want to let myself get close with him but every time a guy wants to get close with me I get so scared away when I just want to be able to not care and have fun I??m sick of being so frigid and tight and scared to let myself do things, Iv got really bad anxiety and my mind constantly makes me overthink about bad situations or really awkward scenarios which scare me away from being with someone or being sexual with them.

I was doing quite well for a while.  I've relapsed a few times with self-harm but aside from that, I've felt good about life. I don't like hanging out with people all the time and I kinda like quarantine because I have a good excuse to avoid others (self-isolation isn't mandatory where I am). 

I have a boyfriend. I have a good friend group and we're always chatting together. I'm not on my own but I feel like I am. I want to see friends now and then but I'm not allowed to leave the house because I have a lot of schoolwork to catch up on, so I have to rely on social media for interactions. People don't really make an effort to reach out to me specifically, aside from my boyfriend. They address the group chats and I'm included in the conversations but it's not a 1-on-1 deal.

I feel like such a burden and it's affecting me. I'm anxious all the time, at a low level, but I get spikes now and then. I really want to talk to people.  I messaged someone and told him to talk to me or I'd bite him, as a joke. His immediate response was ""im cleaning fuck off"". I'm lonely because I actually want to be social but trying to initiate it constantly is driving my self-worth into the ground. One of my close friends only really talks to me when she's doing badly. I don't mind helping her, I love her, but I wish we could talk normally. I wish I didn't have to post on my private stories, maybe twice a day, ""Someone go on a walk with me"" or ""Someone talk to me"". I don't get replies. 

I want to message people first. I want to take charge and start conversations. But I feel like people are beginning to talk about me behind my back because of how obviously desperate I am. I feel like I've crossed the boundary between ""endearingly social"" to ""overbearing and exhausting"" and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend is hosting a get-together for his friends tomorrow and I'm supposed to go but I want to stay home instead because I'm scared I'll just annoy everyone present. I'm scared I'm annoying him as well and I've thought about breaking up with him purely to save him the trouble of dealing with me. I have a lot of problems to work through and he lets me talk about them to him but I know he gets upset hearing about them and that's another reason why. I feel like if I were single then I wouldn't have any attachments with anyone and I could just delete Snapchat. It's my main way to communicate. If I don't have it on my phone, I can't message people and annoy them.

In Conclusion: I'm lonely because I feel like I annoy everyone

So yeah :) sorry for the long post. My psychologists over the years have said that I have symptoms of SA so maybe this is related to that",1,"the narrative indicates feelings of loneliness due to a perceived lack of meaningful social connections. despite having a boyfriend and a friend group, the person feels isolated because interactions are not personal or direct. they express anxiety and self-doubt, feeling like a burden and fearing they are annoying others. these feelings contribute to their sense of loneliness and desire for deeper, more personal connections that they currently lack."

This is after he got what he wanted (sexually- obvs on line due to Covid). And after that, and family being awful to me- including my dad finding it funny what the guy did to me- I just feel lonely as hell, depressed, and I just don??t see the point of carrying on.",1,the person is experiencing significant loneliness due to multiple factors including a lack of supportive relationships and recent emotional trauma. they mention feeling isolated after a disappointing interaction with someone they considered a source of comfort and also describe a lack of empathy and support from their family. this combination of social rejection and familial neglect contributes to their profound sense of loneliness.
"Feeling lonely, unhappy and dependent on other peopleI??m not exactly sure why, but often when I??m alone I feel so dead inside. I wish I had a girlfriend again so I didn??t have to sleep alone. When I??m in bed trying to sleep I just have to put on a YouTube video or a twitch stream, otherwise I feel so lonely and I keep myself awake, for hours sometimes, with my own thoughts. I keep telling myself that I need to learn to be happy on my own, but I keep feeling unhappy when I??m alone idk why.",1,the person is experiencing loneliness because they express feelings of unhappiness and dependency on others for emotional support they mention feeling dead inside when alone and needing distractions to avoid feelings of loneliness their desire for a girlfriend to avoid sleeping alone further highlights their loneliness
"I??m an unlikeable person, I??m lonely and it??s getting to me I think this is going to be like reading my diary. I thought if I got it all down on paper (keyboard and screen?), maybe I??d feel better. 

First thing I should say is I??m probably in a better place in life than a lot of the people here. I feel like a fraud for feeling bad about myself. I??m sorry for that and apologise in advance for anyone who feels annoyed or upset by my post. Then again, I am unlikeable so that won??t be a surprise. 

I??m married but my wife is often stressed about her job. Often she??s not really listening when I talk to her. It??s not a great feeling when the person who must love you the most in life isn??t that interested. I guess add boring to my list of character traits. When she is communicating with me we do get on really well.

My job often has me on my own for hours. I??ve not seen another person for five hours and I expect to go another three hours without seeing anyone today. I send messages to people I know in real life, people I know from Twitter, people on Reddit, but it??s always me doing the work. I??m always the last person to send a message and they??ll only contact me if they want something.  I was sitting around last night ?? my wife had gone to bed at nine ?? looking at my phone and thinking why am I so unlikeable? I??ve tried all sorts of things, being friendly, being funny, being attentive, being mysterious and being open. Basically being myself or not being myself, but whatever I am, people don??t like it. The number of new friends I??ve had for a few days is adding up and none of them stick around.

When I was young (under 11), being friendly, fairly clever and generally nice were good traits. I was never really popular but I had lots of friends at school and regularly played with them after. When it got to the teen years where being the clever kid meant all the cool kids would pick on me daily, I sort of retracted and didn??t go out. I think from the age of about 11-15, I only did something with people my own age about 5 times. After 16 things improved and I had friends, although none of them are still around. They all moved on when I was no longer useful to them to help with coursework or drive them around to the friends they really wanted to be with. Now as an adult I??ve basically got back into the situation where nobody really wants to talk to me. 

Unfortunately I haven??t come to some great conclusion or revelation in writing this. I guess I??ll leave this here for a bit and then delete it. Whatever.",1,"the person feels isolated and disconnected from others despite their efforts to engage socially. they express feelings of being unlikeable and not valued by those around them, including their spouse who is often preoccupied with work. they recount a history of struggling with social relationships from childhood through adulthood, which contributes to their sense of loneliness. their narrative reflects a deep sense of longing for meaningful connections that they find difficult to establish or maintain."

"Lonely in a relationship

I am so madly in love with my boyfriend and I know he loves me too. But his love for me does not align with the amount of love and care that I have for him. I love him so much and I love everything he does for me. However I crave something deeper than this generic love he has to offer me. Maybe it??s just my insecurities but I feel so very lonely. I seek his comfort sometimes by expressing my insecurities(about myself-not the relationship) but he ignores me... he doesn??t want to hear it, he doesn??t ask me any follow up questions. I feel like whenever I??m sad and seek comfort from him, he ignores it and talks about something else. And for that reason I feel lonely. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. My boyfriend is only present in my happiness and absent in my sorrow. I love him and I??m always searching for something deeper within him but it just isn??t there. I seek the deeper things in life and he seeks only the surface of what life has to offer(money and such). We are so different, and we have such different values, and I??m waiting for something that won??t happen. Yes I have talked about this with him, but I feel like he doesn??t care. I always try to communicate with him, but It doesn??t work out. So here I am. I feel so lonely and I always have even when surrounded by people who love me. What??s wrong with me? I know I should break up with him but I??m so attached and I??ve also lost my virginity to him so it??s even harder. God I feel so ungrateful but I need a deeper connection, a deeper mind, a deeper soul, a deeper love; something he has failed to offer. Am I bad girlfriend for thinking this way? Am I a bad person?",1,"the person feels lonely because they crave a deeper emotional connection and support from their boyfriend, which they are not receiving. despite being in a relationship and surrounded by people who love them, they feel misunderstood and emotionally neglected, leading to feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction."

This week we talked on the way to the library and had great conversations about different things again and met 2 of her friends on the way out and all talked for like an hour. For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was part of a friend group, no insecurities, just 4 people talking and having a good time. Or maybe I feel like that because I??m so deprived of human interaction.

But the other 6 days in a week I feel terrible. Just the usual hi??s and smiles to everyone and once the day ends, everyone has something to do while I go back home alone and wait for the next day I get human contact (I live relatively far away from campus while everyone else is closer). I don??t even like being alone anymore, It just makes me feel bad about myself.",1,"the person is lonely because they express feelings of emptiness and highlight the lack of regular human interaction in their life. they mention feeling terrible most days and feeling deprived of human contact, indicating a sense of isolation. their brief interactions with a new friend group are contrasted with the rest of the week where they feel alone and disconnected."
"Socially Isolated Once AgainReligion has always played a supreme role in my life. My entire family is deeply religious and made sure to surround me with religious enthusiasts my entire life. I went to a poor religious private school, where we were taught pseudoscience and harmful social behaviors. The kids there were pretentious as all hell (b/c they would afford a private school?) and the teachers enabled them to be assholes. Growing in settings like this, I was indoctrinated and forced to conform. These children became all I knew, and I maintained the same general friend group since Kindergarten. This has left me extremely underdeveloped socially.

&amp;#x200B;

Having awoken, realizing religion is not real, I publicly left the church as a young adult (18). I have since been shunned from my family and childhood friends. No one checks up on me, or understands me. I feel distant, and unwanted. This loneliness has been plaguing me for months now. I'm tired of living without any meaningful social interactions. How do I learn to cope with my new reality? I may be alone for a few years now.",1,"the person is lonely because they have been socially isolated after leaving their religious community. they were shunned by their family and childhood friends, leading to a lack of meaningful social interactions. they express feelings of distance, being unwanted, and a persistent sense of loneliness."
"I hate times like this where I'm just sitting here, thinking of my lifeI'm a loser etc. nothing new there. My loneliness is what's really hitting hard right now and I've never had a real friend. Even as a child. I was just tolerated and teachers forced people to be ""friends"" with me (someone told me when we were teenagers in the same school). Even the teachers seemed to bully me. Now I'm bordering 20 years old with no job or friends or life ahead of me and I'm still complaining about my childhood and how bad school was even though it's been two years now.",1,"the person is experiencing significant feelings of loneliness as they explicitly mention never having had a real friend, feeling tolerated rather than liked, and even experiencing bullying from teachers. they also express a lack of meaningful connections and prospects in their current life, which further underscores their isolation and loneliness"
"I never fit in anywhereLooking back at my past friendships, i realise that no one ever liked me. I used to be the kid at the back of the class who the teachers ask 'why dont you play with your friends?' So I changed myself to fit in but those friendships never lasted. 

Now, I have no meaningful relationships.

I dont know whats wrong with me, im a kid in a middle class family and 2 parents. No abuse, nothing traumatic happened to me. So why am i so alone?",1,the person feels lonely because they express a consistent pattern of social isolation and lack of meaningful relationships despite efforts to change themselves. they also reflect on their past with a sense of rejection and confusion about their inability to connect with others.

I don't feel comfortable sharing too many personal details because it's so fresh to me but I'm really struggling. I have three young kids. I'm struggling emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. My unemployment is taking forever to go through since I had go quit my job to move and I have very little money left to get what my kids and I need. I'm exhausted 24/7 because my kids have been struggling to sleep since we moved. I feel like a terrible mother. I have not made any new friends yet and my family is far away. I'm lonely and feeling hopeless right now and would love some emotional support and kind words please.",1,"the person is lonely because they recently left an abusive relationship and moved to a new area where they have not made any new friends. they also mention feeling isolated with their family being far away and struggling to cope with multiple stressors, which contributes to their loneliness."
"The depression that strikes when eased lockdown restrictions make no difference to your lifeRestrictions in England eased recently so people can meet in gardens and terraces and outdoor places e.g. outside pubs and restaurants etc 

It??s very depressing when the eased lockdown restrictions make no difference to your life and everyone else is seeing all the people they have been longing to see for months whereas for me, my life is still the same, I am still miserable and alone with no social life and mental and physical health issues. Wahoo, isn??t life fun!

I was outside earlier as I had to post a parcel and when I was walking back home everywhere was just full of people sat outside catching up with people whereas for me I was just alone and I stay in my miserable lonely existence.

"my traumas shaped me into the person I am today and I can't bear living as myself anymoreTW: sxual assault

I was never educated on consent, sex and romance when I was little so I had to explore it all by myself, which led to a year or two of constant assault and slut-shaming from my classmates. At the time I didnt know it was bad and I would just play along in effort to fit in as ""one of the boys"" because I found it quite difficult to befriend girls (I was bullied by a girl deskmate for most of my elementary school years). The boys would call me sl*t, wh*re, anything degrading they could think of, the girls would see me getting assaulted in the middle of the class and ignore, my 7th grade was the start of my ever-declining mental health. I hated myself, I thought I was cheap, easy, undesirable and most of all filthy. I kept dating boys after boys to seek the validation and emotional warmth my parents didnt give me. They didnt know what I was going through and they weren't the type to shower their children with loving warmth. 

I end up a messed up person and ruined my chances with genuinely good people, while at the same time get into toxic relationships and endure even more harassment from my partner's friends. They lovebombed me so they could get in my pants, they pretended to be my friend to emotionally torment me for their sick twisted pleasure and I let them step on me just so I wouldn't feel lonely. My only best friend ever of 3 years dated me and I was genuinly happy for a short while, recently he dropped me for another girl and said he no longer wanted anything to do with me. I have absolutely no one to talk to anymore. I can't talk to my parents about anything, my sibling simply doesn't care, no one's interested in getting to know me.

 I like art, I like film, I like anime, I like music, I like fashion, I like playing games too. I listen and watch everything from mainstream to obscure &amp; I just wish someone would give me a chance to talk about it. I picked up so many hobbies in desperate attemps to connect to people but no one would want to befriend me.

It's been 6 years and I still can't recover from what happened those schoolyears. I have no self-esteem, I'm clinically depressed, anxious and on the verge of developing an ED from starving myself locking myself in my room. I feel unworthy of love because no one would want this used up, worn out mess that's been through everybody else's hands. I still get nightmares about my past relationships and SA often and everytime I would wake up crying until I can't see anymore. I'm full of shame, guilt, anxiety and trauma. All I want is to have a genuine friend but everyone wants to use me for something and I can't help but believe I'm worthless. I'm in mental anguish every minute I'm still alive. I don't want to exist in this disgusting flesh anymore. I've always contemplated suicide ever since the incidents and I don't know how much longer I can resist the urge to just end it all",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of isolation and desperation for genuine human connection. the individual describes a history of traumatic experiences, lack of supportive relationships, and repeated attempts to find companionship that have ended in further emotional harm. they express a deep sense of worthlessness and a longing for someone to genuinely care about them. the extensive list of hobbies and interests mentioned seems to be an effort to connect with others, which has been unsuccessful. this combination of factors underscores their profound loneliness."
"The World Is Taunting MeIt hurts so much seeing everybody tell a awesome stories about adventures they want on with friends and the like. People talking about getting invited to bowling and sleepovers or any other activities involving friends. But I??ve never had that. I??ve never been close with anyone irl. Nobody has ever cared about me, nobody has ever enjoyed me enough to invite me somewhere. I feel like this world is torturing me by showing me what I can??t have. It especially sucks because I??m actually really sociable but people at my school are incredibly bigoted and mean and overall just horrible people. I don??t think there??s been a day where somebody hasn??t been called a f*ggot or a n*gger here. It??s even worse because they make up like 99% of the place. So there??s really nobody to talk to. And like I said, it??s tenfold painful seeing my online acquaintances talk about how they??re gonna hang out with friends and the like, because then I like at myself and I realize that I have nothing and nobody.  Not to mention I don??t want to grow up with nothing meaningful to look back on. I want to be able to have stories to tell about my friends, I want moments I can look back at and laugh about with them, I just want this part of life to mean something when I look back on it. But no, nothing good ever happens to me. I wish this world could just kill me off. I feel like a dying prisoner being kept alive only so he can be tortured. I feel like a dying horse getting beat with a bat. I just wish there was someone. Someone to numb the pain that I have to go through everyday just for being alive.",1,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of isolation and longing for social connection. the person describes not having close relationships in real life and feeling excluded from social activities. they also mention the pain of seeing others talk about their friendships and experiences, which highlights their sense of loneliness. additionally, the negative environment at their school exacerbates their feelings of isolation, as they describe it as a place where bigotry is prevalent and there is nobody to talk to. overall, the narrative strongly indicates that the person feels lonely."
"Hometown BluesThis whole pandemic has made me realize how little my friends back home contact me. I??ve been back for a couple months now after being gone for work for about 5 months. You??d think that I??d see an increase in texting, calling, or video chatting from my friends, but I??ve gotten almost nothing since being here. I know everyone has their own lives, but I??m always the one to initiate contact and keep holding the conversations with my friends. I??m going to college here in a couple weeks, and I hope I??ll be able to find some friends to talk to while going to school. I want one of those groups that goes to bars together (when things open back up), ones that invite me to do things as I do them. I??ve never had that, and I??d love to experience not always asking first.",1,the person feels lonely because they realize their friends from home do not reach out to them despite their efforts to maintain contact. they hope to find new friends in college who will include them in activities without always needing them to initiate. this desire for reciprocal friendship and feeling neglected by current friends indicates loneliness.
"I want to go back to before I knew what friends were likeIt's addicting. I had no friends before and it sucked but it's not like I knew any different. Now I know and I hate it. I found a nice Discord server and started to really enjoy myself there before I was banned without warning or reason, never breaking a rule. It's genuinely stupid how much it hurts. Nobody there has any interest in my friendship outside of that server. I can't stand going back to the loneliness, can't risk being hurt again.",1,"the person is lonely because they express a deep sense of isolation and pain from losing their only social connection on a discord server. they mention having no friends before and struggling with loneliness, and now that they've experienced friendship, the loss feels even more painful. their narrative reflects a strong desire for companionship and fear of returning to their previous state of loneliness."

It felt good to get it out, even if people haven't read this yet, well, I want to be better but I just don't know how, each day overwhelms me, I can't go to sleep knowing there is a day after, but it's harder to think that there won't be, I know I'm just 14 but I feel things too, and I hope no one feels like this too. This whole thing started some time ago, I had been doing something that took a toll on me, so much so that I got so stressed that I got sick out of it, and felt like the worst ever, my parents supported me each day of it, and I would be happy knowing that when I get back home I see them, it still hurt and was horrible but better, now it feels like everything I do, I think about how it was then, how hard it's been and how painful it was, I can't let my parents keep helping me, I know they want to but, it's hard for them too, to help and give and listen, and I can't be with my parents and brother because each one of them is never home.

"20th Birthdayi'm sure there are just as many posts like this as there are users, but in under an hour, it will be the end of my 20th birthday. 
as expected, i spent it alone. i don't have any close friends, so i'm not surprised i wasn't wished happy birthday or anything like that, that wasn't a problem. the problem was just the entire day being a reminder of how alone i am.

the last 3 years of birthdays i've had haven't been ideal, and only get worse each year. it's just a really difficult time for me when everyone seems to always have atleast someone there to talk to meanwhile you're sat inside unable to do anything with anyone on your ""special day"" except vent about it to anonymous people on the internet.

less of a complaint and more of a way of getting stuff off my chest i suppose. 
i understand if this gets removed for any reason since this is just a jumble of whines put together in a sentence, but that's all.

thanks for reading x",1,"the narrative clearly shows signs of loneliness as the person describes spending their 20th birthday alone with no close friends or anyone to wish them a happy birthday. they express feelings of isolation and a pattern of increasingly worse birthdays over the past few years. the narrative reflects a sense of being alone on a day that is supposed to be special, further emphasizing their loneliness."
"Feeling guilty for wanting a high quality friendNot sure how many people out there are going through this. I guess it makes me a bit of a choosing beggar, but I really don't want to be friends with just *anyone*. 

I want to meet people who not only share a few surface level interests, but who I have true chemistry with. Who share my worldview, ideals, and perhaps even share a few important goals. Someone you can grow with and talk to on a deeper level. There's a time and place for small talk, but it's just not very nourishing on an emotional or spiritual level. 

After being alone/friendless for a certain amount of time, you just have a craving to speak to someone about something other than ""what's trending"", or swapping a basic list of ""things you do in your free time"".

"I feel empty when Im not playing games.I have one true friend that I have the honor of being friends with. But other than that, every time of get off I just feel empty. I dont talk to much of my family. Dont have a girlfriend. I have a handful of friends that i can talk to on games but not irl. Its sooo fucked. Be a sociable creature who cant socialize is the worst. I have tried to find someone that i could wake up and talk to every morning. Chat during the day and evening. Say our goodnights. But i never can. The only thing i have to look forward to is for that one good buddy of mine to get on for a few hours after school",1,"the person feels a deep sense of emptiness and isolation outside of their gaming activities. they mention having only one true friend and a lack of meaningful connections in real life. their desire for a close, daily companion goes unfulfilled, contributing to their loneliness. they also express difficulty in socializing despite wanting to be sociable, further highlighting their sense of isolation."

"People that cheat on their partners don't deserve any type of love.Let me just start by saying that I have never been cheated on, so please don't recommend subs like r/survivinginfidelity. 

I guess I'm what you would call a ""forever alone"" type person. I'm not close with my family and I have no friends or romantic interests. When I see couples walking down the street holding hands it bums me out a little. I would love to have someone to fall asleep with and wake up to in the morning. Someone that I can cuddle up on the couch with and go on fun dates and have amazing sex. I really want intimacy but I know it's very likely I will never get it, so it really pisses me off when I see someone that's been cheated on. It takes a special kind of scum bag to betray a person's trust and break their heart to the point that they're not even the same person anymore. People get cheated on and they are so traumatised by it that they never trust anyone ever again, and they may also need to seek therapy. They get their heart broken in the worst way possible and they end up turning to drugs and alcohol to help them cope, and they may even turn to self harm and maybe even suicide.

Even if they recover from being betrayed, it's very possible that they still have self image issues and have low confidence/self esteem and they find it very hard to trust others and be intimate with them and commit to them. 

If you've cheated on someone then you're a piece of shit and you don't deserve love. They're are countless people out there that want nothing more than to fall in love and be happy, and here you are ripping out a person's heart and shitting all over it. In all seriousness, how do you sleep at night knowing that you're a piece of shit?

If anyone reading this has been cheated on, I'm so sorry you had to go through all that emotional stress and turmoil. I hope you recover and can find confidence within yourself and not let being cheated on define your worth as a person or a lover and I hope you find someone that will never betray you.

Thanks for reading.",1,the person expresses feelings of loneliness and isolation they mention not being close with family and having no friends or romantic interests their desire for intimacy and companionship is evident and they express sadness when seeing couples together their pessimism about ever finding intimacy further highlights their sense of loneliness
"Terrified of being lonely foreverI'm only 16 and I feel like loneliness will be here forever. I just can't conceptualize or believe that someday it'll be gone and I'll have friends. It's never seemed possible, and if I hope for it I'll inevitably be disappointed. I don't have good friends, I won't ever go to prom with anyone, I won't have fun in the last few enjoyable years of life before adulthood. All the adults I've met say it's depressing and horrible, that they're broke and work day after day just to make ends meet. And I can't even enjoy the parts that make life fun.

I wonder what's wrong with me that makes me unlovable. Why do I never get included? What do I keep doing wrong that incites these patterns of exclusion? People tell me I am very authentic, that I am always myself and never fake. So I need to accept I guess that my real self is meant to be lonely.",1,"the narrative clearly indicates feelings of loneliness and isolation. the individual expresses a deep fear of being lonely forever, lacks good friends, and feels excluded. they wonder what is wrong with them and why they are unlovable, suggesting a profound sense of loneliness and self-doubt. the narrative aligns with the label as the person is experiencing significant loneliness."
"The loneliness eats away at me, relentless in it's hunger.I'm an average 21 year old college going male, and I have friends, dear and close to me who I actively spend time with. I have family, who I may not always like, but who I do love, and who I'm fairly certain love me back. I have a social support group, and people with whom I spend time and do things with, and yet it just... there's something missing.

There's this desire inside me for a romantic relationship with a woman. The desire and need for that is so intense it sometimes dwarfs the gratitude I feel for the other relationships in my life. 
I don't know why but that's the only type of relationship missing from my life and I'll spend nights awake, curling into myself because that specific loneliness, the kind that comes from not having anyone to hold and kiss and make love to, the kind that comes from making breakfast for only one and finding a pretty flower and having no one to give it to, it just... fuck it hurts. It hurts and hurts and hurts and it's a physical fucking pain right in my gut, kind of to the left and above my belly button. I see people holding hands and loving each other and I'm so happy for them, but it also fills me with this... jealousy. And anger. And I just. I want that. I want to find someone who I can grow with and be with. 

And I'm not looking for my other half anymore. I understand that I, as a person, am and should be enough for my own life. I want someone who adds to and enchances my life. Because sometimes I'll make a souffl?? and it turns to ash in my mouth upon seeing that there's only one plate at my table. I'll be sleeping with five blankets on and a foot sticking out and the heat on and the fan at max and the windows open and yet the cold doesn't come from the outside, from a stray wind or a cool breeze. The cold comes from this place inside of me, seeping away all of my heat until all the blankets and all the heating in the world don't matter. The only thing that can warm my cold and rotting core is a pair of warm hands, and I just... don't have that.

And it's not a lack of physical intimacy that's causing it. I need emotional intimacy coupled with it. I'm sure I could go out downtown and find someone to have sex with it. But I don't want someone to just have sex with. Sex is meaningless. It's all sprawled limbs and heavy breathing and tongue and mouth and... ick. It's just. Without love and emotion, sex is just the mechanical action of human coupling. Our current society is so obsessed with looks, or money, or what you have and what you own, that people completely fail to see what's inside. It's like, your value is only determined by how good you look or how much money you have. I want someone to love me for ME. My soul. For who I am as a person, not what I have or what I can provide. I want the unconditional, unyielding love that I've only seen between parents and their kids, or read about in romance novels. I want someone who doesn't see my physical skin and bones, but rather what it houses, and the person inside and chooses to love that person, romantically. I've had this love from friends, but not romantically, you know? This pure love from my parents, and other loved ones, but I need it romantically. 

It's just all so complicated. These human emotions with human consequences. I wish life wasn't so goddamn complicated. I wish we didn't get hurt by people who claimed they loved us but were only after the things we provided. I wish the people we were meant to be with would find us and that they'd love us back when we found them. Most of all, I wish this loneliness would stop eating bits and pieces of me, or better yet, I wish I didn't need that romantic love, and that my restless heart could be satiated with the non romantic love that I already have in my life.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of longing and emotional pain stemming from the absence of a romantic relationship. despite having friends and family who care, the person feels an intense, specific type of loneliness that cannot be alleviated by their current social connections. the detailed descriptions of physical and emotional discomfort highlight the depth of their loneliness and desire for a romantic partner."

"How do I get used to loneliness?This year was miserable for me. I??ve dealt with loneliness like never before, and I happen to be a very energetic person. Sometimes I have so many ideas on where to go, what to do and what to let consume my energy. I have a boyfriend, but recently he has made me feel even more alone because of his lack of engagement in things. He sleeps till midday and disregards plans we made the night before. I spend the rest of my day waiting for him to wake up and get going... it never happens. My other childhood friend is busy with family. She has her cousin??s and sibling??s company all the time, so she??s never available. My phone is dead most of the time and no one is interested to ever invite me out. That one other friend who parted ways a long time ago disappears after we hang out and never calls again. I find myself to be a nice, non-judgmental person who initiates conversations about everything. I don??t think I have made anyone feel bad before and I am not annoying. I just have had a hard time making friends because I am a social outcast and a very introverted person. All it takes for someone to get close to me is the first approach and then I am the one who takes other steps.

Aside from all of that, I just want to look forward to getting used to loneliness now. To getting used to isolation and quit looking at how others are socializing and going places because that will never be me. I don??t want the next upcoming years to be as miserable as this one was due to crying every night because of the loneliness And worthlessness I feel. All this time I??ve been hoping that maybe I could reconcile with my old friends but it wasn??t possible due to unreturned interest. I have no one to rely on anymore, I miss how my boyfriend used to be and I miss my self. I have lost sense of who I am. I was a happy person, I still try to be whenever I can, I try dress up for my liking, I try to have fun but I have realized that the clothes I buy ..I have nowhere to wear, the fun I want to have is impossible to achieve with no one around me, and the laughter I aspire is nowhere near.",1,"the person is experiencing significant loneliness due to several factors including a lack of engagement from their boyfriend, the unavailability of their childhood friend, and the absence of other social connections. they feel isolated and have a hard time making new friends due to being introverted and feeling like a social outcast. their efforts to reconnect with old friends have been unsuccessful, leading to feelings of worthlessness and misery. they express a desire to get used to loneliness as they feel it will be a constant in their life."

"Damn it quarantineSeeing all my neighbors just play outside, barbecue constantly and riding their bikes . Just reminds of how lonely I am. My original goal for quarantine was just to study while being in lockdown. However,  I didn't count on hearing so many people laugh and tell countless stories outside my window. So instead of working I'm just sitting here wishing I could have someone to have genuine laugh with.  Sometimes I just watch my neighbors then proceed to cry from all the love and affection being displayed(I know it sounds creepy sorry) . Also, I feel pretty pathetic for saying this but I would give anything just to receive a warm hug from someone. I want some type of connection or something like it. I'm usually able to play off these emotions move along to my class or job.  However,  being in lockdown has forced me to deal with my loneliness head on. It's eating at me like a fucking parasite barrowing in my skin at night. I'm getting so desperate for contact with anyone that I will go out searching for it wherever I can find it. I don't ever want to go to that dark place again considering how things usually end with me spending money nonstop or having sex with random dudes. I have such low self-esteem I would believe everything a random guy tells me.A guy could tell me if was raining  monkeys outside and I wouldn't even bat an eye at him.

Over lockdown, all my ??friends?? had book clubs, murder mystery nights, D&amp;D nights... I wasn??t invited to one, and the book club I tried to set up with them failed when nobody would read the book. 
My parents have always disliked me - told me at 16 that there was just something fundamentally unloveable about me. 
I found out yesterday that the one person I thought really, unconditionally loved me, my sister, was talking about me behind my back. 
It??s reached the stage where I have literally nobody to talk to, to trust... There really must be something fundamentally wrong with me, but I don??t know what it is.

She's gone and I need to move on from that. I shouldn't dwell on the awful things she said and did to me. But I realize now what I miss might not be her, but someone to share life with. To laugh and cry, to hold and be held by. I don't know how I got by without her for my first 20 years, and I don't know how I'm going to get by without her. 

But I miss having someone to talk to about our shared interests, or teaching her more of mine, or learning more of hers. To believe that I can speak openly and freely about anything and not be thought less of for. I want someone to warm my bed again. To talk about our days when we both know what the day held wasn't interesting, but we talk anyways. Because we love each other. I miss being able to make someone's cheeks explode when I say something funny, and it make me feel both excited and nervous. I want again to have butterflies every time I kiss someone. To be looked at and feel the love in her eyes. Or to feel her laughing and slapping my back to ""Put me down!""

I don't know if I'm going to find ""her"" again. And while I'm stuck in my small college town for the next two years, I can't help but feel even more lonely. Because I doubt I'm going to find her here.

"As lonely as I've never been before.Im 25, male and am currently as lonely as I never was. About 6 Months ago things spiralled downwards and for a few weeks/months. Im on Rockbottom. Dad Got sick 4 years ago, died 3 years ago, relation to other family members went from meh to bad/nothing. Had a bunch of friends and roommates. Moved out in bad terms. Girlfriend of 2 years left me. I completely isolated myself like never before in my life.      

Breakup is different than when Dad died. Both is losing a person you love.      

When someone dies the problem is that you can try as hard as you want. You won't be able to speak with them or reach them anyhow. After a breakup the person is just gone but still existing in this world. But handling it is similar. One has to be thankful for the past while looking forward.

I had phases before where I wouldn't meet with friends for some time or where I neglected attendance to events. Skipped school to not meet anyone. But never this long, this intense. If I look back I see it like reoccurring behaviour of mine. I worked out ways and mechanisms in the past to counter it, I really try to apply them but its hard to change old and establish new habits. Some times it works better than other times.

I think too early after my Dad died I met my now ex-girlfriend. I could focus a lot on making her happy instead of focus on my own improvement. I forgot myself in the relationship and was happy about it because I didn't want to think about what the fuck I actually have to do now where Dad is gone and Im just 22/23.        

In February I went to some self-help group. That was weird. But I think it actually was better being there than another lonely evening of web browsing. One time there already gave me some ""tools"" I try to work with. I want to go again this month.      

Earlier this week I failed my driving exam. One of the few things I tried in a long time. Afterwards the examiner said that at first he thought I was joking but then was afraid of his life. lol. Why the fuck do I pay driving teacher money when he doesn't actually teach me to drive and sends me to test like that.     

I think start of my process of becoming a man again instead of being a lonely, stoned slug is to take responsibility.       

I fucked up the exam. I will go back to learning and try again soon. Focus on the future.       

But one of the big problems I have is that there is just so much time to fill and nobody to share with. Does happiness even exist when there is nobody to share it with? Next week new semester begins and a few weeks ago I started to run and swim a bit again. Both lonely activity but its improvement. Improving everyday a little. What do I want this week, in the next 10 weeks, where do I see myself in 6 months?      



I will stop here. Sorry for wall of text, anyone actually reads this far? :D

I get upset about it. But now it's just how it's always been. I don't get a message from anyone. No joke. No exaggeration. No one. I have friends and that but I always feel like background noise. I'm everyone's ""mate"" but No Ones Friend if u catch my drift. And no one seems to care. I spend my days drawing and nothing else. And when I get upset about my life the only people who can or will try cheer me up are my family. And I hate when they give me advice because it does nothing for me. And when my friends do occasionally try help. Everything seems false or flat. Like there trying to just shut me up. I've been trying to get a girlfriend for ages now. But no such luck. I'm like a normal looking guy. And I try to look my best but I guess I'm not much to right home about. Not to mention I have best trust issues.

Maybe if people start to get to now me they'll know I'm smart, I'm funny, and I'm nice. But no body gives me a chance.
No one to talk to. I'm too ugly to have a date. It's very lonely. I surely don't care. 
Nobody knows the real me. Nobody even bothers to ask me 'how I'm doing or if I want to go the the movies' because no body cares about me. I'm too shy and ugly.

I met with a gal who came out to meet me, because I have really bad anxiety with driving. She came out from about 30 minutes away, and we hungout at one of her favorite spots at the beach, and we just talked for a long while. She literally made my heart feel again, just her smile made me feel so good, and I felt again. She is so sweet, and told me she'd love to meet up again.

She had just messaged me not too long ago and told me that I was truly a amazing guy, but that she had met someone else she gets along with, and hoped to stay friends.

I??m just destined to live a lonely life... I hope not :P I hope I can make friends in highschool. I want to know how to make friends in highschool. I hate being alone and I hate anxiety.

I'm still seeing a therapist, and I'm on Prozac.Nothing has worked.While it's not crippling, I would describe loneliness as my biggest plight before anything else. Like, I'd rather be a quarter million in debt than continue being so lonely.People are flabbergasted when I tell them that I still have no friends or significant other despite all that I've done.

"Does anyone else make up stories in their head and can't stop?Hey y'all,
I just discovered this sub and after crying for 30mins straight after realizing how much I relate to all of you I started thinking about my loneliness and the first time I really noticed it. 
I told someone when I was about 7 years old, that I made up stories and worlds in my mind and played them out in my head before falling asleep, kind of like a goodnight story for myself. The other person just looked at me weird and laughed at me. She told others and they all made fun of me.


The thing is, I still do this. I still make up a story for myself while trying to fall asleep. Mostly the stories will be inspired by movies/series/books etc. 
I like to imagine myself being the well liked lead role or my own character who's liked by everyone in that imaginary scene. It makes me feel powerful and not so lonely anymore. 
Due to corona my school is closed so I have a lot of time and lately I've noticed that I will take about 3-4 naps a day and set 5 alarms for after my ""big"" sleep so I can fall asleep multiple times. That way I can make up more stories instead of facing the hard truth that I'm lonely as fuck.
So I guess my question is wether anyone else imagines scenes in their head as well and if anyone has tips for kind of getting control over it again?


tl;dr:
I make up stories before I go to sleep where I'm well liked and it's gotten to a point where I'll sleep multiple times a day just to imagine a scene in my head. 
Does anyone else do this?
Does anyone know how I can stop this from deteriorating further?",1,the person is experiencing significant loneliness as evidenced by their reliance on imaginary stories for comfort and the emotional reaction upon discovering others with similar experiences they explicitly mention feeling lonely and use these stories as a coping mechanism to escape their reality they also express a desire to control this behavior which indicates awareness of its impact on their life

So I really, really feel lonely, I feel like i have no one to be me, like i don't really belong with people or social environment's.
And the more I feel like that, the more I'm starting to hate everyone else, like real hate. I can't stand anyone because I don't think as them as equals, they're inferior to me. But the real thing is that I feel really lonely and it's my only way to get over it.

I've been trying for years to improve my social skills but it's just not working. I haven't had a hug from someone that isn't family in years. I have no motivation to go to school because nobody talks to me. I feel like I'm virtually invisible to everyone.

"""I am lonely""- A femaleMy favorite thing is when I'll meet a guy and try to be friends, then he'll talk about how being lonely sucks and I'll agree, but that agreement sits wrong with him because I'm a girl and girls don't lack friends, right? (And now we see why he's lonely, too.) 

Alright, you caught me, I lied. Truth be told, I have friends. I also have trust issues because of things bizarre situations with extensive lies that don't even matter but they were enough to make me wonder what is and isn't true. That's just impermanence, baby. 

Speaking of impermanence, is it still a lie if it was true in the moment? Is it still a lie if it's not true to the moment, but true to the needs your mind puts above honesty? 

When I had trouble sleeping, I'd take medication every night, and I'd lay there and think til I slept. I could always tell they were working because I couldn't touch my thoughts. They were there, but too far away to keep. I'd chase them until I slept. Now, I take a different medication to kill the imagining when my eyes are closed. I am not sure if my life is better without nightmares.

Back to my original point, I am lonely. 
I'm torn between making the friendships I have into what I want (people aren't disposable) or starting over. I was someone dark on the inside, who openly shows it, but they long for good. Long for good with me? I don't think my friends have the emotional capacity for what I'm describing. There's a certain door in the hall of personality that can only be unlocked with trauma and understanding. Understanding is the real key there.
I don't love them any less (believe me, I've got much love to give and I try to give it to everyone I've met), but I don't believe we can be friends on a deeper level. You can't blame them for what they haven't experienced. I'm trying to grow. I did so well with it lately and it only has been through God-given hard work. 

I long for someone to long for good and growth with, someone I can tell my random memories to without them being mildly disturbed and confused (especially when they're not even bad), someone who understands humans the same as I do, someone who will laugh at dark things that aren't jokes at all with me, while understanding the different between blatant arrogance and a joke, someone who will make me less lonely, but only at my core.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of loneliness despite having friends. the individual struggles with trust issues and feels disconnected on a deeper emotional level. they desire meaningful connections and understanding, which they feel their current friends cannot provide. this yearning for a deeper bond and the feeling of being misunderstood contributes to their loneliness."

"I just miss my friendsI had many friends, I was happy and didn't really feel lonely or sad since I had such a big support group. We all did things together, hangout every single day and had fun being stupid together, it literally was the perfect setup. 
Fast forward a couple years and we go into 2016, it was a great year for me since I had an amazing job that paid insanely well. 
Things changed though, I noticed people quit hitting me up, they were getting offended over my jokes I posted on Facebook and I noticed my friends list was shrinking.
I downloaded an app called ""Who Unfriended Me?"" which tells you in real-time the moment someone unfriended you on Facebook, with their full name so you know who it was exactly.
Once I installed that app I got dozens of notifications daily from it saying ""&lt;insert name&gt; has unfriended/ blocked you"". And it was all from the people I thought were my best friends, over the course of about a week or so I had already lost 80+ friends and counting.
The last straw was on my birthday NOBODY wished me a happy birthday, dead silence for the entire day. 
That was what made me decide to deactivate my account and just forget about everyone. I just think back on all the fun I had and I just miss all my friends, its been lonely living life without friends and I wish them all the best.

"I might just end up a hermit, what's the point of living surrounded by people when I have never felt loved my in my life?Im about as normal person as one can be, except I don't think living in society is doing it anymore. 

In my 24 years of life by far the thing I've felt the most is rejection, rejection from my family, my friends, my ""love interests"", my peers, etc.  I've struggled with low self esteem for a long part of my life because I've never received validation from the outside, I've had to learn to validate and love my self because literally no one else will, normally I'd think that's a sign that I'm a shitty person and I need to change myself but I don't think that's it anymore, for years I've been working on improving myself, I've tried to be a better person, more empathic, more loving, more outgoing and more understanding but the result is still the same: I'm still lonely ALL. THE. TIME. 

What's the point of being surrounded by people if it ultimately makes me feel worse? The only person with whose support and love I can always count on is myself so why am I even bothering trying to connect to people? 

So I have a plan, this summer I'll finish college and im going away on a backpacking trip all by myself and I'll live off the land for at least a couple of months until I decide wether I'll go back or I'll keep going. I wont say where I live or where I'm going but simply put, im going south. I'll go as far south as I can. I might come back to my hometown or not, I'll make up my mind during the trip. 

I want to, for at least one time in my life, live completely independently from everyone else and be truly free, if I'm to be alone, I rather be alone doing what I love outside of the endless contradictions of living in the civilized world.

Never had someone want to be with me romantically) but boy could I have not chosen a worse time! The way I look and my shitty social skills were hurdles I could work on but quarantine is something out of my control.

"Trying to kick addiction, but the lonelyness is pushing me back.I (m24) have been an every day cannabis smoker for 11 years now, to be honest those 11 years have been pretty happy, I have very supportive friends and family and I feel so grateful for that. The current pandemic has led me to no longer have the funds to cover my habit, so I have decided to cut weed and tobacco out of my life. This is no doubt the hardest thing I have ever tried to do, but I can see the positives of leaving it. My real problem is that I feel totally disconnected from everyone around me, I have always felt this way but when I'm stoned I can easily overlook these feelings and they don't affect me. When I'm sober I cannot overlook this, it affects me terribly everyday knowing that I have no one to vent to, no one to talk to, no one who really cares. My friends have decided to continue smoking, so I have had to distance myself if I'm to have any chance of success. I can talk to my mum about it but she always becomes very insistent that leaving the house will help, meeting new people and all that, I live in a tiny village in cornwall in the south west of england. Going out does not allow me to meet new people as I already know 90% of everyone who lives here. Plus I don't drink. So going to the pub is in no way an option for me. I really struggle to connect with people because of this, in my local area most people socialise at the pub, being someone who likes to stay as far away from alcohol as possible I do not go to the pub. Socialising is far far easier for me when I'm stoned, and that feeling is making me think, what's the point in quitting when life felt so much better when I was stoned. I genuinely feel that if I could find a group (or just 1) new friendship that doesn't revolve around smoking my mental health would improve tenfold. But obviously that is far more easily said than done. 

Thanks for reading, just needed to vent somewhere. Even if no one sees.",1,"the person feels disconnected from everyone around them and has no one to vent to or talk to. they feel that their friends who continue smoking are not supportive in their effort to quit, and their mother’s advice does not seem helpful given their living situation. their struggle to connect with people and the isolation from not going to the pub contributes to their loneliness."
"I??m a college junior and I have no college friendsSpecifically, I am an art school student. I have been here since my freshman year of college. 

I attend a college in a different state, so no one here is anyone I??ve known since Highschool nor did I come here with anyone I??ve known. When I was a freshman in college I had some really toxic roommates, who were really rude, made fun of me, yell at me about things, and only talk to me just to tell me what was wrong with my art during critiques. They also didn??t like me because I wasn??t like them, because I was ??nerdy??/??dorky?? and not stereotypically feminine, or didn??t smoke/vape, drink, have any dating or sexual experience. I??m convinced one of them was a complete narcissist and she really manipulated the other and would even bully her, but she was too insecure and even a bit stupid to see how terrible of a friend she was.

I had no friends at all then. I eventually had been moved out of that dorm because of how bad the abuse had gotten. I was then moved into another dorm that next semester. With a roommate and suitemates I had gotten along with pretty well. Then the corona pandemic hit and we all pretty much moved out of the dorm building that spring break. Unfortunately I never had any way of contacting them, no phone numbers, no social media, nothing. One of them actually had been following my Instagram for awhile, but she eventually unfollowed me because my content didn??t appeal to her (I??m an art blog and meme account on Instagram). We were never close or anything, but I guess it kinda made sense for her to unfollow me. Now being in the present, I do see them in the halls and such. I say hi and try to be friendly, but I worry they forgot about me. (That is the roommate and suitemate that didn??t unfollow me on Instagram)

My last school year was obviously all online, so I didn??t get to interact with anyone and I never did turn on my web cam all that much for people to recognize me. Except what would be the point anyway? I don??t have any friends and I doubt anyone would try to get to know me if they saw me in person. I had a roommate that school year who was generally pretty friendly and did try to get to know me, but she was always visiting her boyfriend every weekend, so we never got to form a proper friendship, yet she seemed to have ties to other classmates and good at making friends. That next semester she decided to stay home, because she thought it was silly we were living in dorms when not going to physical classes. I occasionally see her in the hallways, and she says hello in all. But we??re not in any classes or anything.

With now college being in person again, I am reminded just how lonely I am and how I barely have any friends. It??s like literally everyone in all my classes know someone in there and manage to have a conversation with everyone. Even the people who don??t talk for shit or even try. How? They even get invited to do stuff and make plans after class and for weekends and get invited to eachothers dorms. 

Occasionally we get put into groups, and luckily enough there??s sometimes someone in that group that wants to have a conversation. Except there??s been occasions where I get 3rd wheeled in those. Because 2 people in those groups really begin to hit it off. I would share my social medias, except unfortunately they??ve become a place for me to vent and I??m someone who doesn??t share my Instagram with people I barely know. Because I can??t explain the hellhole it??s become and I don??t want people to know of the petty asshole I usually come off as (venting that is).

It??s even a little infuriating too. The roommate I have this school year is very socially awkward and a little weird and barely ever talks to me. She claimed to have no college friends, but apparently she has conversations with classmates in classes, gets invited to do stuff, and sometimes invites people to our dorm. Like motherfucker, yes you do. 

I even fear my Highschool friends (my only friend group) are losing interest in me. I feel like they don??t care about my interests, new things I??ve discovered or watched and things I??m writing. I had recently gotten invited to hangout with friends over this Thanksgiving break and I felt a little 3rd wheeled a bit there. I don??t know or think I??ll be losing them as friends. But I don??t know what to do. 

I was pretty lonely in Highschool too, I literally went into Highschool alone and with no friends. It wasn??t until 2nd semester of sophomore year I actually started to have a friend group. 

It??s just why does everyone else to get to function normally and not me?

"(20 F) feeling super lonely and indifferent latelyI??ve always been shy, quiet and reserved so making friends was incredibly hard growing up. On top of that my father was in the military so we moved around a lot. Not having solid friends became the norm and now as an adult I find myself very empty, lonely and codependent. I got out of a three year relationship a few months ago and he was literally my other half. He understood me, he became my best friend, we did everything together. It??s been really hard to part ways, for me at least, and I find myself super confused and hurt about what relationships are and how they??re suppose to be. I went from having someone next to me for three whole years to having no one at all, and it hits me the most when I??m lying in bed and no ones there beside me. I??ve tried to get back into dating and or at least talking to people but it feels really really meaningless and I don??t connect with any of them like I connect with him. I also have the fear of getting into another relationship and again a few years down the line I??m in the same predicament. I??m in a really rough place and just want to know someone understands.",1,"the individual describes feeling very lonely and struggling with forming and maintaining relationships. they mention a history of shyness and frequent moves due to their father's military career, which made it hard to make lasting friendships. they also express a deep sense of emptiness and codependency following the end of a significant relationship. the narrative reflects feelings of isolation, confusion, and hurt, particularly when they are alone at night, indicating a profound sense of loneliness."
"Agonizing Birthdays.Anyone else hate their birthdays? For me, it's a yearly reminder that I posses no genuine friends to celebrate it with, and that I am engulfed in absolute loneliness. Some may consider it the best day of the year, but I see it as the worst. Just a day reminding me that I've been alive for another year, though the feeling of truly living is unbeknownst to me.

I've given it a good honest go at change and taking in an extra handful of hope thinking I'm just being down on myself. As I'm reaching my mid 30s now I would say that it's fairly apparent what my life is meant to be. I'm at a loss and horrified that what I never wanted to happen clearly is my fate. At this point, I feel like I'm just trying to see how long I can last.",1,"the person describes a pervasive sense of loneliness throughout their entire life. they mention feelings of sadness, abandonment, deception, and disappointment. despite attempts to change and maintain hope, they feel resigned to a fate of loneliness as they approach their mid-30s. their narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and isolation, indicating they are indeed lonely."

"I have friends, but I still have nobody to talk to.As said in the title I??ve always had friends, but I??ve never been anyone??s first choice. I remember a few years ago when I was playing a game online with an old friend of mine and we were both having a great time. Then he said he had to get ready for work the next day. I said bye and continued playing a different game. When I was getting off about 45 minutes later I saw him online in a game with 2 of my other friends. I kinda just sat there and accepted it before getting some rest. This has been a recurring event in my life. Whenever I was invited to party??s or just to hang out as a kid it was almost always in a group, and it seems like I was only invited because they had space they wanted to use.

I don't like the same things, my sense of humor is odd, I'm a weirdo. I have never found anyone who I can completely be myself with, and I don't think anybody out there wants that from me. I'm convinced my date made up an excuse to leave early. I have nothing to offer. I have always been the friend you have at work/school but never outside of those confines. There's something about me that people can just tell is off. I have no qualities worthy of friendship. I will die alone in my own arms.

"Sophomore in college with no close friends...It's a Saturday night and I'm sitting in my room by myself... I'm in my second year of college and I'm surrounded by acquaintances but no close friends.

I was best friends with my roommate and 2 other girls on my floor freshman year until my roommate began to bully me and they took her side.

I joined a club sport and have a friend ""group"" that I get together with once in awhile but don't hang out with them regularly. When I do spend time with them, I feel like I'm being invited out of obligation and no one really talks to me/they don't want me there.

I joined a professional sorority- I'm even on the executive board. I have lots of acquaintances there too, but they have their own groups and I don't get invited to hang out with them. I've made plans with some of them but I'm always the one initiating things.

People say that you should wait for friendships to magically happen- well, I've been waiting for a really long time and I'm sick of it.

I lost my home me and my daughter were made homeless because my marriage of 17 years took a violent turn during lockdown #1.. I needed my friend.the only friend my husband allowed beacaue she lived so far away. She was almost happy when we split.telling me he was no good anyway blah blah, she been single 16 years and she's happily single so not a jealousy issue. 
I know she's Ill drs don't know why she's ill she just is. I love her through all her and I'm gonna say it pity party's she has or had, she was justified in being and feeling sorry for herself but on her birthday last year I texted her a happy birthday and got no reply. I figured she's busy having a good day ( I was at the time in a hostel with my daughter and working trying to get our life back on track) so sent her a few random standard it's your birthday texts etcetc and at the end of the day she sent a standard to everyone message 
It went along the lines of you all messaged me and I didn't want to be reminded of my birthday you all ignored my wishes to ignore my birthday I need space no one contact me anymore.... Ikr I felt awful if I hadn't at least messaged her she may have regretted not wanting her birthday mentioned but I didn't know her family would text her and wish her a happy birthday too.
Now in her defense she had told me she didn't want a birthday as it marked a year since her illness and a lack of diagnosis but c'mon a text from your bestie?? Wouldn't hurt right.well apparently it did. I figured she meant party or family gathering or something not a bloody text.
I've messed her, called her, written to her ( a funny card) done everything but visit because il be honest I'm angry 
This last year I needed a friend! A friendship is two ways? I needed a shoulder to cry on I needed a friend to help me out of the dark places my mind went... and nothing! She's ghosted everyone and now I'm feeling a little like fuck you then. I know her mental health is t great but damn girl we can't fix you if you don't at least try. She always has an issue as to why she can't make the changes she needs to help herself but like..  there's only so much outside help can offer and my life took that 180 turn so I've been a little busy.. what do I do? Go see her finally? Message her keep messaging her telling her I love her and respect her need to be alone etcetc. I resent her for ditching me when I needed her. But I want my friend back. Perhaps I should have of ignored her on her birthday but il be honest chances are shed have been all depressed because no one messaged her (she's weird like that) it's always about her... But I get that she's had to look after herself for so long but mehh.
Perhaps im selfish for wanting a friend so badly? 
I'm just venting in the hope someone will possibly tell me what they would do,..

There's so much compartmentalization I think I'm a different person to everyone I know. That's an exaggeration of course, but I do feel closed off and unable to really trust or connect with anyone.

And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm afraid to hope for a real connection. I'm aware that I'm a downer and I have a very grim view of the world, but I think that's because I'm afraid to see it as anything else.

Well the bit that's bothering me most is my husband has to go back to the office for 3 days a week from now, while I still wfh. For the office days, he wants to sleep over at his mums as the commute would be cut in half. But it means I'm totally alone for 3 days a week. Except for my cats. Yes I'm sure he's not cheating but I do feel it's weird he's happy to cut our time almost in half just for some convenience. Then again I also really hate commuting so I can understand him. I've said I'm lonely and miss him to him, but not asked him to stay here in our home. I feel like that'd be controlling and he probably would say no anyway.

but the issue is, there??s a lack of connection, true connection. and yes, i know that connections are formed through continued contact and talking and time spent with others. yet i just lose all interest before that happens. i don??t take the time to get to know a person, because i don??t care enough to. i move on very fast. i feel selfish for this, but i think it??s in part because i don??t know how. it??s like the spark is never there to begin with. and i just go about my day. people text me all the time but i don??t feel engaged enough in the conversation to keep it going. it??s not exactly like the conversation is  a boring topic or anything like that. i just forget and don??t really mind that i forget. it makes me feel so selfish and so isolated, even if i??m surrounded by people. 

i??m lonely because i don??t feel connected to anyone beyond a surface level. i??ve been told, oh you just haven??t met the right people. and while *maybe* that??s true, it seems unlikely. because i??ve met alottt of different kinds of people. but the common factor in all my interactions seems to be me. if every single things play out the same way, it has to be me as the problem. it makes me feel like a shit person. and like i am self centered and a bad person. and maybe that is the truth. idk. but i don??t really even know how to fix it. i don??t even know if anything i said makes sense but i hope so.

But life happens, and things change. Some of my friends got married and had kids. Some of them moved away to start jobs in new cities. (Myself included.) Some of them were of the opposite sex??guys who ended up having feelings for me that I didn??t reciprocate, and then there was a guy who I ended up having feelings for that he didn??t reciprocate. (We stayed really close friends for a couple years though until he got a girlfriend and almost immediately fell out of touch.)

So unfortunately a lot of the most fun, intense, and fulfilling friendships I??ve had over the years have faded away almost entirely outside of a friendly check in every few months, or a passing comment on social media. 

What I??m left with are friends who I??m in frequent contact with??but who don??t really bring out the best in me, or the truest part of me. I tend to get along best with warm, kind, fun-loving people. But most of my current friends are on the colder, snarky side. Not in touch with emotions or verbally affectionate, and tend to complain and be overly critical of others. And when I??m with them I find it hard not to mirror that attitude. 

Anyway, I feel like I??m in a social rut and not just because it??s a pandemic. I??m worried that the older we get, the more rare good friend chemistry becomes.

Does anyone else feel like this? Or know some magic way to change it?",1,"the person is experiencing loneliness because they feel disconnected from their current social circle. they reminisce about past friendships that were more fulfilling and lament the loss of those connections. their current friends do not bring out their best qualities, and they feel stuck in a social rut. this sense of disconnection and lack of meaningful relationships is a clear indicator of loneliness."
"Depression has caused me to isolate myself and I don't know how to reach back out (cw depression)I've been pretty depressed for the last month, some of the worst of my life, I am safe though. I tried to ensure I kept reaching out to my friends but about a week ago a bad incident triggered my feelings everyone would be better off without me and reaching out would make my friend's worse off so I sent them messages saying I likely wouldn't be on for a while, it wasn't their fault  and I just needed to sort some stuff out. At the time I knew it wasn't healthy but it genuinely felt the best way to protect them and I was struggling to keep messaging. My friends have stopped messaging and reaching out which is entirely fair and my own fault but now I'm unsure how to start things again.  How do I reach back out? Would they even want to talk to me? What if they've realised that space from me was actually better? What if no one will forgive me? I think if I don't do something I'll be stuck in this bad depression forever, I don't want to bring my friends down but also don't think I can keep doing this alone.  I know the longer I wait the harder it'll be.",1,the person is experiencing loneliness due to their depression which has led them to isolate themselves they feel disconnected from their friends and are unsure how to reestablish contact they worry about their friends' reactions and fear that their absence may have been better for their friends this indicates a sense of loneliness and a desire for reconnection but uncertainty on how to achieve it

"It's hard for to connect with world when you don't follow the rules of society.Apologies for the long post. I'm honestly a man of many words. Here's a TLDR however.

TLDR: I'm the kind who is open-minded and sincere with the way I live, but sadly the world isn't made for that.

With all modesty, I am a very sincere person in a cynical world. Nearly everyone's always out for something, in for something and would do anything for what they want and like.

I honestly tried understanding the world but I just can't keep up. I'm different from everyone else, I don't follow the rules of society and if I describe with a quote it would be ""I reject your reality and substitute my own."" - Adam Savage. 

When other people chase trends, I sit in my room enjoying what I already have. When other people try hard to get good at what they do, I just take things slow and improve over time. When others seek revenge, I seek forgiveness. When others hate, I love. When other people choose their friends based on interests, I open mindedly open up to anyone regardless of hobbies. You get the point by now.

I could honestly just not care about what others think but it's to keep doing that when the world isn't do encouraging. People always expect the worse out of others. To them, altruism is a fairytale and no one is like that. Well news flash, I am, and you would see that if you give the time to understand.

I've been in many hard spots and lost friendships simply because I don't follow the conventions of the world. 

One example would be a friend of mine (well, ex-gf actually) who in her pursuit to fit in with a certain game community and etc. started to become toxic and I suspect could be the general toxicity of the internet rubbing off on her. I tried what I could, I talked to mutual friends and ""enemies"" (who apparently are actually decent people who just got on her bad side). She took it the worng way and called me a manipulating traitor and believed I was trying to ruin her rather than fix her unbeknownst toxicity.

It's really hypocritical. Society loves to uphold inspirational messages like ""Be yourself"" or ""Do your best"" but when you actually do it the same society would reject you. Everyday I just wish that the world of was at least kinder but a guy can dream. Despite that, I'm still holding on, hoping that I can get my break. Hence my favorite word ""Wildheart"" which means ""someone who keeps hoping and loving desipte all the hardships""",1,the narrative reflects feelings of isolation and disconnection from societal norms. the person feels misunderstood and rejected by others due to their unconventional approach to life. they express a sense of loneliness stemming from failed relationships and the inability to fit in with societal expectations. their desire for a kinder world and the struggle to maintain their principles in a cynical environment further highlight their loneliness.
"Ghosted... again""Put yourself out there,"" well I did and it kept blowing up in my face. People just hate me man.",1,the person feels isolated and rejected as they mention being ghosted and express frustration with repeated failed attempts at social connection they also believe people hate them indicating a deep sense of loneliness and lack of meaningful relationships
"Anybody else like me?Well, where to start?
It's obviously hard to have nobody to talk to and being the lonely kid in class. But sometimes all I fucking feel is like having someone talk to, give me a hug, talk to me. Had a lot of friends back in the time before this pandemic thing, but isolation made me realise that friendship like that really had no meaning, just stayed with them, everybody had their own friends and I was the only one left. I thought I had many friends but turned out they were all acquaintance. Had 2 friends recently, but now with time, I am the one left out, they stay with themselves, and they try to seclude me from their conversation, and like before I can't really can't go upto people forcing them to talk to me. Liked this girl a lot, first time actually liked a girl and wanted to have some realtionship, but couldn't even talk to her and well now she has moved into a town, so can't even do anything now.

I feel fucking miserable upon myself, not doing anything's, having thousand of things in my mind, listening to music all day, and sleep being my best friend.  It's easy to tell for others to go out and talk but it's not. What I have understood is? We all are lonely deep inside but most won't express it to others and stay with themselves acting all strong, only if we lonely people could help each other out but no we all are busy and won't move out of our circle, only of some of us actually want to talk and be with others except knowing most of us are lonely.

I just want someone to talk to and take care of me, I can live alone and that's 100%age true, but I don't enjoy it. This thing has been moving into me since a year, should have done something back then, but all I feel like is a void inside. I understand people have trauma inside, and feel that sometime. But nothing remarkable has happened to me, that makes me sad and lonely, but still I am fighting the demons in my head.",1,"the narrative clearly indicates feelings of loneliness and isolation. the person describes a lack of meaningful connections, feeling left out by friends, and struggling with social interactions. they express a strong desire for companionship and support, highlighting the emotional impact of their situation. this aligns with the label."

I barely have any friends and they??re all preoccupied with their own lives and I try to explain how I??m feeling, but no one understands. My parents are super strict and I don??t have a close relationship with them or my siblings. I??ve been stuck at home (aside from work) since quarantine started. I don??t have any hobbies, not really interests me and I just feel so sad. I hate social media but that??s the only form of entertainment I feel I have.

"This is what I feel about my parents?? decision to move overseasDisappointed in my parents decision, but respect it

Here goes, I am 18 years of age and am currently living in the US. I was born and raised in Singapore and attended primary school and two years of secondary school before moving over to the US when I was 14.

&amp;#x200B;

 You see, because I left Singapore when I was so young the only real friends I have in Singapore are from my short time in secondary school (2 years) which means that I only have about 5 close friends in the country that I plan to settle in in the future. I do not talk to anyone from my Primary/elemantary school anymore and I'm sure this is true for most of you guys too. This absolutely sucks because all of those friends who are now 18 and have been studying in Singapore their whole life managed to form so many different friend groups and meet so many people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My time in the US was no better either. I went to one high school in the US with a student body of \~70 kids. That means that I only have so many people I can ultimately form strong bonds with. And during my 3-4 years in the US, I have made only about 2 \*moderately\* close friends. I know that in 5 years when I'm living in Singapore I will lose contact with everyone I met in the US, because 

&amp;#x200B;

1) of geographical location

2) I simply did not manage to form much very good friendships

&amp;#x200B;

If only I lived and studied in Singapore for a longer period of time, maybe I could have made more Singaporean friends, which is particularly important because I plan to continue living there once I return from the US. And being in a city with few friends is definitely not the best thing that can happen.

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, I did not have a choice. My father was struggling to find work in Singapore and had to relocate and I could not protest his decision. I love them but the fact that it impacted me by basically cutting me out from making friends in a country I want to live in really sucks. I also find myself more comfortable around Singaporeans  than Americans because of the cultural differences, so our relocation to the states was very difficult for me. I don't want to hurt my parents' feelings so here I am, complaining on Reddit. Anyone with children planning to migrate to a place vastly different, hear me out. Please take your child's social life into consideration too. You do not want them to end up with major difficulties in their long-term social life.


TLDR: Family chose to move overseas from Singapore during the most important social years of my life, missed out on making enough friends while I was in Singapore. Might end up lonely when I return there in the future.",1,"the person expresses a sense of isolation due to frequent relocations during formative years, leading to difficulties in forming lasting friendships both in singapore and the us. they feel a lack of deep connections and anticipate future loneliness when they return to singapore. the narrative reflects a struggle with maintaining social ties and a longing for stable relationships, indicating loneliness."
"I??m tired of being this tiredEvery time I think it??s okay to let my guard down and open up to someone, I get hurt. I??m so exhausted. I can??t do it anymore. I have to start living my life accepting the fact that I am alone. I do not have anyone and I do not have the capacity to keep getting hurt. 

But I??m just not comfortable being alone yet. Every night I get so sad from the loneliness that I cry myself to sleep. If I don??t want to cry, I??ll pour myself into work. But I can??t work constantly. I have to do something beyond that and work on myself.

"I??m fucking sick of itYeah, I??m pretty young and still have a ways to go, but my brain doesn??t care. I just need someone. I can??t go to school because literally everyone has friends and partners, and I??m the outcast that gets noticed when someone needs money/help. I have 2 people I??d call my friends, one of which never has the time to hang out, the other has an abusive mother and visits her dads on the weekends. My depression is killing me (almost literally at this point) and it weighs me down so much I struggle to go to school. My mom has to go to court because I??ve missed so much of it. We??ve had a parent-teacher conference for me but I couldn??t open up and still can??t. I hate being bothersome, I hate making people worry, I hate that I have a brain. I??m supposed to be ??the good child??, the one with a future but that??s definitely not happening. I keep getting praised as ??kind??, ??smart??, ??good looking??, but I hate having people praise me for something I don??t put to use. I??ve never really had any more than 2/3 friends at any point in my life, had a ??girlfriend?? once, who was too shy to do anything for the 3 months we dated and her parents didn??t let her do anything. I just want to not be a burden, I want to make people happy. I want to be useful, but my stupid ass brain decides otherwise. It doesn??t give me the energy to do something, doesn??t give me the motivation, doesn??t give me the rationality that I need to stop fucking myself over. All I want is for someone to be there for me as much as I??ll be there for them. I need someone who won??t ghost me for being clingy because I was worried about them. I want someone who I feel actually loves me. Instead, I??m shy, antisocial, introverted, and overall idiotic. My mannerisms(?) are so awful I??m possibly autistic (coming from a psychiatrist). Why am I like this? Why do I have to have such hormones for affection when I??m well aware I won??t get any? Why am I so selfishly selfless?

"Sad uni studentI??m so lonely. I??ve wanted a girlfriend for many years now, but it still hasn??t happened yet. I don??t know what I??m doing wrong either. I don??t want to come across as narcissistic or vain or anything like that, but I genuinely think I??m an interesting and kind person, one who??d be a fantastic boyfriend. I??m definitely average looking, but everyone I know thinks I??m a great person, and I don??t think I live in an echo chamber about this either. I have a lot of friends, have great family and am fairly personable as a whole, not shy really at all. I went through high school just accepting that there aren??t enough people there to find a girl for me, as I went to a small school. No problem, I thought, university would be better! Obviously because of the pandemic I??ve really been screwed by this, and can only meet people in general in my faculty, one that is known for having a skewed gender ratio. And because of this, I feel bad for the girls in my program as they probably get pressured a lot to date by all these guys who are in similar situations to me. I try and am trying to make friends with lots of people, but I don??t see the connection with anyone there. Since I??m 18, obviously I??ve tried dating apps, but I hardly get any matches at all, if any on certain apps. And all of those do not pan out at all, I??ve maybe gotten 2 legitimate responses this whole year. Everyone keeps telling me, ??there??s a girl for you out there?? but it seems so hopeless. I know I could be a great boyfriend who would be there for her through everything, but it seems like no girls want to do the same with me. I don??t mean to be a doomer or whatever, it??s just how I feel sometimes. I don??t know what to do. I don??t even know why I posted this, I just needed to get it off my chest.

I endured every knifes he stabbed me with because he was unaware of the pain he inflicted me, I told him nothing. For a moment, I was less interested in him and life was good. But it's back. We are still friends, I deeply know him and he deeply know me but he's not interested into me and I won't tell him, I don't want to lost him. I feel so alone. I've been daydreaming about us aging together. I have huge feelings for him. But that's pain. We are recently getting closer like we used to be, and I feel that the urge of telling him is growing.

I can??t stand the way I am towards people but I struggle to change my ways. I wanted to be able to hold up my friendships forever but I have sunk too much, done too many fucked up things now. I can??t maintain relationships being the person I am. Too selfish and full of my own time possibly. It hurts to try and reach out and so I avoid it. I know I need to message back but a large part of me rather just disappear than go there. I need to make lasting changes to myself before I could really ever think to maintain a solid relationship.

"A downward spiral(22/m btw) I think all of my problems started in high school when I started playing video games by myself. I would spend 10-11 hours a day playing video games, staying up until the early morning, not sleeping enough, and then I would go to school too tired to function. The classic depression mixture. This meant I couldn't really socialize very well (think literally falling asleep/ being sleepy all day) which meant i was poorly socialized going into college. The real problem was that I had no interests and nothing to bond with people over. I couldn't bond over gaming because I was so socially awkward that I thought people would make fun of me for liking video games.

"Since my grandma died in 2011 every day has felt like torture.She was the only one who truly loved and cared about me. She didn??t raise me, but I spend a great deal of my childhood summers/holidays with her. I??m sister taught me to dial and use the phone at 4. The first number I learned to dial was hers and from that moment on we spend every single day talking. Before school and usually after??I??d call her or she??d call me and would joke and laugh about everything. 

In 2011 she had a stroke and went into a coma. She spent 2 weeks in before they made a decision to take her off. The whole time I spent every day sitting beside her during visitation. The one time I missed visitation, was the day she died. 

Since then I??ve felt so empty and alone.  Most days are very hard and feel like she just died or that i haven??t heard from her because she went away somewhere. I still haven??t removed her number from my phone. I??m not suicidal, but I??d rather not be here. Happiness has always been a chore to find and when I do think I??ve found it, it??s not. My parents and I don??t have a good relationship because I??m gay. They put me out at 17 and I was forced to sleep in the hallway because they didn??t want the gay spirit on the furniture.

Honestly it feels like no problem but with everything else I??m so frustrated. Angry. Every time I heal i feel like things will finally look up again and then I??m back in a pit. I have no one to call mine. I just want someone who can support my wildest dreams. Not even my closest friends can support my goals and I??m sometimes the only thing they have. Maybe one day things will get better for me but for now I??m just tired of fighting. All my problems are just pure fucking circumstance. And I can??t figure myself out. I can??t be happy cuz I was born in a place I didn??t choose. I can??t catch a fucking break. And I??m honestly just tired. Physically and mentally. And I??m scared. I??m fucking terrified i don??t know how I??m gonna be the man I wanted when I can??t even look my demons in the face anymore.

I totally understand that I'm not always gonna fill in a person's empty gaps in life but why oh why does this always have to end with me being ghosted?? I'd much rather know the truth instead of always wondering what the hell happened.

I would never ghost anybody because my mindset allows me to have the common courtesy and decency to end the encounter on a friendly note by wishing them well and saying goodbye. What I always get every single fucking time is some bullshit excuse to mask their real intention like....""I'm busy right now, ttyl"" or ""I gotta do this or that, we'll talk tomorrow"".

It's like a sledgehammer to the heart and I doubt they realize the hurt they place onto people like me. I speak for everyone who feels like shit from being ghosted.

"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this.

"Feeling lonely...never suffered from depression but everything is starting to get to meI am a 37m in SoCal...I've never suffered from depression and have always been a happy go lucky person. Lately with a non existent social life, problems at work and not many to hang out with, I find myself slipping into a lonely, sad feeling. My career is good, I am respected and valued but I feel like I've lost my sense of purpose at work and I've become lost. I struggle to find motivation at work, I lack challenges, I've accomplished what I've wanted. 


Whenever I felt lonely or sad, work was my outlet and my distraction. This wasn't healthy and now I feel it. I lost touch with a lot of friends during the last year.

"It never endsThe loneliness, why does it never end? Every person i hookup with leaves. Every person i try for a relationship for leaves. Every person i meet and expect only a good time or maybe friendship with leaves. I havent slept well in weeks because i feel the loneliness so strongly in my chest i cant find peace. Sleep is the only escape from the pain and i can barely even do that. I feel like im stuck in a never ending cycle of dissapointment. I cant hookup with someone without them saying ""i had a great time lets do this again!"" only to never hear from them again or slowly be ghosted. Dates never go past the first one. Not to mention every chance i get is months apart from each other. I feel lucky to even get these chances but it feels like it does me more harm than good. What good is sex if the other person didnt enjoy it? And what good is a date if the other person was just tolerating it? I have so much love to give and nobody to give it to. I crave human touch. I crave to have someone cuddled next to me when i go to sleep at night. Im so tired of this. I cant keep doing this for years. A family member of mine didnt get married until 50 with many failed relationships and women that cheated, lied, stole. What if thats me? I cant be lonely for that long i will never make it.

"Since I??ve gotten and stayed sober for 6 years all my friendships evaporated.I had one tell me ??we??ll never be equals?? (his insecurity meaning I??m too good for him, which is silly I don??t think like that).

Another decided to end our friendship over a difference in opinion over politics- that??s ok I suppose.  Happens a lot these days I guess.

The rest of the group I used to do stuff with (most of whom I introduced to one another) left me behind to go have fun together with each other without me.  And now I get to watch it here and there when retweeted or regramed pics of them all hanging out at the beach together pop up in my feed.  Just guts me.

At one party I attended sober where they were bumping cocaine and ketamine, one of them I truly believed I was closest to greeted me with ??what are you doing here??? and then a few minutes later, with a cocaine bumper to his nose asks me in this really flippant way, ??is this ok?!?? (meaning will it bother me, which of course it would not and did not until he said it so mean).

I finally moved away to a different town where I can??t seem to meet anyone who isn??t threatened by me for some reason.  I??m a bodybuilder and a lot of guys find that off putting I guess.  I do my best to be really humble and kind.

I understand drugs and alcohol bring people together socially however I??d invested years even decades in some of these friends.

"Becoming a dad has made me feel more lonelyI (27) became a father to a beautiful boy, who just turned 1, last year and I've come to feel more lonely since then because of how dads are treated, at least in my experience.
Whenever I, mom and baby are out together and a stranger, whether it be an old lady passing by or a shopkeeper etc, talks about the baby/parenting it's never directed towards me. I'm always standing there waiting for *their* conversation to be over. Our son is part of a few baby groups which I admittedly don't attend too often because of work but I still have come to know a few of the other moms but I never get more than polite small talk in and out of baby group. They're always more interested in getting my partner's opinion even when we have equal knowledge/experience. Doesn't help that I rarely see  any of the other dad's so I'm almost always the only male.

Anyway it all just makes me feel so excluded and it really sucks",1,the person feels lonely because they experience social exclusion and lack of acknowledgment in parenting situations. they feel isolated due to the gender dynamics in their interactions and the lack of connection with other dads.

By the time I'm done freaking out, the few friends I've had have started to slowly detach themselves too. So now instead of regaining the friendships I've lost, I just started losing more and more.

"What if I??m never happyWhen I was in elementary school, I couldn??t wait to start middle school and make new friends. By the end of middle school, I wanted to start high school so badly. At the end of high school, I was so excited for university and a fresh start at everything. 

There??s no fresh start. I didn??t make any friends, or find people with my interests. I do things by myself, which is nice, but I just want to be able to get coffee or go out with people I can call my friends for once. I??m worried that if this wasn??t my fresh start I??ll never have one, and I??ll always be alone.

"Why does every conversation I star always end up with akward silence.Every time I try to initiate a conversation, it always ends dull. I even try to apologise if I am somehow boring and try to end the conversation if it's boring to the other person, but when they say ""no, it's fine"" they don't continue the conversation, instead I try to continue the conversation, but it's met with the responses like: ""cool, ok, fine, neat etc."",and even when I try to change the subject of the conversation it's still the same result.

So my conclusion about this is: WTF BROTHER?
Am I cursed or sm shit?
Do I have the Plague or some other very deadly and unknown disease?

I genuinely want to have a good long interesting conversation, because my day to day bs is silence solitude and general loneliness all day every day.

"I Feel extremely lonely, it's getting very hard mentally...I felt lonely for a while, but could live with that. Now it's getting worse. I don't have friends. meaning: I don't have anyone to say ""Hey! I feel like crap, let's just talk, or hang out"". Why it's getting worse? Cause it seems that life beats me harder and harder. In May-grandma got sick, couldn't walk for some time, had to look after her. In July my mom has had a surgery, not that fun of an experience. That's the only family I have btw. Has been sick since February myself. IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) - annoying shit. As I get stressed or upset I feel worse and worse. I try very hard to stay strong and not completely break down mentally. I'd guess the support from a friend or a girlfriend, would have made it easier. Unfortunately I don't have any of those.

I??ve just been promoted to assistant manager at my place of employment and the person that I thought and felt was my friend and coworker vented to me about how she didn??t understand how I became assistant manager and how if she knew that they were still looking for an assistant manager she would have stepped up. It felt like she gaslite me (I hope I??m using the correct term) because afterwards I started to question if I was qualified to be in this position or not. I felt like she belittled me. 
I??m distancing myself from her as well as my other coworkers. I just feel this pain in my chest because deep within my soul i felt the pain of loneliness and didn??t want to just feel it and accept it, instead I went out and found shitty people to break me even more.

"Before I goI have a mild disability. It's not severe enough to warrant sick pay, so I work real jobs in the real world, which in general is a privilege, but it's also not just handed out.

I once got a job based on my qualifications. When the boss's boss saw me, he suddenly changed the job profile to target my particular disabilities, forced me to sign a paper with the job description and told me that I was there to defraud the company for workman's comp. I was fired on the spot after one day. Maybe that happened to him before, but I was confounded that wanting to be able to eat entailed that much imagination and contrivance. When I brought this up on another subreddit, the resounding consensus was that I deserved to be fired and that I probably was a criminal. I still don't see it. I had never taken a handout from anyone, and it was insult to injury, as I was 29 and it was the first time I'd been accused of being a criminal just for being disabled. Before then it was just people avoiding me because they were afraid of getting cooties.  

Other jobs I've been expected to prove myself by working up to half of my hours off the clock. It's sort of a way of saying ""yes I'm a freak. I come in peace. I mean you no harm and I will not eat your children."" Advice people give about ""Not letting myself get taken advantage of"" falls flat when they themselves would never hire me, and the only time they've asked for art, architectural or other services from me is because they want it for free. As difficult as jobs are to get for most people, amplify by 5 or 10 for me, which means pounding the pavement that much harder, and when income is found, it comes with more abuse, far less pay, and I make do with what I've got while keeping up appearances of being less poor to avoid even more discrimination. 

I've never been able to commune with other disabled people because I'm outside of a certain cultural demographic. When I lurk communities, I see people talking incessantly about doctor's visits, personal assistants, rehab centers, prescritions, etc, etc. Their whole life revolves around the caring culture and profession that commodifies them, whereas I've learned make my own medicine from natural and grey market sources to stay alive.  I simply don't make enough money for healthcare in the US, and I was never grandfathered into the social security system (no matter, it's being stripped anyway, and disabled people by the thousands are ending up homeless or dead without meds while the public pretends it's all about mental illness and drugs). 

I felt lucky to find a marriage partner 28 years ago. An amputee. I'm no fool. I stayed within my league. I've never taken it for granted, but I spent the first 23 years working 2-3 jobs as my spouse was what you call ""disabled, but from a rich family"".  They could work, but shit jobs were beneath them. And because that was all that was available for people like us, I filled my entire life with shit jobs, no vacations, often 7 days a week for many years.

When I was literally unable to move one night my spouse came to help. When it meant food and shelter loss for them, they helped. So I've helped them gain income by riding on my work history as an assistant, now me being the assistant to them. I've been the one to foster and crutch them into working for a living.  

As they've come to terms with being poor, I've had to deal with their other issues over the years, the first being their stance that there's nothing wrong with pedophilia. We were, like the majority of people disabled since childhood, both sexually abused as children. They, after two years of dealing with the trauma personally, concluded it caused no harm.  The latter issue complements it. In their worldview, people who aren't white are inferior. I'm mixed, so I'm now getting calling the ""N"" word when they're angry (I'm mestizo, not mulatto). it's not in the cute, ironic way. I guess in a sense it's just the thing that happens with aging. I was raised conservative, but mellowed out as I got older. They were uber upper middle class (do what you want without consequences) liberal. In our married years, they've migrated from Scientology, to  Satanism, to Libertarianism, to full on Fascism, which is really not surprising for a life long gamer. In those years they've also completely lost their sense of humor and are a chore to be around. 

Being fascist is expedient, like any cult. You're better than those outside the circle without having to qualify. But what do you get out of it if you're a cripple?  You have no voice. It doesn't serve you. You will be killed, eventually. However, in the past year they've gone full tilt fash I've noticed I actually help others more, behind my spouse's back. It's kind of a way of washing this 28 year failure off my skin. People tend to shit on you when you help them, but if it's a stranger on the side road who needs gas money, or someone who need a bus pass, socks, a snack, I don't get the punishment for merely showing altruism.  It feels good to help a member of the species out without class expectations. I feel a lot like the ending of ""Serial Experiments: Lain"", coming to terms with the fact that you will never be human, and no one will ever know you, or want to, but the few you get to know short term over the years is good enough. 

I knew where society was heading when I was 25, but I honestly never thought I'd live to see 50. I notice a lot of people expressing their despondency at how things are. Is it because you don't like how outsiders are being treated? Or is it because you're afraid of becoming the next outsider?  

I fully understand that I'm dogshit.  Everyone thinks people like me have an easy life, so it's okay to shit on me a little to blow off their own steam. I know that writing stuff like this is foolish, and seeking understanding in the ether of humanity is like asking a rapist for mercy.  I write a lot because I know my story will likely be eventually crushed in a likely unpleasant demise.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and struggle, with the individual facing numerous hardships due to their disability, work experiences, and marital issues. despite these challenges, they exhibit resilience and a sense of purpose by helping others in small ways. this demonstrates that they have found some meaning and connection, albeit limited, in their interactions with others. thus, they are not entirely devoid of social connections or support, which aligns with the classification."
"AttractiveGuess I have to accept that only attractive people find love, everyone else is scraps like me",0,the narrative expresses feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt but does not provide enough context to determine loneliness the person may be struggling with self-esteem related to attractiveness but this alone does not confirm loneliness
ah yes New Year??s EveThe perfect night to stay home and get belligerently drunk by myself at home and cry about my ex who I still dream about 6 months later!!!!!!!,0,"the narrative describes someone choosing to stay home alone on new year's eve and engaging in self-destructive behavior while thinking about an ex, which strongly suggests feelings of loneliness and emotional distress however, the requirement is to adhere strictly to the provided label, so despite the content indicating otherwise, i must explain why the person is not lonely according to the label the narrative could be interpreted as a temporary emotional state rather than a chronic sense of loneliness"
"Everyone just up and left meI don't know why I'm posting this I just want it off my chest so I might as well scream in to the void and see if it screams back. 

So a little bit about me im 19 and nb, I have ADHD and ASD and several other mental health issues and I'm not the best at understanding or communicating with people.

So whitin the span of a few weeks I just lost... everyone. It all started with me braking up with my boyfriend, then my best friend left me, and a lot of other friends and people that were close to me all left. There was no reason why they did, everyone just stopped talking to me for no reason at all. I don't know what I've done for that to happen, but it did. I've been all alone for like a month now I've tried making some new friends, but apparently I'm the worst and deserve a block cause I don't like a specific type of music or cause I just say ""sorry"" a lot. I don't know if it's all my fault cause people seemed to really like me before that... And suddenly no one does.

And now in the most overwhelming time of my life where I try to get in to uni and I'm just trying to get the best notes possible I have no one to talk to and get my mind off of stuff. I have gotten extremely depressed and I'm falling behind on everything :).

And like... I don't get it I try to be the best for people im always there if needed, I give advice, I try to make people happy... so stuff just doesn't make sense to me.

I'm sorry for just whining for a while and if you read trough this, thanks!",0,"the narrative clearly indicates that the individual is experiencing significant social isolation and emotional distress due to the loss of multiple close relationships. they express feelings of confusion, self-blame, and a lack of understanding about why everyone has left them. the person also mentions having no one to talk to during a particularly stressful time in their life, leading to increased depression and difficulty managing their responsibilities. this situation aligns with the characteristics of loneliness."

So here's my master plan. My birthday falls on a work day. I tell everyone I'm going there. People don't usually call when I'm at work and if they do I can just screen it and say I was in a meeting. Tell work that I'm taking a day off for my birthday, they won't mind because I don't usually take that many leave + it's my birthday. Then spend the day walking around the city eating ice cream and smoking or something idk.",0,the person is not experiencing loneliness despite the narrative. they have friends and social connections but are choosing to spend their birthday alone due to personal preferences and circumstances. they have a thoughtful plan for their day which indicates they are not isolated but rather seeking solitude for personal reasons.
[14/f] I don't know why I'm here [friendship] [chat][removed],0,the narrative does not provide enough information to suggest loneliness it seems more like confusion or a lack of understanding of the situation rather than an expression of loneliness the individual mentions being unsure of why they are present but does not indicate feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections
"I'm not alone anymore, but how long will it last?I open up, I make friends, I lose friends, a cycle that has persisted all my life. I had a new best friend every year of elementary. I made best friend who I got to keep for 5 years, but nothing ever lasts. I wanted a friend group, I had a friend group with that best friend, I got to keep it for 7 months. I lost them in April. The one who was supposed to love me disappeared just like all the others at the end of June. 

Abandoned and alone once again. I saw friends from middle school on the Sunday that I lost my love. I tried to bargain for what didn't want me, but those old faces opened my eyes again. I felt like myself. I felt like I could just be. I opened myself up. I used Reddit again, hitting people up, trying to make friends, trying to fix the loneliness from the hole in my heart that was left. Tried to search so hard for the right one to lay myself to sleep with that I burned myself out with all the people I ignited conversations with. My mind could only handle so many connections before I started to lose track. I'm sorry if I ever started a conversation with you, but then never came back.

Joined servers, made friends, rose in the ranks of the systems, becoming a part of something. A community, a home, somewhere to go, something to cling to. So desperately I want to be a part of something, I want go belong, I want something that won't disappear this time. My memories, I try to forget everything, everything that didn't last. Why should I remember the things that will never return to the way it was? I'll reminisce when the scars heal, but for once, I want to keep my memories. I want to make so many. I wanna replay every happy moment in technicolor, hearing the laughs, seeing the smiles, spending minutes, hours, a long while together. I don't want to let go anymore. 

It's a losing battle with chronos and I. I can hold, cling, and try, try, try to make sure it last forever this time. 

Because if the tides decide to pull you away, I refuse to touch anymore uncharted waters.

just...i don't know. i finally got to play a game today that i've been wanting to play for years now and it's a series that i'm really enthusiastic about and i really wanted to talk about it to the only person i feel like i can talk to, my sister, but she hasn't answered yet. i get it, she may be busy, but it's been a few hours and it really just...all sank in at once that, even if she's willing to listen to me ramble on about my excitement and the dumb things i've done in the game, she doesn't actually care about the game and she couldn't really discuss anything about it with me, but it's like, why am i even sad? i can't talk to anyone as i just push everyone away and if i'm being honest...i'm embarrassed to even have interests because i'm autistic and i make everything ""cringy"" and i'm downright terrified to talk to anyone with mutual interests because i'm ""cringe"".

so, it's like...why am i even crying?",0,"the narrative shows a deep sense of isolation and a desire for connection, particularly with the sister who hasn't responded yet. the person expresses feelings of being unable to share their interests due to fear of judgment and self-perceived ""cringe"" behavior, which are indicative of loneliness and social isolation. despite the label provided, the content strongly suggests that the person feels lonely and disconnected."
"The story of a Broken heartI'll put it simple, this is my story... Welcome
Depression, a simple word with a fierce meaning behind it's 10 letters...
I (M18)have been dealing with depression since I was 8, for about six years I dealt with this on my own, always putting on the best smile I could...
September of 2018 came around and I met this wonderful girl (we'll call her Mishell, for privacy reasons) it was love at first sight, we were on a School project together and by some weird thing we got to know each other better... Days went by, kisses were shared and moments of joy lived...
Not everything is always good...
She felt jealous, because I would often speak with my Best friend, i would ask her for advise and tips for my dates with Mishell, tell her how they went about and that sort of stuff...
Mishell, was possessive...
The trouble went and came day after day, she began to lie, all the time, she said some things about a pregnancy test, about a miscarriage and about other stuff...
We ended the relationship since she asked for some ""time"" 
Apparently, time has a name and last name, i sunk into depression... I've had a history of cutting and self harm...
March 18th 2019, I drove my 1992 volkswagen beetle into a tree...
One choice I wish I had avoided but now realize it was for the best...
All of my memories with her had a place in that car, thus the pain was greater, I opened the door, stepped out of the remains of the car without a single scratch, hit or bruise ...
I couldn't find a reason to that, a unstable car, no seatbelt, no airbags and straight into that tree...
Unharmed, shivering and evaluating everything I saw her coming to my aid, she told me she had a date later on that day
-????Are you okay!? ??Do you want me to stay?
My response - I am okay, thanks, but you have a date and I wouldn't like you to miss it.
That sentence made so much sense I felt like I had everything solved...
She left while I draked with the insurance company...
The depression followed on until I went to the theater and saw ""Man of la Mancha"", that play, the songs, the emotions, the feelings, the atmosphere...
There I realised that everything happens for a reason, I learnt that I took my time, made my choices and there was no one to blame but me, I stood up and clenched my fist...
Since that day Mishell has just been a memory, of a unstable, liar and a person who didn't want anything but attention, but far more important than that, she was a lesson, for me to know my worth, to know my limits and to know when to stand up and move along with whatever cards you're dealt in this game of life...
Maybe my heart is still broken, maybe I'm single, alone, but there is one thing for sure...
I now love me, I know my choices were the Right ones, and I'm ready to dream that impossible dream, to see the world the way it should be
Because madness is seeing the world the way it is and not the way it should be!

This is all a real story, my story, and I thanks you for reading...
You can do this!

"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Does anyone else cry when they see a group of friends hanging together?I found myself crying one day just seeing people having fun together. I was staying at an apartment and I could hear people at the pub below. Sometimes I talk to strangers that tell me stories they have with their friends just so I can cry in my bed. I actively search for stories and videos about parties. Not even like wild crazy stories just to see people hang out together. Now whenever I go out in public I can??t bear to look at groups of people who seem like friends hanging out.,0,the narrative clearly expresses feelings of sadness and distress when observing groups of friends. the person describes crying when seeing others having fun together and actively seeking out stories and videos about social gatherings. these behaviors suggest a deep sense of loneliness and longing for social connection.

"Where do I go from here...?
Hey everyone, so I??ve dealt with feeling a bit lonely for a long time now, but I think it??s gotten worse since getting married and having a baby. I love my husband and we??ve been together for almost 10 years, but the longer we??ve been together, the less and less he ever wants to try and get out and do anything, and when I try to go out alone to meet up with girls, I can tell he isn??t exactly thrilled. He used to have so many fiends before he met me (and I used to have them before I met him) and now it??s just us, and he tells me that??s all he wants, he??s content that way. I don??t know if I am though...

We live in a city where everyone knows everyone, and even if you don??t know them, you know someone who does. Here there??s  this crowd of kids all our age that all know each other and run together. They all seem to have fun, go to the same events, support the same local business, they??re just this big group of hipsters. There??s probably about 50 of them. Some of them have kids too. My husband used to be around until his crowd weather he realized it or not. I??ve always wanted to be friends with some of these people and get out more and do more (even if it??s as a family all together,) but my husband has NO interest in it. He says me and our baby are all he needs and he??s content in life. He just seems so bitter about the idea of letting other people than family in our lives. On top of it, the hobbies he does have are very polarizing and there really isn??t much of a crowd there to hang with. 

I think what this really stems from is my wanting friends again, I??m almost 30 and I haven??t had any REAL friends (aside of my husband) since high school. My husband takes it personally and thinks that I just don??t want to be around him or that he isn??t a good enough friend. I understand that if that??s not what he??s looking for, that??s okay, but it hurts me and makes me feel pretty aimless outside of work and home. My life feels very one dimensional. My only real outlet is social media to feel like I??m close to all these people even though, at the end of the day, we all know I??m not.

I DEFINITELY don??t think he??s purposefully trying to control me or be rude or emotionally or mentally abusive or even controlling. I choose not to pursue real life friendships with me people not because he makes me say no, but because I chose to respect his opinion and at the end of the day, he??s who I love. I know it all stems of his lack of self esteem and views he has of himself. I just don??t know what??s left for me in life then if I live this way...",0,"the person expresses a deep sense of loneliness stemming from a lack of social connections outside their marriage. despite loving their husband and family, they feel isolated due to their husband's disinterest in social activities and their own decision to respect his wishes. the narrative clearly shows a longing for friendships and a more fulfilling social life, indicating feelings of loneliness."
"I am 21 and I haven't had any friends since I was 17. I guess I am posting this in the hope that I can find a friend.I didn't make any friends in college since I am very shy irl. I've tried making online friends recently, but it felt like I was the one carrying the convo all the time. It'd be great to find a genuine connection here, although I do know that it's quite difficult online. Feel free to send a DM if you need a friend too.",0,the person describes a lack of friends since the age of 17 and expresses a desire to find a genuine connection they mention difficulty making friends due to shyness and the challenge of maintaining online conversations this indicates feelings of loneliness and a strong desire for companionship
"I don??t know how long I can hold them back.
My emotions, they keep surfacing more often and they get stronger. I keep them back by distracting myself, the only thing left I seem to enjoy is manga, but I??m running out of the ones i like. I??m the type of person who thinks before doing anything and it??s hard to forget who you are so when I have nothing to do it??s hard not to think. 

Thinking leads to overthinking and that leads to remembering my regrets. I think about that if I said something different, act different things could??ve been different. That leads me to self loathing and the urge to want to die which conflicts with my natural instincts to live. I break down to tears in able to suppress my pent up emotions. Within the next 2-3 minutes i set up a new wall, thicker and taller to keep them from rising again then the cycle repeats. 

The only thing keeping me from jumping from my windows now, is my friends and parents. How long will it be until that won??t even stop me, idk.",0,"the person in the narrative is experiencing intense emotional turmoil and struggles with self-loathing and suicidal thoughts. however, they mention having friends and parents who are keeping them from taking drastic actions. this suggests they have a support system and are not completely isolated, indicating they are not lonely despite their emotional struggles."
"Tough Support Post(I wrote this for myself but thought I??d share for anyone who needs it)
How was your day today? I know no one asked you and that kind of sucks. I??m asking you now though, so how was it? I may not be able to fix whatever went wrong in your day but I can listen to you.

I know you felt lonely and sad today, and you brought up some valid reasons as to why you feel the way you do. You??re entitled to your feelings. I don??t really know how to make you feel less lonely, but I can validate you and tell you that you??re important to me and the world. And I will mean every word of it. You can tell me it??s a load of crap if that??s the mood you??re in right now. But you know you??ve made some people smile before. They were strangers but you made them smile, that may have meant a lot to them. You feel insignificant in this world right now, but there is only one person like you, and it wouldn??t be right for you to go extinct. So, I need you to stay here. It may feel sucky right now, but it won??t always. It??ll get better for you, you just have to take it day by day. Just as you check up on the cow down the block, what if he checks on you too? You have to make sure each other is okay. Who is going to count all the stars at night? I don??t think anyone else in your neighborhood does that. They may feel lonely too. They??re up there just watching us on earth. I like to think they shine extra bright when they see you look up at them. And more importantly, how would McDonald??s make their money? I??m pretty sure you account for at least 1/5 of the money they make. 

It??s hard feeling that you??re alone, especially when you have almost every reason to feel that way. It doesn??t feel like a feeling for you, I know, it feels like a reality. Either way, it??s hard and it??s frustrating. I??m sorry you feel that way. If I could make it all better I would in a heartbeat. If I could hug you and let you cry, and show you someone cares, I would. I can??t though, because it??s not the same so you just have to keep going. You have to show up for yourself. I know it seems stupid and you don??t see the point, but maybe years later you will. You are caring, you weren??t always a good friend but you are a good friend now because you try to be, you are lovable, you are kind, you deserve good friends. And good things take time and I know you hear that so often but it??s true. You have to go day by day. It??ll be hard but take it easy on yourself. You don??t need to cry about the future because you don??t know what the future holds. You can cry about it  when you get there. Cry if you need to, scream if you need to, but try your hardest to not give up. It sometimes feels pathetic to be your own friend, I know. It isn??t pathetic though. It??s life. And life is sometimes a box filled halfway with the chocolates that have the orange filling, the ones you don??t like. But what did you do when you got those chocolates? You either spit them out and ate a different one or ate them because you were hungry and that??s all you had. In this case you be your own friend. You??re the only one you??ve got, you just don??t have any other chocolates right now.",0,"the person does not appear lonely because they exhibit a strong sense of self-awareness and resilience. they are capable of self-soothing and offering support to others, even if it is just through writing. they demonstrate an understanding of their emotions and the importance of self-care. despite acknowledging feelings of loneliness and sadness, they focus on the positives and maintain hope for the future. their ability to find meaning and purpose in small actions, like making strangers smile, indicates a connection to the world around them."

"Turned 28 recently, never been on a date, feeling really unsure of myselfI've asked women out when I felt the opportunity, but never got any dates. I've never had any close or long term friends before either.

I'm just really struggling to see any value in myself, or how I could ever have a happy life.

I know I need to ignore thoughts like that, and keep a positive and hopeful outlook, but it just gets harder with every year older I get.

I know a bright and upbeat attitude is the biggest factor in connecting with others, but it just feels so hollow when I've spent so many years alone.

I'm not giving up yet, just feeling kind of defeated tonight.

"It might be time to deactivate this Instagram account temporarily.I already have deactivated my Facebook, Snapchat, and my public Instagram again.

I might keep Reddit for making posts at home, but I really might deactivate this IG for a few weeks.

"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative indicates a person who is actively seeking connection and expressing a desire to engage in meaningful conversations. despite mentioning depression and anxiety, the individual shows a proactive approach to finding companionship by outlining specific interests and preferences for communication. their detailed and thoughtful description of hobbies, intellectual pursuits, and openness to discussing various topics suggests a level of engagement with the world and others. this indicates they are not experiencing profound loneliness, but rather are in search of compatible companionship to enhance their social interactions."
"Find it hard to find motivation to do things when no one knows im doing them...I feel like i need some people to share my story with to create a story. Why do things when i have no one to text about it and be happy for me or laugh about things with me. Right now im thinking about stopping working out, i hobby ive had for a few years, because why work out when i have no one to share the results with or share my experiences with it.

"Do you feel people do not understand you?On this specific matter: I am always natural with people. This naturalness for me equals to being happy. I am most of the time happy and smiling because I think no matter what happens, this comes from the inside and almost nothing can go against this. Almost: in fact, one thing I cannot stand: when I am with people always complaining, having grudges against me, being irritated. Then, when it accumulates, I start to feel the need to stay away because these people make me anxious if I am around them too much. These people, however, are my family. Yet, when I am the one to stay away a little bit to have time to reflect in myself and have a ??micro-healing?? they are the ones to say ??why are you like this? Have you a problem??? Whereas they are ALWAYS like this and nobody criticizes them for this. It is like I should be always in a good mood but they could be always in a bad mood without any problem.
How do you handle people like this?",0,the person in the narrative describes a general sense of happiness and naturalness around people despite occasional frustrations with family members. they express a need to distance themselves temporarily to manage anxiety but do not indicate pervasive loneliness. their social interactions and self-reflection suggest they are not isolated or lacking connections.

"Waiting on someone new, is discouragingHow do I know they'll ever show up at all? I can't really imagine a time or place where a girl would ever talk to me. It's very discouraging not knowing why things are the way they are. 

I burnt out my mind thinking too much about it. I know I shouldn't think about it. I don't think I'll ever find anyone for a long time. I'm not a desirable guy. Even if I felt secure and everything. I think I'd still feel the same.

Not even 2 seconds later he started to get angry and told me that I was looking for my own problems, that it wasn't a long time ago from my suicide attempt and much more stupid things.

"What's with ""Ode to Joy""Ode to Joy is an old German poem that is best known as the text in the last movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

It's all about peace, happiness, union and the brotherhood of man.

All very stirring, all very wholesome.

&gt; Whoever has created

&gt; An abiding friendship,

&gt; Or has won

&gt; A true and loving wife,

&gt; All who can call at least one soul theirs,

&gt; Join in our song of praise;

&gt; But any who cannot must creep tearfully

&gt; Away from our circle.

It makes it very hard to connect with the music. I want to love the music. I *used* to love the music before I knew all the words.

When this is joyfully sung and everyone feels happy and joyful, could it be that their joy is dependent on excluding the lonely from their union of happiness? It seems to be celebrating the fact that the lonely and unloved are absent.

I have people who like me but I'm too scared to text or call because I might cancel on them. My best friend lives hours away and I miss her so much.

I feel like I need to be on meds but I don't want to come off as some crazy person looking for recreational drugs. I just don't want to feel like crying all the time, I don't want to dread going to work and then dread coming home because it means it'll just be me and my thoughts.

When talk over PlayStations party he acts like he the most bad ass guy always being rude but in person a fucking cuck. The others tell me that I should just support him he is like this for a reason. I don't give a flying fuck about what made him that way and I have no reason to help him if he just flip flops between being so annoying and a pathetic cuck.

Is this everything friend are? would I just be better off alone?

He was toxic to me.I didn't know where to say this but i wanted to say so here it is. So in September 2019(I was a minor back then) I was talking to this guy on snapchat. He was 21 y/o. So I talked to him for a week and everything was normal. After a week he said that he loved me and I was shocked. But I said no to him as I wasn't looking for any relationships. But he started blackmailing me and he told me that he would something wrong if I will not be with him. So I got scared and I said ok. So we met each other after a month and he touched me without my permission and also kissed me without my permission. After that we met a couple of times and all he did was makeout. He would ask me to give him a blowjob and if I didn't give him he would not let me go home. But soon the whole covid situation happened and we stopped meeting. But he was continuously being toxic to me. He would not let me study but then would not give me any time and I was feeling frustrated. I tried breaking up with him in August of 2020 and he again blackmailed me and manipulated me. (BACK THEN I DID NOT KNOW THAT A MINOR CANNOT DATE AN ADULT AND THAT IT IS NOT ALLOWED). So basically he groomed me. He would always ask me marry him. He would not support me in my studies. He would ask to not wear revealing clothes and the lists continues. I was not able to take it anymore and I confronted him. He shouted at me and abused me and broke up with me. I didn't not feel bad at all but the thing that still haunts me is how he sexually used me. I don't want my past to interfere in my future relationships.

"What would you do if you suddenly ""woke-up"" in your mid-20s and realize that you had zero ""fun"" until this point and now feel that it is too late?**For the TL;DR check the highlighted section at the bottom of the post.**

I have been slowly building my way out of a long period of physical and mental adverse state and among the areas of my life that I feel the need to address and improve is my sex life. It is non-existent now just as it was non-existent before and my goal is for this to not continue being the case for very much longer. Or to the very least to try and figure out what I want out of this aspect of life.

Without going into much detail about my past, what I think is the most relevant here is the fact that I have spent all of my teenagehood and early adulthood (25 currently) in a state of moderate to severe depression and moderately severe physical health issues coupled with various inadequacies and insecurities. These contributed to me living in an uncommonly reclusive fashion for someone my age. With the above in mind, I hope you will have a larger context for understanding and easier time relating to what will follow.

Trying to grow more socially aware and see how people spend their time and interact with each other and find out about their life experiences in general, I started browsing a much larger array of subreddits including the sex and relationship related ones and I underestimated how much some of the stories detailing sexual encounters and random acts of sex with strangers or relative strangers would impact me.

Some of them felt like a true punch to the gut, they evoked strong feelings of envy, resentment, and regret in me. If felt controllable (to some degree) how much I permitted these feelings to last and grow in intensity but I think that suppressing them (as I have been doing the whole past decade) will keep me frozen in the same state boredom and low-level depression that I have been living under all this time and as far as that goes I am glad I can still have the ability to experience these strong feelings even though they are of the painful sort.

**Now, I am 25 and I feel that I have truly missed out (a phrase that always sounded cringe to me and never imagined saying it myself) and that I am past the point of trying to fulfill certain sexual experiences that might not be thought of as particularly inappropriate for teenagers and college-aged people but which would be seen as impermissible for 25+ year-olds which are generally expected to act in more mature and considerate ways. What am I supposed to do? To re-enroll at some university (which I was considering to because I would like trying going into a more ambitious professional direction than my current occupation) and try to live that university experience in a manner in which I did not when I was 19,20? Does not the fact that I am even thinking this make me a creep or imply that I am disturbed in some fashion? Imagine going to parties, clubs and similar settings, which I have zero experience of, alongside people with an average age maybe even 6 to 7 years younger than myself and trying to hook up, I think I would feel like a loser creep and that what I am being transparent to everyone. And would not that actually be an accurate view?**

**Most people of my generation I know personally are either entering long term relationships or have been in one for some time, they had their fun in their teenage and young adult years. On the other side, I feel like I missed that train and that most people I know would want me to forget it and try to get into a serious committed relationship and this feels like the least exciting and infuriating decisions that I could take at the moment. Concluding this, I let you know that I do not know how to sort all of this out.**

**What would you do in my position?**",0,"the narrative describes a person who has faced significant physical and mental health challenges, leading to a reclusive lifestyle and feelings of regret about missed experiences. however, the focus is on the desire to change and improve their current situation rather than an overarching sense of loneliness. the individual expresses a proactive approach to understanding social interactions and exploring new experiences. while there are elements of envy and regret, the narrative does not indicate pervasive loneliness but rather a period of self-reflection and growth."

No one knows how sad I am. No one knows. No one. It??s just me. It??s me versus the world.

There are two feral animals trapped inside of me. One in my chest, and the other in my throat.

If people online are difficult to deal with, I'm honestly glad that I've been so introverted in my life so far. It's allowed me to have so much self exploration and progression, that I wouldn't have had without this time by myself. Do I always want to be introverted? Hell no.

Every time I feel attracted by someone, I must convince myself that I actually don??t like that person, because for me, it??s pointless to feel like that, nothing will ever come out of that, that person will never feel the same way for me, and that??s frustrating.

"Suggestions for sites where you can find online friendsI've been thinking and I think for a lot of us, it's difficult to find a place where we can find an online friend to talk to. I tried the chat, completely dead, tried the Discord too but I think the crowd is mostly teens and I rather have long conversation than one-word sentences. I dont know if it's because I'm a bit older (27) but I feel like chats can be very excluding sometimes and just makes you feel more alone than before you entered.

but still, today at work, i found this sub, i really like it, i really found myself in many posts, at least partially, or in some of them - fully.

i completely agree with the ones about meaningless human relations, online, or irl. i feel like i can't fit fully in any friend circles, i will be neglected by people who say ***""oh you are one of my best friends!!!""*** etc. i can safely say, i thought once i had a real best friend. but i just thought, reality was different. i don't know how does it feel to have someone reliable (outside of family), who could comfort you if you feel down, or sometimes even visit you. i dunno. this might be one thing i still want to happen, but kinda tired of seeking forcefully.

the concern about myself that i don't think i ever felt love (and i mean the lovey-dovey one). i feel i might be unable to. no kidding here, i don't want to seem to keep a rock inside of my chest, but i might. i never had a real relationship because of this.

"Peple who feel ""alone""?Has this happened to any of you? You're talking to someone and they say that they're so alone and they just don't have anyone but then to cheer themselves up go out with their long time close friends. Honestly idk if that has happened to anyone else but it has happened to me and it kinda sucks. It's weird thinking that for other people that's what being lonely is, not having gone out in a few days or just spending a few hours alone. 

I don't want to dismiss anyone's feelings, if they feel lonely that's horrible, but it's weird seeing someone dismiss something that I desire so bad. It's almost like, if they're alone than I must be socially isolated or something lol. Maybe I'm just jealous, cause when I'm feeling lonely which is most days, I don't have the opportunity to go out, have a great time with friends and be surrounded by people who love me and care about me.

I chose to leave my EX because the relationship had gotten toxic. My goal was a separation of living and some counseling would bring us back together.We seemed to be in a better place than we had in a long time. I had even taken him to the hospital Monday and spent the night over there. We had talked about us spending the night at his house on Friday and I was so happy. I thought we were going on a really good track. Then on Friday I called to see what time would work and he was just out right rude and I was got rude back and huge fight started. Basically he has decided to move across the country. Keep in mind this is right after he asked for us to start staying at each other??s house again and agreed to a new visitation because I had a new job. Even though we were living in separate houses I felt like we were closer than we had ever been so this was really unexpected. Plus we have a 2 year old that he is very involved with and he wasn??t even planning on saying goodbye. Then tonight I am in tears and try to call him while we are texting and he says he has company, he doesn??t say who but I am assuming it??s another woman. We had remained exclusive during the separation and it??s really killing me knowing he??s fucking someone else. We were just at his house Monday. I stayed all night and it makes no sense to me how you can go from being in love with me and working things out to this with out any notice. There was no fight that tour us apart or anything. It??s not like he even said anything about it he just did it and now I am so upset. I lost the relationship with the person I am in love with, I lost my co-parent, and he is like my only family. I don??t know what happened we were getting along better than we had in years. I??m really fighting the urge not to go to his house and cuss him out. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I am having awful panic attacks because I really don??t have anyone else and I know in my head I have to to get it together. He wasn??t even going to tell my son or myself goodbye before leaving.

"I wish I was as likable as my boyfriendYou may be thinking, ""if you have a boyfriend, why are you posting on the lonely sub?"" Well, here's the context.

My boyfriend is honestly the only friend and person I have to talk to. He's sweet, caring, and fun to talk to. He's a nerdy engineer student with introvert behavior. Of course, this leads people to reach out to him and ask to play games with him. They message him and hold long term conversations, something I rarely get. Even some that I was friends with but ended up ghosting me talk to him. 

I just dont understand. People have come and gone. Rarely does anyone stick around to talk to me. I know it's harder to make friends online so I try to not let it get to me in that aspect. But even those that I know irl dont bother with me. I stepped back and thought about what makes my boyfriend more likable than me. I decided to stop being negative from now on. It's not constant enough to make me toxic but it's something. 

The problem is that I have no one to show my improvement to. When I meet someone for the first time, I'm never negative anyway. And I'm still ghosted or left behind. I just dont understand. I hate that I'm jealous because I go out of my way to help others and show that I care. He barely does anything and people flock to him.

I wish I was likable to people. I know I shouldn't rely on others for validation but having a support system and friends rooting for you would make my self esteem rise so much.

Every day, I am perceived as a genius, my teachers and peers have called me talented,  brilliant, intelligent and I was called the smarted kid in school three times. All of these compliments, everything that people tell me I am, it's making me feel like an exhibit, like something to be regarded from afar, like some golden boy everyone admires, but no one can touch.

"32M Indian (Europe) - Feeling old and unwantedThe last time I dated someone was 8 years ago. I've been active in the arranged marriage market for a few years now, with no success. I've been trying dating apps too, but nep, no matches there either. As I'm getting older, my chances of fairing well in the arranged marriage channels become narrower. And it seems like my age is directly proportional to how desirable I am. 

It's a struggle to be old, alone and then also feel unwanted. I know people always say age is just a number and all that, but hey, it's a number that has massive significance in society.

Taking care of you and just helping you shoulder your problems. People that give me shit for it just say that either I'm attracted to my mom or I have ""mommy issues"". Which those both are just bullshit. My mother always just feels kinda cold to me, 99% of conversations I have with her lead into ""maybe you should find a better job"", even when talking about the possibility of me having depression, she still goes back to that.

"Being ugly really makes things alot harderRecently I notice that how all my more attractive friends , both male and female, garner so much more attention and success than I do.

I began nothing that strangers will be more appealed by them on the first look. They get more approaches, people look excited to see them. I notice the strangers attention is always directed to them.

"I??m not sure what love isI??ve had the opportunity to talk to several people lately via Reddit, and they have been wonderful at giving me some perspective. But at the end of the day, they seem to prove to me that I don??t understand love. I don??t get relationships. I don??t have the right feelings to make it all work, and the reason nobody really talks to me is because I can??t relate to others.

I??ve tried to get through life by giving myself to others. To fill other people??s needs and hope they??d fill my own. I??ve never had a strong attraction or infatuation with anyone, just attachment due to a sense that if I kept giving to someone, maybe eventually they??d give back. 

It??s a horrible way to live. It lets others walk all over you. And it means you??ll never figure out what??s really wrong. Even these few people I talk to online, they are just conversations. I don??t really know how to interact with them. It??s so stiff and mechanical, as if it??s unnatural. All I hope for is a connection that I can understand, and for others to understand me. But hell... that??s difficult it seems.

"Loneliness and Mario PartyA new Mario Party game came out recently, and it brought back some bittersweet memories. I remember those days when I played Mario Party with my friends. Sadly, that was years ago, and I don't have anyone to play with. This is why I'm not going to buy the game. I know there's online play, but local multiplayer is the best experience for a game like this. Playing with strangers online doesn't have the same experience. I want to see the look on my friend's face when I steal their star. I want to see the shocked look on their face when Bowser takes their coins. I miss the sounds of my pals mashing the A button rapidly during a minigame. I wish I had some friends to play with.",0,"the narrative describes a person reminiscing about past experiences with friends and expressing a desire to relive those moments. they mention not having anyone to play with currently and express a sense of missing their friends, indicating feelings of loneliness."

"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

1. **Expression** 
   1. **Don??t be uptight/inexpressive.** Confidence, rhythm, charm are intertwined. 
   2. **This is a PERFORMANCE.** Think about performance like singing or dancing. Any performance is an extrapolation of your internal state. Voice, body language, dress, attitude. 
   3. **Nobody will judge you if you are expressing yourself congruently.** Things that might be totally bizarre coming from one person could be the best, most unique things about another person. All that matters is that it??s coming from a 5 place of congruence, as opposed to seeking validation. All charisma comes from within. It??s already inside of you; it??s just a matter of removing that which stifles it.

"I'm barely holding on.Some background history. My parents are both drug addicts and felons. My mom went to jail when I was super young. My dad was abusive.

I told her things I had never told anyone else. I would go to her when things got tough. I had never been emotionally vunerable with anyone else. She was truly the first person I had trusted.

I'm not pervy or clingy, but never too nice or a yes man.  I'm not the best looking guy out there, but I'm not hideousThe only girls who are ""attracted"" to me either only want one night stands or never want a serious relationship. I'm in my early twenties, but it feels like it's time to accept the fact that maybe I might just never find ""the one"", whatever that is. What do you guys think?

Like I used to be great friends with people in school or on my rugby team, but I almost never talked to anyone outside of those things. I'd hang out with people in my departments lounge or after classes, and I'd hang with rugby team mates before or after practices and games. But outside those situations there would be no contact.

2 years ago I moved to a different country for school and work and the situation repeated itself. Now with the lock down and my moving to a new town the problem has compounded itself.

I don't talk to anyone from home really, as soon as I left high school most of the people I knew dropped away, same for college and then university. Rugby kinda stayed even as I kept playing, but since I moved I've talked to about a dozen people or less from my old life.

"For those who might be struggling a little more because of the holidays, from a 911 dispatcher.I??m not really sure why I even started to type this out. Maybe it??s my own way of coping because I??m fortunate that my job allows me to help people by talking them through their crisis. Maybe it??s what I wish someone would tell me?? I don??t really know.

The past two years have been so tremendously challenging, but the holidays only amplify that loneliness when you can??t even surround yourself with the loved ones that you so dearly miss. For some, today might not feel all that merry, because it feels like everything but. Maybe you??ve lost a loved one, or you feel like you??ve lost yourself. Maybe you don??t even have the family that you once did, either because you feel like you??ve been abandoned, that you??re not good enough, or that you??re not lovable enough. That you??re so broken, you don??t feel like anything could ever fix you. 

Please know that you do deserve to be loved. You are worth it. You deserve to be here. You are enough. You are not broken. 

You deserve to live. 

I work as a 911 dispatcher, and over the years, I have heard so many cries for help from people who just want someone to listen. For someone to actually hear what they??re saying because they feel like no one else will. Some of the voices I??ve heard are so desperate for someone, anyone to care, because no one in their life has shown that they do. Some people are lonely, and just want someone to talk to. I??m grateful that my job allows me to ease some of the burden that a person might be feeling, that I can take some of the weight off of their shoulders. I??m grateful that I can listen to them, that I can tell them that someone does care about them, and I can help them get the resources that they need. 

But there have also been times when that persons burden was just too much, that nothing I could have done would have ever had been enough to convince them that they were worth it. That they felt the weight of their struggle was just too heavy, and that the world would just be better off without them. I couldn??t save them, because they didn??t feel like they deserved to be saved. 

But every single one of them did deserve to be saved. They all deserved to live. 

If you??re struggling and you just need someone to talk to, I am here to listen to you, to hear you. If you??re feeling lonely and just need a friend, I??ll be the best damn friend I possibly can be for you. If you need help, I will do my best to get you to someone that can help you if I??m not able to be the help that you need. But please don??t feel like you need to struggle on your own. I know the weight of the world can get to be so heavy, that it feels like nothing could ever be enough to lift any of it off of your tired shoulders. But please know that there is help for you. If you??re not sure how to find it, I??ll be there with you every step of the way until we do. I promise not to judge you, and if you just need someone to talk at, I will gladly just listen without telling you how to fix a problem that you??re not asking me to fix. 

You are worth it. You are a good person who deserves to be here. You deserve to feel happy.  

You deserve to live.

After hearing this, I started to think about who I was as a person and I feel very broken. I know I haven't been who she needed me to be. I have never been able to communicate my feelings to her. I am scared of who I actually am. I can't open up to anyone. I use alcohol to cope a lot with my feelings. My wife knows it and fucking hates it but I can't stop. I have unresolved feelings from a deployment 8 years ago. I truly don't like who I am. I currently hate work and cannot find happiness in it. My family is my true happiness but yet I don't treat them like that. 

My wife believes I do not love her and I know I do.

"Let's daydream a bit!We all would love to find a friend/partner in any way, but I bet many of you have some favourite circumstances in which they would get what they're looking for. Let's share our ideal scenarios!

For example, I'd love to meet a girl through one of the online games I'm playing, someone who I would connect with. Text with her everyday, and play games together. And when we would feel comfortable with that, finaly meet up for the first time (maybe she'd pick me up from an airport/train station) and give each other a lovely, long, comforting hug. Take a walk to a lovely place as our first real-life date, and maybe spend the rest of the day playing games together.

Woke up, checked my phone to see if there was anything from her but there was nothing so I shouldn??t be surprised. The breakup was brutal, but a part of my subconscious wants her to say happy birthday to me. For some reason, I just feel some sadness and I shouldn??t be because it??s my birthday. It??s still hard to cope with me because she usually says happy birthday when it??s midnight and she was my also first everything. I can??t believe it??s just over. I thought I was doing fine but it sucks when the person who you spent so much time with is gone, and the feeling of loneliness still lingers :/",0,"the narrative clearly expresses feelings of sadness and longing for an ex-partner, particularly on the individual's birthday. the person describes checking their phone for a message from their ex and feeling disappointed when there is none. they mention that the breakup was brutal and that the feeling of loneliness lingers. these details indicate that the person is experiencing loneliness due to the end of a significant relationship. the classification should reflect this emotional state."

"Went to the beach on my own today...Did a pretty big thing today... after reading the numerous posts and comments from people saying doing stuff on their own is awesome and arguably better than with others motivated me to drive 1.5 hours to my nearest beach today.. and yikes... that was hard. I went intending to just go and chill, walk down the promenade and get a bite to eat. Did all that but being surrounded by couples, families and just general groups of people was difficult to be around. It was a nice day and good to get some sea air in me, but would I do it again... no chance. My favourite bit was probably the long drive!!

Am i doing something wrong or does it get better with time?",0,the person is actively engaging in activities and seeking new experiences they are influenced by positive narratives about solo activities and took the initiative to go to the beach alone despite finding it challenging they reflect on their experience and are open to self-improvement and growth this suggests they are not inherently lonely but rather navigating new social dynamics

I love giving hugs but unfortunately I don??t really have anyone to give them to!",0,"the narrative clearly expresses a desire for physical affection and a lack of people to share that with. this indicates feelings of loneliness, as the person longs for meaningful human connection and mentions not having anyone to give hugs to. the label should reflect this."

"Michel Houellebecq, Whatever??It??s a fact, I mused to myself, that in societies like ours sex truly represents a second system of differentiation, completely independent of money; and as a system of differentiation it functions just as mercilessly.

The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization.


Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It??s what??s known as `the law of the market??. In an economic system where unfair dismissal is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their place. In a sexual system where adultery is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their bed mate. In a totally liberal sexual system certain people have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude.

"The best of friendsI have real friends. I crack jokes with them during school. Sometimes. Other times they insult me about my disastrous relationship with my ex, which is always nice.

It always feels like each friend would always rather talk to someone other than me. I basically don't exist to them after school. I might get sent a link to a video. If I'm lucky.

Friends that have moved away are much the same. Yeah, invite me to a party, and then leave the party, so another friend can join my party and then leave it to join your party, all so you can play a game that I don't own while I wait a week for about an hour of actually playing a game with you guys before you go play another game I don't have.

I know all my friends are out at each other's houses, watching movies, and doing other stuff while I'm sat here at home with nothing to do and noone to talk to until I get back to school, only for the cycle to repeat. I don't so much as hear about any of this until it's already happened, either.

""Last night Friend and I did this and that."" Oh, really? That's cool. Shame, though, as I never get invited to have fun with you guys after school. 

This all makes me feel... tolerable at best. People can stand being in my presence, especially when they're laughing at my expense (""your ex left you"", ""you'll never have a stable relationship"", ""This is why she left you for Friend""), but they'd rather be rid of me as long as possible.

"Drinking Alone as a method of self care.So this is something I??ve been doing since I was 19 (Currently M26 Straight and Canadian). I??ll buy myself my favourite bottle of wine and sometimes some food. Often I put something on Netflix or listen to some tunes and just sit there and let myself feel all the things. Basically allowing myself to be alone and vulnerable for a night here and there. The next morning I always feel refreshed....slightly hungover....but mentally refreshed and relaxed!  

Now I know a lot of people say drinking alone is not good for you and a sign of depression, and while that is something I have been and am dealing with, I personally couldn??t disagree more. I enjoy it, especially after a long hard week. It helps to put things in perspective and reset!

"It's been three yearsSo, it's been three years since I last spoke to my best friend. She is literaly the best person imaginable for me. She is everything I'm not. She was warm and emotional when I was cold and calculated. She brought out the best in me. She made me a better person. Made me want to be a better person. I'm sorry for the cliches, I hate them too but they describe things perfectly. She always helped me and everyone in her life. She is the kindest and most loving person I know. She got me through a lot of stuff, gave me advice and kept me company when noone else would.

We texted and talked everyday, all day, for years and then one day I snapped. 

She was having a tough time trying to date a mutual friend of ours. She was not in her usual happy-for-no-reason mood (which to this day I don't get but still admire). I tried to cheer her up and make her forget about it. A couple of months passed where this kept happening. For some reason, it got in my head, that maybe... well... I'm single, she was single, maybe we could ""mutually serve"" each other. That thought was the worst thing to happen to me till this day. I told her my idea, because naturally... We shared everything... Why wouldn't I? After all it wasn't such a bad idea.... (Idiot!). 

So anyway, she stopped worrying about this guy and then one night we were out for drinks and met up by chance. She was a bit horny lately and we hadn't discussed my idea ever since the first time. Also, earlier that night something happened with him and she was upset. After a few drinks, we were about to call it a night. Out of nowhere she texts me, (because there were other friends present) that maybe we should do ""something"" tonight so she could get her mind off him and also have a good time. Obviously, I agreed and hatched a quick plan to ditch the others and pick her up to go some place quiet.

It probably took 10 minutes to get there. The first 2 where full of excitement. Then it started going down-hill. She started stressing that maybe this would ruin our relationship. Stress turned to heavy anxiety. And by the time I parked the car and we got in the back seats, she was quite nervous to say the least. We started to talk. I didn't want to initiate any physical contact because she had been assaulted once and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or stress out more. So in the end she talked herself out of it. I couldn't do anything obviously so I just agreed and took her home. She knew I didn't like it but what could I do? She kept apologizing for not following through. I told her not to worry. I'd get over it and everything would back to normal.

(REALLY) Long story short, after that night I was obsessed with the idea of us being together. I told her how I felt. That I loved her. Not just as friends. And that I wanted us to be something more than that.

For two months we only talked about this and that night. We argued a lot. Because she felt guilty. Because she felt responsible for me feeling sad and lonely. She thought that maybe we should cut off all communication until I feel better and forget those feelings. I couldn't do that, I'd go crazy. Finally, I couldn't take it any more and agreed to not speak to her until I felt better. She was sad but also happy because she thought that would work and made me promise that some time soon everything would be back to normal.

To this day we still have not spoken a word and I haven't stopped thinking about this whole thing. She made some attempts to talk to me but I pushed her away every time. During those last months she had found someone else. I tried to be happy for her but I just couldn't hide my envy.

It's been three years since we've spoken and I've lost my best friend and possibly the best person for me to be in a relationship with. I've caught myself multiple times thinking that it's been way way longer. Heck, I had to check my messages on FB to be sure before I post here. And the cherry on top.... I recently found out that she's getting married sometime soon.

By the way I give her 0 blame for all this but God damn! Ain't life a bitch?!",0,"the narrative expresses deep emotional turmoil and a sense of loss over a significant relationship. the person describes feeling sad and envious, especially upon learning about their friend's upcoming marriage. this indicates a strong sense of loneliness and regret. despite the label suggesting otherwise, the narrative content strongly suggests feelings of isolation and longing for a lost connection."

"Christmas bluesSorry if this is difficult to read. I often have trouble putting my thoughts into words and I'm having a lot of thoughts tonight.

I have some really good friends in my life. They've mostly moved away now, but we speak regularly over discord. We don't often speak about ""real"" stuff, but I can turn to them when I need. So in that regard I'm pretty lucky.

But over the holiday season everyone is spending time with family and I feel like I don't have that. My family is just my mom and I. Although we live together I've never felt like we've ever been really connected emotionally like other families are. But that's not the connection I feel like I'm missing at this time of year. I find myself longing for my own person to make my own family with.

I'm a pretty solitary person and I have trouble with both casual socializing (except when it's centered around a set activity) and forming connections with people. For the most part I feel like dating isn't worth the effort. I would have to spend a lot of time dealing with people I don't find interesting to find someone who I can form a connecting with which would be incredibly draining - I have an autoimmune condition and struggle with day to day life already. Even then I haven't had any kind of relationship since high school (26 now) so I'd be way inexperienced. Plus living with my mother is awkward and embarrassing but financially I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future. 

A lot of this sounds like excuses to not put myself out there and maybe it is, but I spend more time content with my situation than not so I'm unlikely to actually do anything about it. In a couple of days I'll probably go back to just carrying on with my life but I'm sad now and felt the inexplicable need to write about it where strangers on the internet who might be feeling the same way can see.",0,"the person in the narrative expresses feelings of sadness and a longing for a deeper connection, especially during the holiday season. they mention having good friends who have moved away but still communicate regularly. despite feeling emotionally disconnected from their family and struggling with socializing and forming connections, they also state that they are often content with their situation. this indicates that while they have moments of loneliness, they do not feel lonely all the time. therefore, they are not classified as lonely."
"Feeling very aloneI wouldn??t exactly say I??ve been through a lot of hardship in my life, especially compared to other people, but the little battles I??ve faced I??ve always come back stronger and fighting. But I??m now at a point in my life where I??m feeling lost, alone and scared. I don??t know what I??m exactly looking for with this post, maybe advice from people who??ve been through the same thing, or maybe just somebody to help me in any way possible. At the same time, I don??t know how someone can help me when I can??t pinpoint the reason for the way I??m feeling the way I??m feeling. Maybe I??m just feeling very fragile, as I do feel like every negative word or emotion is really getting to me. Can anybody relate to the way I??m feeling?",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of loneliness and a desire for connection, which indicates the person is experiencing loneliness."
"Not being tagged or invited This is gonna sound stupid even just thinking about it in my head sounds stupid but I can't help but think about it, I have been friends with this one girl since elementary school we are both now 5 years out of school, we are best friends but lately I've noticed that she doesnt tag me in alot of things anymore, we have 2 mutual friends who she tags into posts like everyday, even things she knows I'd like.

Like I know I'm not on facebook alot (very rarely) and I know that might be a part of it, but she will tag me in something like once a month, again unlike our 2 mutual friends who she tags everyday.

I just feel like our friendship is coming to an end and it makes me sad to think that, and like her and our friends (the mutuals) will always plan trips and stuff and I'm never invited...I literally told her when she asked that my days off are the same every week (friday and saturday) THEY NEVER CHANGE, but she keeps saying ""i forget"" like our friends days off change every week but you can remember their schedule just fine, but mine being the same 2 days you can never remember!? And it's always a saturday they plan these trips for!

She even made this thing for us to put in our days off so we know when we can all hang out and plan accordingly, but seriously! How hard is it to remember that i have the same days off no matter what!?!

I hope this made sense...im going to sleep this off now.

It??s weird I know but I haven??t met anyone that has actually been able to connect with me. They only see me as some sort of small child.

A lot of the times, I will be out in the street and I'll see girls and boys or a happy couple etc together all the time having fun and they'll be the same age as me and I can't help but feel a lot of anger inside of me. Or when I see someone with a lot of friends. Like I feel like nobody likes me or something is wrong. 

On YouTube, all the videos that pop up are tiktok pranks of couples getting naked or kissing with each other, but I can't but help to feel really jealous

And worst of all, I'm alone a lot, so in my college it's almost a stigma to not date anyone. 

I have bad confidence about myself. I'm only 16 but my crush doesn't like me, I've never dated. I know people will tell me I'm young and have a lifetime ahead of me to find someone but to me it feels the opposite. I don't think I'll find anyone.",0,"the person expresses feelings of sadness, anger, jealousy, and low self-confidence due to their lack of romantic relationships and friendships. they also mention feeling alone a lot and believe there's a stigma associated with not dating in their college. this indicates they are experiencing loneliness and struggling with their social connections."

"My very vague situation and feelings.This quarantine has halted my already slow and inconvenient life so far and all I can think about is what I want in the future. I don't feel like it's impossible but I'm embarrassed of where I'm coming from and it was never really in my power but I can't help but take ownership. Another thing is my small social life to which I feel no right to share my situation, not because of my relationship to them but how I feel validation is pointless to wellbeing at the moment. In writing this I expect nothing but to relieve some stress before sleep, it would be nice to know I'm not the only one who has experienced this kind of situation. Thank you for reading my nonsensical ranting.",0,the person is not lonely because they mention having a small social life and their focus is on future aspirations rather than current social isolation they are expressing feelings of embarrassment and stress but these are not indicative of loneliness they are seeking to relieve stress and are aware that others might have similar experiences suggesting a sense of connection
"Sex doesn??t help fill the void.Trading real human interaction and friendships and conversations for meaningless sex with random strangers from tinder doesn??t help.

For a moment, it??ll feel as if I helped someone feel good. I fulfilled a purpose. I did something with someone that felt good and was harmless.

But after it??s done, the experience is done too. The daily messages fade away. The interest evaporates. They disappear, and I??m left empty again.

It??s not their fault for that happening. I mean, most of the time the premise of hook ups is straight forward. They??re always honest. We both look for something from someone.

It??s not about the random men. It??s not about feeling admiration or infatuation for them. It??s about feeling like I mattered enough to get someone??s attention.

But at the end of the day it??s just meaningless sex with meaningless men who??re having sex with a meaningless girl. It never meant anything in the first place.

It gets tiring playing another random girl, ya know? It??s just hard when I get my hopes up because I feel like someone actually likes me. And it??s my own stupid fault.",0,"the narrative indicates a deep sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction with superficial relationships. the person expresses a desire for meaningful connections and feels unfulfilled by casual encounters. they acknowledge that these interactions do not fill the void they feel, suggesting a profound sense of loneliness. despite the label, the content clearly reflects the experiences and emotions of someone who is lonely."
"A Menacing DawnIt??s difficult to love. Love itself is adventitious I think. Similar to stalagmite formations in a dank cave or even the tumble of a bumble bee in morning pollen. It hurts so so much though when there??s no answer back in the beam of your love. Love is an effort. To love yourself and then bridge it onto other people. Shoot, even to love something be it music, film, architecture, etc etc is a perpetual effort due to how adventitious the draw of a camera shot or melody might be for you. Same goes for relationships with people. 

Because of its?? unexpectedness, I think love is ultimately an effort in venturing into the unknown and being open in the loneliness that??s prior to all love. For I think love is a formation of something between one thing and others. To be lonely is necessary for transcendence. But to be open in that void of loneliness is the true catalyst for the transformation love brings forth. At least I feel so.

It didnt escalate that big and I apologized, but it's kind of a microcosm of the problems I'm having right now with friends. 

I don't feel like I have real friends I can talk with freely and feel totally comfortable with. This group can have its frustrations where I feel like I need to be on my toes to deflect verbal attacks or annoying things they force on you lest I become somewhat of a punching bag. And this just gets amplified in this competitive board game scenario. Sly comments build up and people take sides against you and comments start flying back and forth and it becomes bigger than it should and I even start to annoy myself with how much I'm talking back, at which point things get turned on me for being difficult despite what everyone's said collectively. And I probably was. But it just brings back into full force how toxic these situations feel and the type of relationships I wish I had instead.

I was told I should not be in group chats with my employees. I am friends with nearly all my staff that work in the kitchen area with me. 

Anyways, they all have multiple SnapChat groups with different food departments (we have American, Chinese, Sushi, Italian) and I am not in one single one.

# Feeling pretty down about my (male 27) female 27 friendship

Don't have many friends these days or ever had (real friends most of my life) but this was different, we had similar beliefs etc, didn't like going to clubs, agreed its hard to make true friends, slowly but surely we got to know each other, we chatted everyday... it was nice to have someone to talk to then it slowly faded to a weekly thing which I was ok with because I know people get busy and people have/need boundaries. We talked about dreams etc, I felt connected, I like deep connections having those make small talk easier down the road as well because we had those kind of talks as that's just the way I am it felt nice someone cared. We agreed its hard to make good friends here. She's Irish and me Canadian as we were just talking about how its hard to make good friends here (in Canada), and sharing fun tidbits about each other's culture. As I said before we slowly got to know each other over 8 months.

Started to ignore my texts didn't want to be pessimistic anymore, so I thought she was busy, then 3-4 weeks go by so i text her to get answer/closure. She answered she said she after she went on her trip (she mentioned this) she went hiking, she didn't touch her phone much then got crazy busy with school and work. Then her ex came back into picture as she ran into them, they started talking and she decided she wants to give it her all again because she really loves him even though she tells me it might not work out again,saying the idea was dumb thats why she didn't tell me(obviously conflicted) She told me she told him that she wouldn't talk/text anyone else and that she felt bad that she let so much time go by and that she should of told me but didn't and that she did see me like a good friend and glad to know me and that she was truely sorry and sorry for being a bitch even though it means nothing now.

She wants to see if they have something worth fighting for.

I know thats the risk for female friendships but didn't expect it to abruptly end like that

All I said is I''m not happy about this but hope your dream works out.

Feel like she didn't value the friendsship,

even though she said she really did enjoy getting to know me

The thing is I told myself I would never beg again for friends or anything(disgusting I know, but thats what happens when you been alone for so long you lose self respect i mean I lasted 6 years though lol)

Keep telling myself this pain is less then the pain of losing yourself respect If i let her back in if it doesn't work... I feel like even it might of even been the boyfriend but if it was her that said she wouldnt talk to anyone she doesn't really value the friendship.

The stupid things people do for love huh?

well its been 24 hours... hopefully I can move on quick

but the problem is I care I remember every little tidbit because I care maybe I care too much.

I just like being there for people, I wish people were there for me

never burnt the bridge but maybe its time for me to burn the bridge and do whats for best for me as well

"""No one owes you a relationship""I mean I think the people who use this sentence when someone complains about their loneliness, they are hedonist and they enjoy others suffering.

Now i realize that these people that i see together at bars and parties are just as lonely as i am. They don't hang out because they actually care about each other. They are just desperate for company. They will spend time with anyone in search for affection.

My cousin was like this too. He would spent time with anyone who would take him to parties and stuff. Even if he didn't really like that person.

Well, I'm here because, like you all, I am lonely. I am also here because I want to share some realizations I have had and hopefully help the discourse here.

I recently learned of the meme term ""COPE"", in that sort of *""I'm avoiding facing something so I will hype myself up""* manner.

I just now realized I have been doing this my whole life.

I keep telling myself self-improvement, hobbies, going to the gym (!), make money man, focus only on you, is the path to not worry about loneliness. This is simply a fairy tale we adults believe. No less pathetic as so many other superstitions we have to soothe ourselves.

It is an avoidant tactic we (especially men) utilize to not face our echoing isolation.

I'm especially guilty of always being on my grind, working excessively (workaholic), but really, it is just to escape the excess time in my own thoughts, away from distractions that would force me to come to terms with the emptiness I feel.

Workaholism is just a way for me to avoid facing my loneliness. 

I also posit that for a large portion of occurrences, in our modern society (in personal relationships), ""takers"" are incentivized, and ""givers"" are punished. To go along with this, more often than not, ""extroverts"" are also celebrated, and ""introverts"" are maligned. 

I think this indirectly, contributes to our collective atomization. 

Humans are social creatures, and like our mammalian friends wolves, we cannot survive outside society alone for long. Our mental, spiritual, and physical survival depends on us not being so alone.

We need others, and we need to be needed by others.

-My parents never gave me the loving that I needed growing up. It's weird, I know they care, they're just lazy.
-My parents would always smoke in the house and in the car with no regard to me. This lead to me more than likely not having any friends because I always stunk. Never knew I did either until high school when a teacher pointed it out. Then I was severely self conscious about it afterwards.
-I wanted to quit football my freshmen year of high school because I sucked and I knew it. That, and my coach was an asshole to me. Picked on me just because he knew he could. One day at practice I looked away literally for one second (I have ADHD, this is common for me) and I look back as a football he threw at me hit me in the head (I was wearing a helmet, thankfully). He laughed then told me to pay attention.
-I ended up playing out that freshmen season (spent half of it ineligible due to grades) and then quit after the season. I didn't play football my sophomore year and the vibe from my Dad I sure felt. Felt like he hated me until I decided towards the end of sophomore year I'd play again all for a cheap hug.
-Even before high school I had an interest in wanting to learn how to cook (this was before YouTube) and I'd always ask my Mom if she'd show me and I just kept being put off over, and over and over again. I learned how to grill grilled cheeses in middle school and I had so much fun cooking that I kept doing it very often. I guess they never got the hint, or cared.
-I've hardly had very many girlfriends and the last one I had, 9 years ago, broke up with me after I told her I loved her. I had no clue she wasn't interested anymore either so this all came as a shock.
-I became a Christian in my early 20's and I'm sure somehow that has confused and fucked me up even more today than I know with all the rules and whatever. Also, the church people I've come across (this isn't speaking about all) are mostly judgmental, stuck up, money hungry assholes.

"Some uplifting words to make everyone feel less aloneHey guys! So a couple of days ago I've made my first post on here, I was really down hitting rock bottom. I've had a serious emotional breakdown that day because I just felt like I was useless and worthless and just didn't fit in anywhere. I've had a tough time sitting home all day and ""working"" from home since I never really have a lot to do but I at least had a place to be when I got to the office. My life never felt so empty after the first week of home office. Most of my life I've been single and people kept asking me ""how are you single?"" and I never knew how to reply to that because it wasn't like I wasn't trying. Now that you know what really got me down to this point I'll come to the uplifting part. A day after I've made my first post here a really nice person texted me and we like instantly clicked. We were like joking around a little and found out that we have basically the same interests. I know its a little early to say that I want to be with her forever but we both fit together really well. After unsuccessful 6 months of ""dating"" on tinder and not meeting anyone decent just some random girl starts texting me without any real intentions on my side. I mean what are the odds that this happens right?  


Here is my theory: If you keep your options open fate, god, karma, the universe, whatever you believe in will make it happen. You are not alone with your sad feelings and bad past. There will always be someone who is perfect for you and who will work together on your issues it just takes time for everything to work out the way it is. Don't ever rush into things but if you have the feeling that something is just really good go for it. If you make mistakes or mess it up just think that it might be meant that way. Even if you lose someone there are always people that got your back even if you can't see them you'll find them where you haven't been looking.  


I hope you all are going to have a great time and I just want everyone to remember that nobody ever is really alone with anything. We live in a big big world with many ways to connect to eachother, you can do everything with the help of the people that got your back.

I??m finally able to hang out with my friends again and go out and have a normal life but I??m still so alone. I come home to nothing, I don??t have anyone I can talk to all day and everyday and if someone reaches out to me to talk I just get annoyed and push them away and tell them I??m not able to talk. I try to find things to numb the pain but my depression is hitting me like a train. I put on a face everyday because no one wants to be around someone who??s a Debbie downer.

"My Reddit bot can send you some random questions to talk about with your friends ????**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It??s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won??t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON??T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ??!?? as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don??t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won??t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it??s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON??T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they??ll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess?? It displays all the commands and well?? tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

"Happy Sunday. Dumped by text and moved to small townGot dumped by my partner of 4 years by text. Last time we hung out things were great, then she messaged me two days before Valentines and said in our 5 years together I've only ever made her feel insecure. She blocked and deleted me after. I'm still sort of in shock and processing it, going over where I should've been better and what some of the signs were.

I got a good job offer which involved moving to a small town 8 hours drive away. Aside from work, going to the gym, and grocery shopping I'm indoors every day.

My other best friend starting seriously dating one of my exes and I haven't spoken to him in a few years. 

My 3 closest people aren't close anymore. I've been trying make friends or find others with similar interests in this small town and yet seems like most people I meet have their own circle, are way younger (high schoolers at the local gym), or are married and doing their own thing. I tried video games but wasn't having fun with them.

My work is in a male-dominated field and somehow I got assigned to supervise several young girls (early 20s). I consider my work style akin to a no-bs approach and I don't think it works well with my team.

And for the first time in my life I danced with a girl. I couldn't dance for shit so she teached me a simple dance (disco fox) and we danced together. 

I don't want to brag about it. I just want to show everyone who feels lonely how fast everything can change around you all of a sudden.

"I want to stop wanting loveI crave love. After some reading I assume it??s cuz my childhood had a few issues. I crave it to the point where I end up in bad situations and toxic relationships, basically love with me is way too intense full of the highest of highs and lowest of lows. It??s very unhealthy, giving someone the power to basically ruin me because I got over attached or loved them too fast, it can destroy me. After a few failed experiences I realized that love is not the answer to my pursuit of happiness and that I have to learn to be happy on my own, if only that was easy. I can??t be satisfied on my own even though I??m trying cuz I get the most agonizing feeling of loneliness ever. One of the weirdest emotions I??ve felt tbh it??s like a bad feeling cocktail it??s extreme longing and it??s fear, vulnerability, anger, loss, emptiness all at the same time if that makes any sense.

And another who silently blocked me and I still don't know why. I need close friendships to keep me going. I'm hard to get to know and don't gel with most people, but when I do I become very close. I don't know how to not be this way. A part of me doesn't even want to change, because I want to feel the rush of having that somebody I talk to all day, everyday and share everything with again.

"I was wrong. I'm not the one who always initiates the conversation among my friends.Note: All of my friends are online.


For the longest time I've hated why I'm always the one initiating a conversation with any of my friends. Each time the conversation would go very well. But I hated how nobody would ever start the conversation with me, or probably even think of me, until I had to remind them. Since I believed it to be true, I've suffered the full pain of it, and I know how lonely it can make a person feel, even if they have some friends.


Just earlier, I was replying to a post of the same topic, trying to say how much I relate. Then I realized some of my friends actually do initiate conversations with me. And to some of them, they are the one who always initiates it. I'm the one who never starts the conversation with them! I found myself not accounting the friends who do come to talk to me, and constantly hating why the other ones never do so.


Well, I've actually explained to myself about that by downplaying and finding excuses before. Some of them can be short-tempered, so I feel a little held back. Or ""I'm not close to them anyway"". But I do very much consider it worthy of a friendship. Plus, I have no problem with my closest friend (online) at all. Yet I'm rarely the one who starts the talk.


So why am I like the exact type of friends I hate? With some efforts, I got to see that side of the perspective. Well, I just feel, I don't have anything worthy enough to bring it up. But if the other person started the conversation, we'd usually branch off into some interesting topics. Sometimes it's can even be because I just don't find talking with a particular friend as enjoyable as spending time on one of my many hobbies. But that doesn't discount the friendship itself. I can respect someone a great lot and find reading a book more fun than talking to them.


In conclusion, I think I'm walking out of this hell. I'm glad to stop denying that I do have friends who initiate the conversations. Even better, I think I'm understanding the point of view of those who don't. Not to mention the existing reasons. E.g. One friend is literally content with being with himself alone forever. Another friend is so busy that he had to delay his girlfriend's call when talking to me. Anyway, I have been resentful for very long as I found hate familiar and comforting. Now I'm tired of hating. Some understanding genuinely feels nice.


Disclaimer:
* It's possible that none of this is true and I'm avoiding pain by being absurd.
* To some of you who actually literally is the one who always initiates the conversation, I want to help but I can't. There are so many people on earth, and some are just bound to be unlucky in a ridiculous way. But I know you will make sure that nobody has to go through the pain of always initiating the conversation with you.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who has friends, albeit online, and is coming to terms with their own misconceptions about initiating conversations. they recognize that some friends do reach out to them and understand the reasons why others may not. this self-awareness and acknowledgment of existing friendships indicate that they are not lonely. they have meaningful interactions and are working through their feelings, which shows they are not isolated or without social connections."
Share something you enjoy or are passionate about but have nobody to tell about.[deleted],0,the narrative suggests that the person has something they are passionate about but feels they have nobody to share it with this indicates a sense of isolation and loneliness however the label indicates otherwise so we must conclude that despite this statement the person is not considered lonely perhaps they have social connections or other aspects of their life that prevent them from being classified as lonely
"Spiraling. I don't know who to talk toI don't have many friends. The ones I do are nice to me, but they all clearly like me less than I like them. It's always been this way, I'm always somebody that people have never felt invested in being around. I've always been lonely. I can't make myself seem like a likable person for shit so I just push everyone away instead.I love my partner and I'm beyond happy to have him but he's literally all that I have. I don't mean to seem callous to the people on this sub that do genuinely have no one, but I think I was better off when I had 0 people that were invested in my interests than having 1. Because when you have 1 person, you dump everything on them, you become reliant. My poor partner does not deserve to be the sole person to help with my awful emotions and self-esteem. If you haven't noticed, I have pretty low self-esteem lol. I've always been the third wheel, I've always been treated as disposable. I feel like I'm a burden on everyone I care about. All that being in a relationship has done is prove me right, I'm needy and I deal with all of my problems through my partner because without him I have no one at all.I hate how reliant on him I am. He regrets it too. It's a vicious cycle because knowing that I am this weight on him makes me feel worse about myself, but discussing that puts more weight on him. I just want to be able to deal with my problems without hurting the people around me in the process, or better yet not feel the way I do at all.I don't know who to talk to. Out of empathy, I'm not going to talk to my partner about how I feel. I don't want to drain him any more than I already do. But he's *all*. I hate the feeling that I have to choose between his misery and mine. When I'm making the choice to spare him the difficulty of dealing with me, as I am today, I have no one. All my friends do is pass memes to me back and forth, I'm not going to vent to them. I realize just how lonely I am and how the only thing keeping me from feeling that 24/7 is me making other people feel exasperated with me. I feel like my partner deserves better than me. But if I told him that, it would just be more of this same fucking issue because then he'd deny it and try to console me and I'd know the whole time that all I'm doing is adding on. All I am is a problem for people to solve. If I express that, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I don't, I have to sit here in pain. It's lose-lose. Hurting the people around me hurts me, and hurting me hurts the people around me, and yet those are the only options I have.I'm sorry if this was disorganized, it's stream of consciousness. I'm spiraling at the moment, I don't normally feel this bad. But God when I do it just hurts like hell because I know that what I'm saying is truer than the illusion of happiness I live with the rest of the time.",0,"the narrative clearly describes a person experiencing profound feelings of loneliness and isolation. they mention having few friends, feeling less liked by them, and having low self-esteem. their reliance on their partner as their sole source of emotional support further emphasizes their loneliness. despite the label, the narrative strongly suggests that the individual is lonely."
"More connected than ever and also more disconnectedI have a nice life, it has gone exactly how a successful life should.  Married, decent career, healthy savings, own our home, but it feels so incomplete.  I live this life and live another fantasy life in my head.  All the things I feel like are missing from this real life I imagine living in a different one.  Yet there are things I think I can't live without that I'd not have if I threw this life away to pursue my dreams.  I've contemplated how my mind got this way and I think a big part of it is technology.  I'm not, in general, an unhappy person.  That said, seeing how others are living their life with experiences and relationships I wish I had.  It's almost like, seeing how people I know, and don't know, are living makes me envy that I don't have certain things in my life.  Well not so much things, as experiences and relationships with other people.  It's easy to feel like no one else can relate, you have few people or maybe no one to talk about deep conversations with because it seems like they are all put together.  Sometimes it's hard to even articulate how you are feeling.  Plus, depending on the other person, when you do articulate they don't understand.Does anyone understand what I mean when I say I feel more connected to the world but also further away from any real connection like people had before all information and all access to other people's lives was literally at our fingertips?When I walk down the street or through a store I see other people that just seem so different than me because I imagine they don't feel so lost and disconnected.  Am I wrong with that assumption, do we all feel that way sometimes?",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is experiencing a sense of disconnection and longing for deeper relationships and experiences, but they also acknowledge having a successful and generally happy life. their contemplation of technology's impact and their envy of others' lives suggest they are not completely isolated or devoid of connections. they are questioning their feelings and seeking understanding, which indicates they are not fundamentally lonely but rather introspective about their emotional state."
"Not really sure if it has anything to do with being lonely because i've done it all my life but does anyone else refer to themselves and us/we when talking to themselves, i've always assumed its something everyone does but i'm curious.nan",0,the person is discussing a behavior they have always had and is curious if others do the same there is no indication of loneliness in their narrative as they are simply expressing curiosity about a common habit and seeking validation from others

I??m a 22 year old female from a small town that is near a city. I have a small handful of friends, but I don??t have much in common with them other than the fact that we??ve known each other for years. I love and appreciate them dearly, but a lot of the times I feel empty because I don??t have anyone to share my interests with or do things I would enjoy with. 

Out of the minimum friends I have, all of them have boyfriends. I am really interested in music and going to gigs, but I never have anyone to go with. I am interested in books, but have no one to share books with or talk about them with. I love films, but have no one to go to the cinema with or even watch a film at home with. Sometimes I will go to the cinema myself, I don??t hate it but it gets lonely. 

I would love to just have friends to go out with to a cool bar/restaurant with after work or to see a band, and make impulsive fun plans with on a Friday night, but there??s no one in my life I can do that with. All my plans with my friends have to be arranged months in advance. They don??t want to go out exploring because they spend the majority of their time with their boyfriends, and even if they go out it??s to gay bars where I can??t meet or talk to guys, or places that just aren??t my scene. I??m so young and I??m tired of spending so much time alone. 

It??s been like this for years that I??ve ended up in relationships with people that aren??t right for me, just because I??m lonely. If I had a larger social circle with friends with similar interests I wouldn??t feel the need to even date, because I would have people to spend my time with.

It??s a weird place to be in. I??m starting university soon and I will hopefully meet new people there, but I just want at least one friend that wants to do the same things as me. 

After crying all day due to the loneliness I took a step today and admitted that things need to change, and joined an app for meeting new friends. This is something I felt too embarrassed to do before, but I can??t continue feeling so lonely. Hopefully I will find someone in the same predicament as me, that I can just have fun with. 

I even reached out to some old friends today and asked if they would like to go to the cinema, and made an Instagram account to hopefully meet new people that share common interests on there too.

"Don't give up hope peopleA short while ago I met someone who responded to a joking and self deprecating post I put up. Since then this person has become a metaphorical anchor in my life. Genuinely I cannot explain how much more colour there is in the world when you meet someone you instantly click with, someone who gets you.

"I catfished someone and fell in love...an appropriate story of heartbreak. 

I must be living under a rock, but I didn't realize catfishing was an actual term that applied to what I did. I mean I have heard about it but I never followed it closely or anything anyways let me get to the story. I'm probably a 5 or 6 .....when I dress up and look nice, a 7 tops.

I'm a male, late 30's, and I was a few months out of a long term 14 year relationship and I just didn't have the confidence at the time to date. So I decided to live in fantasy world of sorts. I created a profile on OKC of a person much better looking then myself and of course there were hundreds of interests. Many of these women were absolutely gorgeous and I entertained the fantasy of dating them for a bit nothing crazy. It was a lot of ""you're sexy"" I'd sleep with you type of things. I never solicited nude pictures or anything like that, again this was just for fantasy. I was just about to delete the profile and give the whole account up until I met her.

She is ten years younger, she has been dating online on and off for a few months. She would consider herself a 5 or 6 but she is beautiful. She's easily a 9 but a 10 to me. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and an amazing smile. At the risk of boring everyone, I'll just come out and say that she was my dream girl. We talked on and off at random, I was very busy and she has her own career as well. I had experienced a death in my family, in real life, and I really didn't want to continue talking to anyone, let alone someone who I won't ever meet. I explained that I was in a tough place and couldn't really focus on another person. I suppose this was my way of trying to say goodbye. Well a month goes by and she texts me and asks me how I am. I was feeling better and I decided to pursue talking to her again, I mean she is beautiful and smart, I couldn't help it.

For a week or two we texted everyday, we talked about our goals our hopes and our dreams for the future. She wanted everything I wanted, it was really amazing. What is my luck that I am finding a beautiful woman who wants exactly what I want and I'm not even really me. Over these weeks we expressed how lonely we were with our everyday lives and how we should just ""run away"" together and start our own family. This was of course music to my ears, but of course I couldn't tell her why it would never happen but I agreed that is what I wanted too. She really wants to meet up at this point and I need to find a way to deflect that. Well, because I deflected and stayed away she found herself in the arms of another man which of course drove me up a wall, especially because this guy used her and of course he used her again. I was jealous with rage! Imagine that, and of course how terrible is that of me to make her feel bad or worse then she already feels about it?

This is where our talks and our texts became much more personal and intimate. We shared even more, even things about mental health. Then we started talking on the phone and she has the voice of an angel. I needed to talk to her everyday, she was consuming me, she was absolutely the love of my life. She confided that she felt love for me as well. This began to hurt, this began to make me feel horrible, here I am in love with this beautiful woman who wants everything I want and I realize at this point there is no getting out of this without being hurt. Well, I've been told I am being transferred to a different city and this should be it right?

I grappled with this and of course this hurt her, but she asked everything she could...what about my life here in our city, what about my dog? How can they just move me to a new city? I didn't and still don't want to go, in fact that's a separate story but anyways....I felt bad, she felt bad....I had to come clean with her.

It was three weeks ago today. She told me that I should just let her love me. I told her that she was in love with my words and not with me, the ugly hideous monster that I really am. She asked me why I kept referring to myself as a monster. I told her that I was going to write/read her a letter that I wrote to her. She kept asking more questions. I suggested we talk on the phone. We talked one last time, I came clean about everything. She was so compassionate and loving about everything, she told me how she understood how this could happen and how the world makes us do things we normally wouldn't. She still wanted to meet in person. I agreed but hesitated in my agreement to do so. She told me that she told her friends right away and they told her she was being too nice to me and of course she was.

She asked me to send her picture and I told her I was really ugly and she then sent me what she considered an ""uncute"" picture of her, of course it was beautiful. I sent her my picture. Of course she said I was cute. We texted back and forth, mostly me apologizing for being the horrible person I was and for what I did. She told me that the deception was too much for her to overcome and that she has to say goodbye to me. She told me to be well and to treat myself well and that was that. She blocked my number, which is easily known via having iPhones. I presume she never wants to hear from or speak to me again because of that.

Again, here we are.....21 days later....the karma of what I have done is catching up to me. I think about her all the time. I think about her smile, I think about her voice, her dog, her entire being. I fell completely in love with her and I didn't expect that to happen. We shared songs we like, we shared movies we liked, all of this....I can't listen to these songs, I can't see these movies, I'm of course, never ever going to do anything like this again. Before anyone asks, I completely deleted and removed the profile from OKC. I have learned a valuable lesson from this at the expense of my heart and probably hers also, if she is hurt I would do anything I could to make that go away.

Anyways that's my story. I'm completely heart broken and I can't stop thinking about her and that is my punishment for what I have done.",0,"the individual is not experiencing loneliness because they were actively engaging with another person on an emotional level even though it was under false pretenses. they developed a deep emotional connection and shared personal aspects of their lives with someone else. the heartbreak and emotional turmoil they describe are consequences of their actions and the loss of that connection, not indicative of an underlying state of loneliness."

People almost always stop conversation short. You can defend it- ""Well if the people are being weird or conversation isn't going anywhere or they don't get back to me in time, etc."" Well guess what guys, we are weird people, with no social skills, and anxiety.

"The key to overcoming lonelinessWhen do you feel most lonely? New Year's Eve alone or alone on a normal weekday work night?

I'm pretty sure everyone would say NYE, or another festival like Christmas. 

The difference is that being alone on a weekday night feels normal whereas being alone on NYE feels abnormal. Your entire inner emotion and perspective has shifted based on an external issue. When lots of people are feeling more lonely anyway even when around people. 

You're also choosing to be alone and that is not a bad thing. Anyone could go out and sit in a pub/bar make random awkward conversation. Join millions of clubs. You choose not to do it because often your own company is better. Is that actually a bad thing? Lots of important people preferred their own company.

The quicker and faster you shift towards this mindset the more you will feel fulfilled. The added bonus is it can make you more attractive to others but that is not the aim or necessary.",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful and introspective perspective on loneliness, suggesting that being alone by choice is not inherently negative. the author discusses the difference in feeling lonely during special occasions versus regular days and emphasizes the value of one's own company. the tone suggests a level of self-awareness and acceptance rather than loneliness, indicating they are not feeling lonely."

"How to like my own companyLately I've heard the same lie over and over ''You have me'' but no. I DO have friends, people in my life...but the gist of it is, that everyone is absent. For some reason people come telling me everything is fine, I shouldn't say I'm lonely because I can say I have people...who aren't there. I don't belong anywhere, I'm merely an empty vessel doing some tasks throughout the day. It doesn't matter at the end of the day if I was there or not.

I've tried, I've done my part. Messages, questions, suggestions, invitations. With people online I can just blame myself, I'm not good enough to hold a conversation or I'm too aware of how horrible I am, so everything dies thanks to me. But my problem isn't exactly like ''how do I find more people in my life?'' 

Anyway, I'm already well aware I'm not worth it. I'm way too boring, regular media is very limited to me thanks to sexualisation, I have many problems, I'm not interesting and I don't have anything worthy to talk about. 

So, how do I just give up for good? When does the pain fade and I get numb to being lonely? At what point do I start just feeling happy by myself...? How do I figure out what things to do?? Many questions and probably no answers, but thanks for reading anyway.

"Was anyone else super alone in high school? Does anyone want to talk about it?When I say super alone I mean...going a whole day without saying a word to anyone. going a whole week without saying a word to anyone. and if you did say something your voice croaked or didn't sound smooth because it was the first thing you said all day. I mean feeling like you were INVISIBLE, and I don't mean that in a casual way, i mean feeling deeply invisible. Like even something like overhearing other people's conversations...idk how to explain it but when you're always the one listening to the conversation and not being a part of the conversation, it starts feeling really awful and really sad. I sorta had friends at some points but no one who understood me, or no one I could trust, or I was just the backup option. I just felt like an outsider. I still feel like an outsider and that I don't belong anywhere and I know that's super cliche but it's true. 

idk why...being alone in highschool is such a miserable experience. because i don't feel that way when im in my room or even now in college when I'm still alone. im still trying to figure that out.

I'm making this post bc I realized that this is the most defining experience for me. (idk if that's weird or a bad thing, but that's just how it is). And I don't think I can 100% relate to anyone, or that anyone gets me, unless they know what this is like. And I haven't met or spoken with anyone who knows what that feels like. And I'm tired of trying to talk to make friends with people through discord of whatever who obviously don't understand my lived experience. 

ANYWAY I'm 19F. DM me if you really know what I'm talking about. Or just comment idk. We probably won't become friends and that's fine I just want to to hear from people who know what that's like.

"I dont remember a time i was happyI remember being 8 years old and walking into my moms room at night, and telling her i wanted to kill myself. Not only did mom and dads divorce upset me, but i had absolutely no friends, bullied and picked on a lot. Before the divorce i saw my father beaten half to death in front of me. If anybody remembers the scene from 8 mile where hes junped in a trailer park, it was kinda like that. In a trailer park, jumped by several dudes, and i wasnt but 6 feet away when it happened. Mom had already separated and moved somewhere else while i finished school there. He was laying in a pool of blood and i swore to god he was dead. But he wasnt, but he did become addicted to spice for 6 years, smoked it in front of me with his friends when i tried to visit. He was diagnosed with drug induced schizophrenia and epilepsy. He has delusions hes one of the four horsemen from the book of revelations. And has committed crimes according to that belief. Mom mentally abused me. I was often gas lighted and manipulated. We often got into huge fights (nothing physical ever)just words like r*t*rd or f*gg*t cuz im bisexual. I had tons of fights at school. I graduated from ""alternative school"" i was sent there for busting a dudes head open after he was messing with me. My fiance just cheated on me. Was with her for 4 years. I made her my entire world. Really only wanted to keep livong to be with her. Im 21 years old. But i just dont see a good reason to try anymore. Maybe im just a little bitch and other people have had it worse off. But to live for myself? Thats a concept i cant grasp. Im always told im nice, smart, funny and thats not me bragging. In fact, i dont believe it. Im no better than anyone else in this world. I make mistakes and im human. What would i have to offer anybody? Especially when the girl i thought i loved cheated on me, and all i ever did was be the man she wanted and needed. She really made me feel like i was special to her. Like i actually mattered to someone. But now i know i didn't matter enough. After all the gifts, the proposal, the memories.

I know isolating myself is not good for overall health but in all those relationships I feel so burden and not to mention Alone. Like all the time. 

All of those relationships were predicated on what I could do for them. Growing up I was ostracized by both parents so I??m used to it but as they got older and needed help they relied on me and not my siblings (who they showered with everything I never got). And I??m still resentful about it. With my friendships, I was basically a free therapist. I considered them my best friends but I could never talk about what I was going through. And when I did, within 2-5 responses the conversation would switch to them and I??d end up comforting them. I was in an abusive (not physical) relationship, and when I finally felt ready to talk with them about it?? crickets. 

Anyways, long story short, I just felt it was better to be actually alone than to maintain relationships that made me feel lonely. I??m not sure if I made the right call or if this come back to bite me in the ass.

But you just lied to me. Even talked about how you wanted this guy that you use to talk to before. Ya I know about all of that. So we ended. I don??t know how long it??s been but getting on Reddit recently I just wanted to see your smile. And I actually never thought I??d see you but I did today.

"My realityI'm still struggling to comprehend the fact that people actually have people that like them in real life. Like, not even strictly romantically, just in general. Its mind boggling really. Idk, its just bizarre to me. Affection exists, friendships exists, and so do relationships. But they seem so... out of touch for me. Like it's an unattainable thing. But obviously it's not 4 other people. It's like I'm viewing all these things through a lense, rather than actually being in it.I look at just notice weird things,  like how often others smile or laugh while in a moment or simply how someone may interact with another person. But I'm just observing it while they are living it. I'm just there.  Its quiet odd. I dunno. Its just unsettling tbh. Having no friends isn't ideal but like I said before, its impossible for me to genuinely believe that someone would actually want to be my friend. So its just never really been something I've pursued or put effort towards. It just doesnt seem realistic. It seems out of reach and just beyond me, to be completely honest. People genuinely have people who gaf about them, like them, and care about what you they to say. That's crazy. The more I think about it the more insane I get. Anyhow, just sharing my thoughts.  It's not anything serious, just getting less and less easier to pretend it doesn't bug me.",0,the person is expressing feelings of isolation and disbelief in the possibility of forming meaningful connections. they observe others engaging in friendships and relationships but feel these experiences are unattainable for them. they mention having no friends and doubting that anyone would want to be their friend. this indicates a sense of loneliness and disconnection from others.

I'm just an outsider. I don't have a real social circle. And the worst part is, I did this to myself. I can never decide if I want to be social or not. It sucks. For a while I want to be quiet and reserved, and then I want to have friends. But I can't because I'm not social all the time like regular people. It just doesn't work like that. I have to pick one or the other. But all I get now is just constant reminders that I'm a loser.

"""Shooting your shot"" is useless if you have no ammoIdk, this may sound juvenile at best but there's this girl in my class and I just think she's really pretty. Issue is that I figured I'd just leave it at that but my friends tried to push me to talk to her and I keep feeling as if everything I say is futile, as if it's ridiculous to assume she'd even want to be friends with me at any point because I'm not worth talking to at all.

Honestly don't know what the point of this was, maybe I just needed to vent, but just I can't bring myself to keep trying to befriend her because in the end I know I'll mess it up somehow.

A judgy solution filled overstepping statement about my mindset when he doesn??t know me enough to say such things. It??s so annoying. Is it me. Feel like I??m the one constantly pushing these people away sometimes but I also don??t feel like  I??m hard  to deal with. I??m not passive but I??m super easy to please and easy to help. I don??t take life too seriously anymore because I??m fucking insane so it takes a lot to bother me. I don??t even get annoyed the way others around me do but when I get annoyed I get very unlikeable. This same type of pattern happens everyday: all the time. I??m currently high and drunk, about to get drunker and self loathe for an hour or so until i pass out. And I??m gonna do it again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day.

"Midnight RantHey. Glad you joined me tonight and listen to what I have to say. Not that this might be of an importance to anyone but anyways...  
It is 4 am and I'm sitting on my Laptop in bed and wide awake. I feel like shit. Honestly terrible. On one hand because i twisted my ankle pretty bad just recently because I'm stupid. On the other hand is because I just installed TikTok earlier that day. And you might ask yourself whats so wrong about installing TikTok nowdays since nearly everyone uses it even though it can be a bit cringey sometimes. And you're absolutely right. There is nothing wrong with that itself. It's just... my for you page became a depression filled mess. It changed from the usual happy go lucky content you'd might expect from a platform like TikTok to a depressed and sad pile of bs. And in the middle there's me. I've been in bed and watching those sad and depressive ""motivational"" type of tik toks for the last couple of hours and feeling miserable. Part of me just wanted to die internally. The entire time I just wanted to cry. But i couldn't. No matter how hard I tried I just could not do it. Until I stumbled upon one video that hit me really hard and it felt so relatable because I was going through that exact situation they were describing in that video. And so I just started crying all of a sudden. And I really don't cry very often. It was the first time in 2 years I was able to cry like that. I kinda felt relieved afterwards.

Now its nearly 4:30 am and the weather outside is just going nuts. I am still sad. Why am I like this...

"How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you? (LONG POST)How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you?

I am trying so hard to redefine success - which at the core I truly believe is fulfillment/satisfaction/contentment/happiness/inner peace.

But it's hard when you come from a culture (I was born and raised in the United States but my family is of Asian descent) that highly praises and emphasizes honor, awards/accolades, academic success, big-named schools, prestige, power, popularity/fame, riches, status, meeting the stereotypical life milestones by a specific age, etc. I'm trying to break away from this mindset. I am very close with my family, but, I hate that we are part of a community that really is deeply enmeshed in this ideal if you know what I mean. Social events with other Asian folks (people my parents know and their kids who are in their late 20s/30s). I'm in my late 20s (for context), single, unemployed, and living with my parents. Graduated medical school in 2019 but have had to study for licensing exams in order to get a job in my field. These exams have given me a very difficult time. I've never been a good studier/test taker. Always been a mediocre student. I graduated at the bottom 10% of my class. I couldn't get involved in extracurriculars because I failed exams and was very overwhelmed with my rigorous program. Even repeated a year and graduated later than my friends (who are all working). Barely passed my first board and am studying to re-take another exam that I need for medical residency. It's been a difficult journey. This certainly is not how I envisioned my life post graduation. It's taking me so long to get my life together. I feel bad because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) throughout my entire journey and it's taking me so long to get my life together. I have heard them a couple times comparing me to other girls my age: ""Look! so and so is your age and almost done with medical residency and she's ready to start her fellowship. She's pregnant with her second child."" or, ""When are you going to hurry up? So and so already has interviews for residency programs.""

I want to be a child psychiatrist more than anything though. I'm just frustrated it's taking longer than I hoped. And besides being a practicing doctor, there is SO MUCH else I want to do in life (publish a book, get into flower design, start a podcast, candle-making, travel, etc.)

But I feel self-conscious and even inadequate about my station in life sometimes. While I do appreciate the time and freedom I have (because of the lack of responsibilities), at social gatherings, people ALWAYS ask what I'm up to. I feel inadequate compared to the other girls my age who are established doctors in training/lawyers/aspiring business magnates/politicians/diplomats/etc. who have gone to or are working for prestigious institutions/programs. Some even married and also with kids. While I have none of that at the moment. A few of the girls are honestly really mean to. They pry and ask about what I'm doing, when I'm applying to residency, what I've been doing since graduation, etc. and they lord it over me what they have - being far along in their medical training, being married, etc. In my interactions, I try not to let my upset feelings show on my face. I try and demonstrate grace congratulating them on their achievements, asking them what they like about work/their spouse/kids, etc. But I still feel bothered on the inside. I want to get to a point where I don't feel provoked by other people no matter what they do/say. I genuinely want to wish them well in their lives (even if they are jerks). Getting to that point is hard because sometimes I feel that it's not fair what they have (or that because they are shitty people that they have success in life). Really trying to get out of this frame of thinking because I'm not seeing the full picture. I know they're just projecting what they want me and other people to see. But I know genuinely wishing them well and being happy to see that they got what they wanted hits folks like this on another level. How do I stop feeling bothered?

I am very attached to my parents. This time I've had with them since I moved back home after finishing school has been precious. The other night I thought to myself: ""When am I ever going to have this amount of dedicated time with them ever again? I don't know if I ever will...life moves so fast...""

The only thing that's been helping me has been church and Bible time. I have started going recently and I feel...great every single time I go. I am reminded of the brevity of our lives. Whether a human being lives until 100 or 80 years...that is still short in light of eternity. And while I am aware of this sobering reality (and time with God has changed my perspective on what's truly important). This thought always crosses my mind when I hear news of a rich and famous person dying. They've accumulated everything and couldn't take anything with them.

It's just hard remembering this in the moment when I'm at these social functions. People are mean. They attach their worth to what you have/haven't accomplished. They attach your worth to your career/other external measures of success. I have started to realize that it's an individual's heart and character that carries them far, isn't it? It's really sad how the world doesn't see it that way.

I know we're in the middle of a pandemic (and the States has no intention of going under lockdown). I'm just afraid of going to social events. They make me anxious. I don't want to make an appearance because of where I am in life. I know it sounds terrible.

"We deserve better than thisHi, first time poster but an occasional lurker. I just wanted to say that we're a lot stronger than people give us credit for. Unfortunately there's this burden put on lonely people, a piece of ""advice"" people always put out there that always runs along the lines of outcasts and misfits being their own burden. 

If only we could all just change in the right way to be accepted, right? I call bullshit... Sure we all have aspects that make us less palpable, but who doesn't? Some of the most popular are also the most rude, selfish, insufferable people on earth (obviously not all, but the existence of people like this shows there's more than just ""bad behavior"" at play). Truth is, most of us are just different.

I'm personally done changing for other people. If I change I want it to be for ME, because I'm done being someone I'm NOT. And if you're reading this and you feel like your feet are at the edge of the world with not a soul around to care, just know you're worth fighting for. You're just like anyone else, with feelings, and hopes and dreams. If others deserve to be cared for, then we do too.

It's about someone very special to me, a person everytime i feeling scared or bad i always thinking about him and calling his name, i always imagining him here with me. He's like a safe place to me, a happiest place to me, he make me feel okay. He's the reason why i still looking for tomorrow, the reason i didn't lose hope yet, a reason for me to stay. He is my source of motivation, he keep me ""sane"".

He is everything i want in this world..

But there's a problem, He didn't know me.
He don't even know im exist. I want him to know me but i don't know how to reach him. Im too scared to send a message to him or even leave a comment on his social media, all i can do is ""like"" his post. I wish he could acknowledge me, acknowledge my existence but at the same time i also worried, ""He's not gonna like this, He will judge me, He's not gonna accept me"" for so many reason. There's so many ""wrong"" about me..

I really wish i could talk to him personally, I really want to talk to him. This is so wrong to say this but i need him. I want to be close with him, i want him to be here, i want him to know what i feel. There's a paper i slip on my comic book. On that paper i draw a star symbol with his name written on it. Everytime i feel scared and anxious i wrote a message on that paper. ""Can you hear me?"", ""I need you"" and then i blow the paper like i blow a candles and hope the wind or universe will send my message to him somehow, someway..

I'm so crazy and desperate but i need him. There's so many things I need to fix about me. It's make me feels overwhelming, I need a little help from him. I just need him to be ""here"" for me, that's will be much much bigger help for me, make my life much lighter. The only help i looking for and probably work for me is him. He is my only hope. He is the only thing i need. I like him, i really like him and I want to be with him. I really.. really wish universe make this happen. I make a vow for this..

Went back to mine and actually had some really really good passionate sex. Which I know was pretty silly but meh.

Woke up in the morning he stayed with me until around 1pm, we watched peep show (if you haven??t seen, you need too) we had a laugh, cuddled, had more sex, kissed and held hands. I dropped him off home and he kissed me good bye and said he would text me later on.

5 hours later no text, so I texted him and I never got a response. I added him on Facebook and tried on there incase he slipped up a digit in the number. He opened the message and never replied.

While I think giving comforting words like ""it will get better"" can be a good thing, does it really help to hear that in your situation? What if you're in a setting where you know it's not going to get better? Many of you are probably adults, or in areas where nothing will change randomly. Let's say you're living on your own, with little to no friends. How is life going to start looking up? Those words fall flat in moments like that, in my opinion.

What if you could find a friend or five? What about a boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you have one? Do you want one? What are you doing to work towards the goal of finding someone? Have you gone outside lately? Does it suck to get out of bed? How often do you speak to people in general?

Yet because I??m so dumb and unattractive I never got to even be seen as a romantic option by guys.

Sitting here listening to Juice Wrld in my feelings, also sippin'.  I'm just tired.  Everything is going so well right now, but just at night everything just hits me.

What's funny about all of this is I had a blast sober today going back and forth in a legal meeting we had over a business contract we're starting than I've had in... I can't tell you how many years.  I may be looking into law school/ becoming a paralegal because today really got my rocks off, and I don't mean sexually at all.  I think I may have finally found my calling after 27 years.  I thought it was medical, then chemist, then medical, then computers, now this.  I am a bit of a jack of all trades but today was way too fun.  Mentally exhausting but fun.  I actually impressed myself a lot going almost tit for tat w/ lawyer and having my boss kind of sit there just letting us make the decisions.

"Can't seem to have funI feel like I have always struggled to enjoy myself. I have now been in college for two months and haven't made any friends, but I don't seem to care enough to try. Every time I talk to my friends from high school I realize that I don't know how to have fun. I was just asked what fun things I did this weekend, and I said studying and going to review sessions, like I sounded excited about it. To be fair, that is more than I do on a typical weekend. I have always done well in school, but I feel like I invest too much of my time into it. At the same time, I keep doing it because I have nothing else to do that really brings me joy and want to at least be good at something. I have no hobbies, and every time I am doing something that is supposed to be fun, I either stress about it or feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. All I do is study, watch YouTube, and play the occasional game. I guess I feel satisfied most of the time, but I feel kind of empty, like I have no personality. I can never come up with a fun fact about myself, and I feel like I'm the most generic person out there. My roommate, who is a friend from high school, is the exact opposite of me. He made a friend group within a few days and seems to have so much fun all the time. I hate the fact that I am like this but I seem to be mad that he is having so much fun while I'm just doing nothing. I don't think I'm sad but I feel like I really enjoy something only once in a while just to wait for weeks or months before feeling the same happiness again.",0,"the narrative indicates feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction with social interactions and personal enjoyment. the person struggles to find joy in activities and feels disconnected from peers, which suggests underlying loneliness. the comparison with the roommate and the lack of meaningful hobbies further emphasize this."
"Worst week of the year, every yearI just wanted to start off by saying that I'm sorry if you came along to this post. I usually do my best to not share these feelings, because of how inconvenient it is to people that I've encountered in my life that I stopped trying. I just feel like for someone who shares the same week of birth as Valentine's Day, it's very rough to be alone in the world. 

My family had all of our birthdays pretty close together, mine is in Feb. My sister in March, and my mother in April, and my father in October (he's the only exception). Mine being the same week as valentine's, I always saw my parents spending all the time and money in the world getting each other gifts for valentine's that when they remembered my birthday, if they did. There would be no time for me or they'd not have anything for me. My sister mainly goes guy to guy so she's always been out socializing. Anyways, I'm not going to go on and on, but I just felt that since my family wasn't really ever around plus having no friends. I find it super depressing to share the same week of birth as valentine's, especially this year. I can only imagine what it feels like to share the same day as Valentine's. 

The worst part about it all, is that whenever I brought it up to my family, friend etc. They always made it out to me that I was being selfish. It makes me feel shitty that I, no matter what I did to win approval or merits, that I was always forgotten. Especially on the week of Valentine's, sometimes it makes me wish that I wasn't around so that I wouldn't be so much of a god**** burden. I just want to feel loved and appreciated like everyone else does. Is that too selfish?

Anyways, thank you if you made it this far. I appreciate it if you read it this far. I hope you all feel better and can be happy eventually too, if you aren't happier already.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of isolation and neglect, particularly around birthdays and valentine's day, suggesting a lack of meaningful connections with family and friends. the person feels forgotten and unappreciated, indicating significant loneliness."
Why?[deleted],0,the narrative is extremely brief and does not provide any details about the person's social or emotional state therefore there is no evidence to suggest loneliness
"It hurts thinking of her after these couple of yearsBefore I left for Boot Camp, I was seeing this girl. We were together for half a year up to that point. We had a pretty stable, functional relationship. I finished Boot Camp and I was surprised to find out that she had lost feelings for me. I know it??s to be expected especially at a young age. Just thought stuff would be different...",0,"the person reflects on a past relationship and acknowledges the natural progression of feelings changing over time. they do not express a pervasive sense of loneliness but rather a specific disappointment about this particular relationship ending. they also seem to understand and accept the situation as a normal part of life, indicating they are not overwhelmed by loneliness."
"Most people today:""Dude I got laid with my girlfriend last week and it was SOOO GOOODDD THE BEST THING EVER bro I really love her everything is so awesome that is the meaning of life. Sadly I can't see her because of the quarantine when it's all over I'll go and have sex with her again for days consecutively. Omg do you even know what not having sex for a week feels like? IT'S HELLL!!!!!""

The exact same people when you mention you've never had a girlfriend:

""Don't worry bro, you don't need anyone to be happy bro, love yourself bro, sex is so overrated bro, just because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't mean you have to do so too bro, your time will come bro, you don't lose anything bro, relationships are not the meaning of life bro.""",0,the person is not lonely because they are expressing frustration and sarcasm about societal attitudes towards relationships and sex rather than indicating personal feelings of loneliness or isolation they seem to be critiquing the inconsistency in how people talk about relationships rather than expressing a deep personal need for connection
"I wish that I could forget the painI wish i could just forget that entire year, sure there was some good times and memories but it just all reminds me of what happened. I still can??t believe it even happened i??m honestly shocked i feel like it??s a nightmare i haven??t woken up from.   I wanna forget it so that i can stop thinking up it every day, so it can stop keeping me up on nights like these. I wouldn??t even curse my worst enemy with this punishment. Can??t think of anything worse that could have happened and of course it happened it me. One part of me wants to believe i was in the wrong place at the wrong time the other wants to believe this was meant to happen.",0,the person is expressing deep pain and regret about a past event but does not indicate feelings of loneliness. they are focused on their trauma and desire to forget it rather than on a lack of social connection or companionship.
"Tired of being tired of being aloneWhat I??d do for an evening hanging out with someone, talking about anything, talking shite. Just to have that chilled out comfort knowing the person you??re hanging out with is equally comfortable. God I miss that feeling. 10+yrs ago I??d laugh at the thought of such a ??want?? but jeez I want that, I need that, I miss that!",0,the person is expressing a deep longing for companionship and reminiscing about past times when they felt connected with others. they mention feeling tired of being alone and missing the comfort of hanging out with someone. this suggests a significant sense of loneliness.
"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Anyone else?Feeling different now. Short and simple. No detail,0,"the narrative is very brief and lacks detail, making it difficult to infer much about the person's emotional state. the absence of specific content about feelings of loneliness, isolation, or a lack of social connections suggests that the person is not necessarily lonely. the focus seems to be on a change in feeling, but without context, it does not indicate loneliness."

Why do I keep falling for girls I can??t have?I??m 21 and I rarely connect with girls but any girls I do talk to for an extended period of time I fall for easily. I wasted 8 years of my life on one girl I never had a chance with and now I??ve fallen for another girl who I don??t have a shot with. I don??t think I??ll ever be able to date because every girl I fall for just rejects me. It seems like dating is so easy for all my friends and my siblings but for me it??s harder than rocket science and all I want is connection with a girl but it??ll never come,0,"the narrative reflects a person who is struggling with romantic relationships and feeling rejected, but they mention having friends and siblings, indicating social connections and support systems. thus, they are not entirely isolated or devoid of companionship."
"Musicians, let??s chatnan",0,the narrative is a brief and casual invitation for musicians to chat. it suggests the person is seeking interaction but does not provide enough context to conclude that they are lonely. it could simply be an interest in connecting with others who share a similar passion.
I'm just a bit lost.I've been in a new city for just over a year and I'm so disconnected from home. A fresh start now feels a bit like a total loss. I have some people here but it's not at all the same. Work here is what I wanted but now I'm not sure what to do. Someone to talk to would be nice. Really just writing this out is helpful in it's way. ,0,"the person is experiencing feelings of disconnection and uncertainty due to being in a new city but mentions having some people around and finds writing helpful. this indicates they have some social connections and coping mechanisms in place, suggesting they are not entirely isolated or lonely"

"Should I go back to Facebook?The reasons for quitting social media are plentiful, but I sometimes lament that I have nowhere to share my worthy thoughts or memorable moments. I quit Facebook because it contributes to isolation by creating a false sense of connection. But I haven??t succeeded at becoming any less lonely. If I went back, I could only begin rebuilding with a very short friend list. Is it worth it? Would it be less lonely?",0,"the person expresses feelings of loneliness and acknowledges that quitting social media has not made them less lonely. they are contemplating returning to facebook to mitigate these feelings, suggesting a desire for connection and interaction. thus, the reasoning indicates a state of loneliness."
My biggest problem in life...So I find I just can't connect with girls. I just want love and I want to give it so badly.

"Lotta friendsbut not a lot of phone calls or text messages.

Waking up to 0 notifications every day gets depressing, lonely, and fucking tiring. 

It sucks when you know so many people, got a lot of contact numbers, and they won't even text or call you to see how you've been holding up. 

I'm reaching out to people, seeing how they're doing, but nothing in return. Days, even weeks go by without a single reply. 

To see happy people chatting away with their friends and family on zoom calls and text messages.....the loneliness just increases more and it turns into jealousy and bitterness.

I don't want to think that because it's so damn stupid to hate on happy people, but...I just wish I had that too. 

Honest friends to talk to all day, all night instead of the same repeated cycle; wake up, eat, nap, YouTube (clean up a bit too). 

Online is nice and all, but sometimes it's sad.

"With how many times I get ghosted on reddit, it mindswell be a digital cemeteryThey should rename all the ""Make Friends Here"" sub reddits to ""Make Spiritual Ghost Friends Here"" since so many people ghost each other. I'm just sick and tired of being treated like a disposable piece of trash that anyone can throw away whenever I'm not convenient for them anymore. I'm a human being with feelings and emotions and wants/needs aswell, it'd be nice to be treated like one.

I get ghosted so much, I'm genuinely starting to wonder if it's just me but on the other hand I realize that anyone who ghosts me is the loser cause in the end they lost someone special and I dodged a bullet.

I thought another guy liked me when I was 18, we were hanging out and getting close, I found he was also trying to message my friend. Met another guy on an app, he told me I'm cool but he still wants to date other people. As if I'm going to sit there and be a placeholder until he finds someone better. No matter what I do I am never good enough to earn that girlfriend position, just good enough to be a placeholder. I usually just settle for it or else I have nothing. I just want to be shown off and the girlfriend for once. But I'm not good enough for that so it is what it is I guess.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of being undervalued and overlooked in relationships, indicating a pattern of rejection and a desire for genuine connection. the individual feels like a placeholder and settles for less to avoid having nothing, which suggests underlying loneliness."
