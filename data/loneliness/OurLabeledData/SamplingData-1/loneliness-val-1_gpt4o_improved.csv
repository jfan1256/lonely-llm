Why is it that everyone??s sharing sage lvl knowledge, on every platform there is, but I still can??t get over people that walk in and out of my life? 

I know I??m young. I know how much I??ve grown from what I was to become what I am now. I know what else I need to achieve to live my dreams in my future reality. And I know I shouldn??t compare my growth to others.. I know.

Ig it all started when I moved to another city. Lost all my friends and had to make new ones. Not a big deal right? Well the 2 years I lived there I couldn't make one single friend, ig I was too ""different"". That's what I've been telling myself for a long time. We moved again, I had high hopes this time. But no change haha. Everything just got worse. 
Yk I always tought I was the weird one, but at that time it felt like everyone else was weird. I was nice, pretty funny, a good listener, I tought of myself as the perfect friend. I put so much effort into making friends. I was always gave my all to someone but they never gave something back. I mean that's what relationships are about right? Giving and taking. You cant just give and give without receiving. Itll make you feel worn out after a while. Ig that happened to me. After a while I just stopped trying. And now everyone is leaving cuz I ""changed"". Well they've already left haha. I've been alone for 2 years now. Well not ""alone"". I have my mom and sister who care alot about me. But it sucks seeing other kids my age having fun with eachother while I'm sitting at home every day doing nothin but laying in my bed. Maybe I'll make a friend some day, maybe it's just not my time yet yk. All I want is one good friend, is that possible? If you read this all thank you, I appreciate it. Why you may ask?

"I hate being lonely but I accept it either wayI know my friends aren't always Available but I don't know it just feels like they don't want to talk to me. I guess it is annoying being texted ""how was your day"" everyday but I just want to know how they are because I want them to feel cared for even though I'm always the one to text first. I just wish I was they're first option I do hang out with them at school everyday before quarantine and it was just the 3 of us but now. The longer this quarantine is the dryer the conversation is, it's like it doesn't really matter whether I text or not but once I don't text for a week all of a sudden they are worried. So I text back saying I couldn't find my charger or something.

I wish I could tell them how bad me day was, or why I was crying, or why I don't respond to their text for a few weeks because I didn't want to bother them. I hate when people worry about me because anything they say or do to help never works but I appreciate it. I occasionally harm my self but I'm ashamed of what they will think. What happens to me isn't in their control and I don't want them to feel like they can't help me because they don't understand the situation. So I try my best to put a smile on my face, and to put a smile on them too.

I obviously didn??t have the same chemistry with these new friends and I was too scared to talk.

"I feel lonely and worthlessSo about a month ago, my now ex broke up with me. After a few days of chatting, we decided to give it another try. Today she broke up with me again because I had a migraine and had to cancel our plans.

I don't think we can be fixed from this point onward. I just feel completely worthless as a person because of my migraines, because I have been cast aside because of them. I just feel so lonely and looking at endless months of lockdown with no more contact with somebody I have been so close to and not really having anyone else to talk to is terrifying me. I just feel hopeless and lost at the moment.

I want a hug. I want to know I will feel ok again.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of loneliness and worthlessness stemming from a recent breakup. the writer mentions feeling abandoned and isolated due to their migraines, which have led to the dissolution of their relationship. the repetitive use of words like ""lonely,"" ""worthless,"" ""hopeless,"" and ""lost"" indicates a significant emotional struggle. the mention of the lockdown exacerbates these feelings, highlighting the lack of social contact and support. the desire for physical comfort, such as wanting a hug, underscores the need for human connection and reassurance. these elements collectively reflect typical indicators of loneliness, such as social isolation, emotional distress, and a yearning for connection."
"I feel like no one appreciates meA month ago I helped a 50 yo lady with her luggage onto a train and she called me charming. I think that is the only genuine compliment I have gotten all year. I feel like nobody thinks of me. I hate having to invite myself to social events but I feel like when I don??t, I won??t even leave my room. I don??t even know why I post this but I have nobody to vent to.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a yearning for social validation. the individual mentions a lack of appreciation and the scarcity of genuine compliments, which underscores feelings of being unnoticed and undervalued. the act of helping someone and receiving a compliment stands out as a rare positive interaction, highlighting how infrequent such moments are in their life. the discomfort with self-inviting to social events suggests a struggle with social connections and a fear of rejection or being a burden. the mention of staying in their room if they don't make an effort to engage socially indicates a tendency towards isolation. finally, the act of posting about their feelings due to having no one to vent to is a clear sign of loneliness, as it shows a lack of supportive relationships where they can share their thoughts and emotions. these elements combined are typical indicators of loneliness, demonstrating a profound need for social interaction and emotional support."
"Lonely and hurtLife has been hard for me the past year, especially now in 2021. I??ve never had a great social life IRL, and lost all my school friends as I stopped playing with them and sold my ps4 years ago. I had online friends after that.

As 2021 started, my online friends started to fade. I went through my first break up in 2020 that scarred me deeply, then later on, as said my online friends started leaving and stopped talking to me.

My first online friend, whom was my best friend, left just as summer started. That was that. My best friend, gone forever, and its all cause of how bad my mental health became.

I now remain with one online friend who I regularly talk to, but I??m about to lose them as well. Every day, I lose my grip on our friendship more.
This is all I have left. Without them, I have no one close anymore.

Worst thing of all, im young. Too young to feel this immense misery and pain. I wish I??d never walk this path in life, and that things would be better. I need someone to talk to now. A friend, someone to get comfortable with. I miss having someone by my side to hear me out. I was careless to not show appreciation before, but I??m changed now.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and emotional pain. the author recounts a series of losses, including the end of friendships and a significant breakup, which have compounded their feelings of loneliness. they express a longing for companionship and regret over past actions that may have contributed to their current state. the repeated mention of losing friends, both in real life and online, highlights a persistent theme of social disconnection. the narrative also reveals a deep-seated desire for meaningful human interaction and support, underscoring the author's struggle with loneliness. the emotional weight of their words, coupled with their reflection on missed opportunities to nurture relationships, further illustrates the depth of their solitude and need for connection."
"[28M] Introvert who wants to meet a nice girl   I've been feeling extremely lonely as of late and I just really want someone to talk to. I usually hang out with my friends on PS4 but lately we haven't have any games we're interested in playing together and my closest friend is falling on hard times so we haven't been able to hang out lately. I've never really had a girlfriend and it's never really bothered me until recently when I felt the loneliness hit me like truck. I'm not looking for anything sexual because I personally don't believe in premarital sex and I don't mind if we're too far apart for IRL interaction, I'd just like to play games with someone and talk about each other's interests.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and longing for companionship. the individual explicitly mentions feeling ""extremely lonely"" and expresses a desire for someone to talk to, indicating a clear emotional need for connection. their usual social interactions through gaming with friends have diminished due to a lack of mutual interest in games and a friend's personal struggles, further contributing to their sense of loneliness. the mention of never having had a girlfriend and the recent impact of loneliness suggests a growing awareness and discomfort with their solitary state. their wish for non-sexual companionship and willingness to engage in long-distance interactions highlights a yearning for emotional intimacy and shared interests, which are common indicators of loneliness. the overall tone and specific examples from the narrative underscore the individual's struggle with feeling disconnected and their earnest desire for meaningful social interaction."
"Nobody asks how I amNobody ever seems to do stuff showing they care about me. No hugs, no affection, nothing besides laughing at the jokes that I say a lot. Despite much of my humor being driven by self-Anger and thus being aimed at myself most of the time, nobody seems to pick up on the fact that I want affection and to feel cared for, and instead they just laugh along. It's been so long since anyone has asked how I was without me explicitly saying that I don't feel well, and it just seems like I push people away by being myself",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of emotional neglect and a lack of meaningful social connections, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a feeling of being unseen and uncared for, as evidenced by their observation that nobody asks how they are or shows affection towards them. the use of humor as a coping mechanism, particularly humor that is self-deprecating, suggests an attempt to mask their inner turmoil and a hope that others might notice their distress. however, the fact that people only laugh at their jokes without recognizing the underlying plea for attention and care exacerbates their feelings of isolation. the narrative also reflects a sense of self-blame, as the person believes that being themselves pushes others away, further deepening their loneliness. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness, characterized by a lack of emotional support and a sense of disconnection from others."
"Anyone else feel like thisMy wife left me here and now I??m all alone in our empty house and it feels like she took all of my dreams and hope and faith with her.

"New here - Old everywhereI don't really know where to start. I've been everywhere and never fit anywhere. From coast to coast in North America I've never done anything right to fit in. I'm loud and certainly annoying. I don't really try to make people like me, I just act like myself and generally fit in at first. it takes about three to four days solid with me and no one likes me. I've got some head issues I'm very open about that people still don't seem to understand. I'm in love. Again. But someone different that's better than the rest like everyone else that's better than someone different. I don't even believe in that shit. I just don't want to be alone and I manifest it. At least that's what I think I do. It doesn't change the fact that I feel it regardless of whether I believe in it or not. Which is probably what makes it so painful when it all comes crashing down like it is currently. Again. I don't like any of my friends. They don't like me either. I've learned that everyone I know that acts like they like me really just thinks that I'll fuck them eventually because I'm pretty pathetic and not the most horrible thing to look at. It's been a hard realization but couldn't have come at a more perfect time since I can't hang out with anyone anyway with C19 going around. I don't really know what I'm going to do now. I don't want to integrate back into society and I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be in love with a guy that I know doesn't love me but I can't stop daydreaming about having someone. I don't think anyone wants to be alone and a lot of us probably don't know what it's like to have anybody anyway. I just don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to be alone and it sucks because everyone always tells me how great I am before they spent much time with me. So how do I be great all the time? And not get old to someone immediately? How do I be myself and not too much at the same time? It's one of those I want to blame everyone else but I know it's me things. And I don't know how to change who I actually am. And I know that everyone says you should be yourself and people will love you for that but can't love you if you're not, but people can't love me for what I am. Not for long anyway. And I really just can't fathom living forever this way. Like maybe I should start making friends online and not real life? Maybe distance between me and others would make it easier to accept me? It's the human touch thing that I'm afraid to lose. The hope thing has been gone a long time. The needy thing will probably last forever.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of disconnection and persistent feelings of inadequacy. the author describes a pattern of not fitting in, moving from place to place without forming lasting connections. they express a belief that their true self is inherently unlikable, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the mention of ""head issues"" and the frustration with others not understanding them further highlights their isolation. the desire to be loved and the pain of unreciprocated feelings are central themes, underscoring their yearning for meaningful relationships. the narrative also reflects a cycle of hope and disappointment, where initial acceptance by others quickly turns into rejection. the impact of the pandemic exacerbates their isolation, making it harder to maintain any social ties. overall, the narrative captures the essence of loneliness through the author's struggle to connect, feelings of being misunderstood, and the deep-seated fear of perpetual solitude."
"Bored and Lonely:(So I recently (about a year ago) I moved to a new country. Since I had loads of friends where I was before. I expected to atleast make a couple here. But due to my extreme awkwardness and shyness, I haven't made a single one. Yup, not even one. Just as I was beginning to connect with a couple people, school shut down. I've now gone over 4 months without having a proper conversation with anybody(excluding texts and a couple zoom calls from old friends.) 

Now that everything is opening up, I feel super alone, with nobody to meet but no excuse to stay in all the time. I feel like I'm living the same day over and over, lonely and bored. There isn't much to this post, except a stupid rant. But hey, maybe someone can relate.....",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions moving to a new country and struggling to make new friends due to extreme awkwardness and shyness, which highlights social anxiety and difficulty in forming new relationships. the shutdown of the school further exacerbates their isolation, as it cut off budding connections and left them without meaningful social interactions for over four months. the reliance on texts and zoom calls with old friends indicates an attempt to maintain some social contact, but it does not fulfill their need for in-person connections. the repetitive nature of their days and the expression of feeling super alone emphasize the monotony and emotional void they are experiencing. the narrative ends with a plea for relatability, suggesting a longing for understanding and connection from others. these elements collectively underscore the profound loneliness felt by the individual."
"Just another person in a sea of loneliness.24M With Asperger??s and I have been dealt a very shitty hand in life. Most of the time I have been rejected by groups, so I have learned to just keep to myself a lot. I was at a social event today and everyone was boasting about how they are in xyz group. Meanwhile I??m just out here barely making it by. 

I have a core group of irl friends but due to some recent events which made me the reoccurring character in my own life story, i was left out of events. This is very ironic and sad as the whole basis of that core group of friends being built was because we were all outcasts. Needless to say I have cut many of them out of my life. 

There are like a hand full of people internet friends I keep in touch with but that is just about it. I never get the help from my psychologist as she just says to do the same thing despite me doing everything and returning empty handed. 

I tried my luck in a different denomination of Christianity hoping for more and while I got more out of it, the backlash from my family was just too much to handle so for now, I have returned to my birth religion. It sucks as I actually liked the new denomination I joined and I could never find wrong doing with it. I just feel like I should have never questioned things to begin with and I wouldn??t have the problems I am having with religion as it hurts to leave the new denomination that I converted to and still subconsciously practice the denomination despite never being born into it but I had recent ancestors who were apart of it.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and rejection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual describes feeling like an outcast, both in social groups and within their core group of friends, which exacerbates their sense of being alone. the mention of having asperger's and feeling like they've been dealt a ""shitty hand"" in life further highlights their struggles with social integration and acceptance. despite having a core group of friends, recent events have led to their exclusion, which is particularly painful given that this group was originally formed by outcasts like themselves. the reliance on a few internet friends suggests a limited social network, and the lack of effective support from their psychologist adds to their feelings of isolation. their experience with changing religious denominations and the subsequent backlash from their family also contributes to their sense of not belonging anywhere. these elements combined paint a picture of someone who feels disconnected and unsupported, both socially and emotionally."
"Guess it's too lateI'm in my mid-20s. Never been in a relationship before. Never even been complimented tbh. The older I get, and the more time that passes without my life improving in any meaningful way, the less likely it is that it will ever get better. I'll get even uglier as I age, and being in my 30s or 40s with no experience will drive most people away anyway.

I wish I could make my desire for affection disappear. It will never be fulfilled, so it only serves to make me miserable.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and despair, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness about their romantic prospects, noting a lack of past relationships and even basic positive social interactions like compliments. their belief that time is running out and that aging will further diminish their chances of forming meaningful connections underscores a pervasive sense of futility. this is compounded by their desire to suppress their need for affection, which they perceive as unattainable and a source of ongoing misery. these elements collectively highlight a profound experience of loneliness, marked by negative self-perception and a bleak outlook on future social and emotional fulfillment."
"I am aloneMy girlfriend broke up with me after 6 months of relationship. It was a little while ago, but I still cry every night. 
 I don't go out for a week and no one asks what's going on or how I'm doing. Also, I had seen that my ex hangs out with another boy",1,"the narrative reflects classic signs of loneliness through several indicators. the individual explicitly mentions feeling alone and experiencing emotional distress following a breakup, which is a common trigger for loneliness. crying every night suggests a persistent sense of sadness and emotional pain. the lack of social interaction is evident from the statement about not going out for a week and the absence of concern from others, highlighting a sense of social isolation. additionally, the mention of seeing the ex with another person could exacerbate feelings of loneliness by reinforcing a sense of rejection and loss. these elements collectively point to a state of loneliness."
What do I do?Is it bad if I have no one in my life to talk to? What do I do?,1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of distress and confusion about the absence of social connections, which is a significant indicator of loneliness. the repeated questioning of ""what do i do?"" highlights a feeling of helplessness and uncertainty about how to cope with the situation. the specific concern about having ""no one in my life to talk to"" underscores a profound sense of isolation and lack of social support, which are core elements of loneliness. the brevity and directness of the narrative suggest an urgent need for connection and guidance, further reinforcing the emotional state of loneliness. these elements combined indicate a deep-seated feeling of being alone and unsupported."
I??ve accepted the fact I will die aloneSimply put I don??t think I??m cut out for dating I can??t initiate real face to face human interaction because I??m afraid of rejection and I stay hoping someone will just randomly come into my life at some point but I know for a fact that will never happen I don??t wtf to do I feel like I??m a nuisance to people I try and approach and it??s destroyed my confidence,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and hopelessness, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a belief that they will die alone and feels incapable of engaging in meaningful relationships due to a fear of rejection. this fear has led to an avoidance of face-to-face interactions, further reinforcing their isolation. the hope that someone will randomly enter their life, coupled with the certainty that it will never happen, highlights a sense of helplessness and resignation. the author also mentions feeling like a nuisance to others, which suggests a lack of self-worth and confidence. these feelings of inadequacy and the destruction of their confidence are classic symptoms of loneliness, as they contribute to the cycle of withdrawal and social disconnection."
"Any non-destructive ways to cope with loneliness?I don??t want to go too in depth unless anyone wants to know. 


I feel like no one is attracted to me. I haven??t kissed anyone at all and all I see around me are people in relationships. I??m not too hopeful about my future either. Honestly, I think I??m going to be alone for the rest of my life. I haven??t had anyone as a girlfriend thus far and that??s probably foreshadowing things to come. If I don??t have a girlfriend now, if no one is attracted to me now, that seems like a sign that I??m going to be alone forever, if we??re following patterns.

I can??t deal with this at all.  I can??t cope with this. The only way out right now seems to be self harm, just to release all the pain. It feels like a bug inside of me and I just need to take it out. 

OPTIONAL: I??m listening to music at the moment, which helps but it??s not enough. Not just sad/lonely stuff, there??s been some funny music in there as well. Still, if anyone wants to recommend any music ALONGSIDE their answer, I??m open. I??m into anything. Rock, Rap/Hip-Hop, Blues, Folk/Indie Folk, R&amp;B, even novelty??whatever.",1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly asks for non-destructive ways to cope with loneliness, which immediately suggests a struggle with feelings of isolation. the sense of social comparison is evident when the author mentions seeing people in relationships and feeling unattractive and unkissed, which exacerbates their loneliness. the author’s lack of hope for the future and the belief that they will be alone for the rest of their life further reinforce their sense of isolation and despair. the mention of self-harm as a coping mechanism is a significant red flag, indicating severe emotional distress often associated with intense loneliness. the fleeting relief provided by music, even though it includes upbeat and funny songs, underscores the persistent nature of their loneliness. these elements collectively paint a vivid picture of someone grappling with profound loneliness and the psychological pain that accompanies it."
"After years of being lonely, I realized... That I am a narcissistic, pathological liar.I lie about everything to everyone.

Sometimes to manipulate people to stay with me, other times to protect myself from getting hurt. I also lie about having a social life, an ex girlfriend who still loves (she doesn't even exist hence an ex) me, about being happy and content even though I am not, about my academics, about my likes and dislikes, about many things...

I feel empty, alone, disgusting and want it all to end sometimes, but I keep going for the people whom I love and cherish. I am trying to change my behavior, for the better, but on some days, it is still another day, another lie.",1,"the narrative reflects deep emotional turmoil and a profound sense of isolation. the individual admits to being a narcissistic, pathological liar, which suggests a complex defense mechanism to cope with feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. lying about having a social life, an ex-girlfriend, happiness, and contentment indicates a desire to present a facade of normalcy and fulfillment to others, masking their true feelings of emptiness and despair. the acknowledgment of feeling empty, alone, and sometimes wanting it all to end further underscores the depth of their loneliness. despite these feelings, the individual expresses a desire to change for the better and to continue living for the sake of loved ones, highlighting an inner conflict and a glimmer of hope amidst their struggles. these aspects are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a disconnection from genuine social bonds and a pervasive sense of isolation."
"Just some thoughtsDuring the pandemic I fell out of touch with a lot of people and now that we??re able to see each other I don??t have much in common with people because of how much they changed during the pandemic, they??re so different than what I remember and I feel so alone. I??ve been doing my own routine, day in day out the same thing and I feel stuck. I feel like I don??t want this to be my life but nobody reaches out to me, or if they do it??s very short lived and the plans more often than not fall through. I don??t feel like people I consider my friends make time for me, I see them hanging out with other people and while that doesn??t bother me specifically I wish they made the time to hang out with me too. I??m worried that I??m too overbearing and that people just simply don??t like hanging out with me for things about my personality that I??m not noticing. I just can??t handle the loneliness anymore.

"I??m tired.They tell me that I have to just wait for the right girl and that it??ll happen.

They tell me to love myself and be confident.

I kept telling myself that it would happen. I??d just need to wait.

Honestly it was Prom Night when I began to realize that I??m just a pathetic loser who will never amount to anything in this world. 

I stood there in an auditorium full of people I barely knew. Surrounded by ??friends?? who would later not even help me through the worst time in my life having to watch my grandmas health decline because of the ruthless brain cancer that took her away from me.

Instead they blamed me for my depression. Telling me that I choose not to be happy on purpose. That it wasn??t their responsibility to ??send their regards and condolences?? to me when she died, let alone even come to the funeral.

They cast me out. Hoping I would off myself probably. Telling me I was mentally insane and that I needed to ??do better??

Now before I moved I had no problem making friends / girlfriends I could do it with my eyes closed but due to my situation and some wrong doings I dropped all the people I know I have zero friends I disappeared to them. Well of course after some time it becomes lonely and or sexually frustrating or just even having a normal conversation would be nice.                                  

But I have a huge picture problem I never liked taking pictures I never have I??ve never liked how I looked in them and it??s not because I??m ugly I find myself fairly attractive actually but I??m not full of myself I??m no model.

"Got a job and now I am lonelyPost covid scenario in India. I \[M21\] am from a fairly middle class background. My parents are understanding and don't force me to do anything.

The sad thing is, when I do have a chance to talk to someone new, I (and the other person, so it seems) both often seem to be at a loss for words.  I really can't do the small talk that seems to dominate conversations between strangers or acquaintances.  For instance, I don't do the ""how are you"" unless I'm actually asking how the person is -- some people are just using it as a greeting, and a scripted ""fine thanks, you?"" is supposed to be the only response.  I can't do that.

"I'm attracted to emotionally and mentally unstable or disturbed lonely people like myself.Not just lonely in a social context but in their minds. Like that feeling that you're the only one who feels the way that you do because the people around you can't relate or talk about the things that effect you. Like they just don't have the capacity at times. (I know I sound like an asshole)

I'm attracted to these people because I feel like like other people haven't been through what I have and don't understand and won't take care of my fragility and loneliness. I'm sacred they'll think I'm weak and insecure. Where as a person who's been through emotional trauma will understand these things because we've been through similar experiences.

The funny thing is I'm scared to approach and talk deeply to people so I never get to find out who the emotionally and mentally unstable or ill (not in a psychotic way) are . So I never meet those people and therefore everyone comes off as being highly confident and we'll put together and it's like I'm this one cowering being in the middle of these people .

"romantically lonely / desperate bc covid-19, no idea what to doSo, I was thinking a lot today about confidence. One quote I read was, see yourself the way someone who admires you sees you. But then I thought about it and realized?? None of my friends really look up to me. I??m behind everyone career-wise, and my life is kind of a mess ?? between family tensions, shit mental health, and impulsive/reckless habits. I think they all look down on me or at best, feel sorry for me. The truth is I honestly wonder if I see myself better than I think they see me. Even when they??re being nice, I can??t help but wonder if they really judge me. So, I haven??t really been that invested in keeping up with them. It feels really exhausting to reach out. 

But... I??ve gotten really lonely. Lonely to the point where I??m suddenly really invested in internet friends. Not like Tinder, I really don't like dating sites -- but people from video game servers. I??m judging myself for it, totally. I??ve never been one to be considered romantically ??desperate?? but here I am in the early hours of the morning wanting to start a conversation with one of the thirsty boys I play video games with who called me hot just because I have a female avatar. I guess I??d just rather talk to people who don??t already know me. But I feel really sad, sitting here waiting on strangers to talk to me. I just want to feel some closeness to someone who really likes me, and compliments me romantically, I just want to lay next to someone at night.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and longing for connection. the individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and a lack of confidence, highlighted by their perception that friends look down on them or pity them. this sense of being behind in life, combined with family tensions and poor mental health, exacerbates their isolation. the exhaustion from trying to maintain friendships and the subsequent turn to internet friends for solace are clear indicators of their desperate need for companionship. the narrative also reveals a desire for romantic validation, as seen in their willingness to engage with strangers online for emotional and romantic attention. the sadness and self-judgment they feel about these interactions further underscore their loneliness and the yearning for genuine closeness and affection."

People come to me for their problems, but never listen to what I have to say. Every time I talk I get cut off, people ask me how I am then immediately go into what they??re going through and only talk about themselves. Remember even if you have a group of people that are your ??friends?? doesn??t mean that you have supports. Sometimes people don??t resonate on the same level as you or care about what you??re going through. All there is is emptiness and no substance in relationships you have with people.

"Nothing to ShowI have nothing to show for my life so far. Well, next to nothing. Nothing that matters to me. I feel like I don??t exist anymore, and the want(need?) for attention makes me feel like an attention whore child that needs other people to get along in life. I hate going to class and not existing. I have moved around my entire life, and while I have a few good friends, they have either moved away, I have moved away, or I have had fallouts with them, which is my current situation. 

I feel sick to myself when I feel a huge dopamine rush when someone asks me to do something for them, like picking up their pencil or letting them borrow a phone charger, I immediately feel bad after I realize that conversation will most likely never go past the few words that someone directs towards me asking for something.

I hate being a little bitch. I don??t want to admit that I feel upset or depressed, but it??s so hard to shake the feeling when I get home from a long day at school, where I accomplished nothing, because I am bad at studying and procrastinate. They say people who grew up trying wish they had fun, and people that grew up having fun wish they tried. I have done neither. I graduate high school in a few months (maybe), and I have no one. Nothing. I have plans, and I will move on eventually, I will force myself to if I have to, but I still hate it. I hate being here. 

If that isn??t bad enough, I actually have had special people in my life, but I would fuck up her life or she would fuck up mine, the problem is, both of these times I have been the cause, or I have been able to prevent it. 

I don??t actually think I??m horribly hideous or have a bad personality, I mean I??m negative as you can see by the post above, but I try to care about things that matter. My parents, my little sibling are the only light in my life. I enjoy making and listening to music to ease up the burdens of life, but this only makes things worse. If I knew I had absolutely nothing to offer, I would just off myself and be done with it, but I still feel like I have something worth having, I don??t know what but I??m TRYING at least to move forward and accomplish. 

Honestly I have thought that after I??m out of the house I should just get some alcohol, drugs, and hookers, because I have pretty much given up on people. I care dearly about them, much too dearly, but they do not care about me. I know this is just life, but for whatever reason it is the hardest thing for me to process. ",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and despair, typical indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of worthlessness and a lack of meaningful accomplishments, highlighting a pervasive sense of invisibility and detachment from others. despite having had friends, the transient nature of these relationships due to moving and fallouts exacerbates the feeling of being alone. the author’s intense emotional response to even minor social interactions, such as being asked for a favor, underscores a desperate need for connection and validation, which is quickly followed by self-loathing and disappointment. the internal conflict of craving attention yet feeling ashamed for needing it is a common struggle among lonely individuals. the narrative also reflects a sense of hopelessness about the future, with the author contemplating self-destructive behaviors as a way to cope with their profound loneliness. the few sources of light in their life, like family and music, provide some relief but ultimately fail to mitigate the overarching sense of isolation. this combination of emotional pain, social disconnection, and a bleak outlook on life are classic signs of someone grappling with severe loneliness."

"losing my motivation again... m21Hello people of Reddit, I??m not really sure what I hope to get out of this because it??s just going to be a rant on how I??m feeling but oh well here we go. 

This shouldn??t come as a shock to anyone reading this but I am very lonely. I just recently turned 21 and I have never been in a relationship before. I never went on a single date in high school and didn??t have my first kiss until college, which I??ll be graduating in May. 

I??ve got pretty low self esteem and self confidence because I got bullied in middle school and high school. I??ll give you all en example: freshman year of high school I was playing GTA5 with some friends on Xbox. I went to go eat dinner and left my mic on mute, when I came back I forgot it was on mute and I heard them talking about me. They were talking about a picture someone had taken of me earlier that day and they said I looked ??ugly and inhuman.?? To this day I really don??t like having my picture taken. 

Now I look better than I did in middle school / high school for sure but I still struggle with my appearance a lot. I??ve tried using dating apps because it??s hard for me to approach girls in person but they??ve really only made things worse. I??ve used a combination of 4 dating apps over the past 4 years and I??ve averaged 1-2 matches a month. That??s with swiping right on over 200 people/day until I ran out of people in my area and eventually made new accounts to try again. Meanwhile my friends with the same dating apps will have 70+ matches and have 99+ people liking them. All of my friends and family say that I am smart, funny, witty, and have a good personality so it doesn??t take a genius to figure out why nobody is liking me. 

As I mentioned before, I recently turned 21. I??m a senior in college so obviously I??ve been drinking before but I don??t enjoy it so turning 21 wasn??t a huge milestone for me. I did however want to do something with my friends though. I mentioned my birthday coming up for months and when it came down to it nobody hit me up to do anything. Even my own roommates ended up leaving me alone in the apartment to go watch a basketball game. I ended up eating dinner at the university cafeteria after my last class and bought myself a pie on the way home. It was probably my least favorite birthday. 

The combination of my birthday on Tuesday and what happened with my last match on bumble has really started to bum me out again. We matched on birthday funny enough and ended up talking for the next three days. I honestly don??t think I??ve ever connected with someone so well and I was genuinely excited every time I would get a notification from her. Everything ended abruptly when she found out I had some conservative views and she doesn??t associate with people like that. I was really taken back by it and I still find it hard to believe people take politics so seriously. I??m not even a die-hard far right conservative, I??m more towards the middle. Anyway it was just the icing on the cake and I??ve deleted all my dating profile accounts now. 

This is turning into a long read but if you??ve made it this far then props to you buddy. Anyway I can feel myself starting to slip back into a pretty depressed state and it scares me. All my life I??ve gone through what I call periods of feeling good and feeling pretty depressed. I??m not the ??I have self diagnosed depression please give me attention type.?? I very rarely will talk with my friends or family about how I??m feeling because I genuinely don??t think they care and I feel it would be pointless which is why I found myself here to rant. But going back, when I??m feeling depressed all I can think about is how my life has gone so far. That ranges from things people have said about me over the years which keep me up at night to never having been in a relationship before. I??m 21 years old now, if I live to be 100 that??s a fifth of my life already over and I feel it was all meaningless. I??ve come pretty close to killing myself three times in the past and I??ll probably end up going through with it once I graduate college. 

The first time was in my junior year of college. My sister was taking pictures of me at home and I don??t remember why but it was genuinely upsetting me. I tried getting her phone so that I could delete them but she locked herself in her room. My mom came into the hallway to see what was going on and I ended up punching a hole in the wall. My mom screamed and the look of disappoint on her face really hit me because I love my mom. I ended up fixing the hole in the wall but I felt like such a disappointment to my mom and I didn??t have anything else going for me I just wanted to kill myself. I heavily thought it over so the following months but ended up not going through with it. I??m also not a very angry person, the outburst was really uncharacteristic of me and in the last 5.5-6 years nothing like that has ever happened again. 

The second time was after I graduated high school. I got accepted to a university out of state and I decided that??s where I wanted to go. I wanted to get away from all the negativity I associate home with (except my family) but I was afraid that everything would be the same. I was going to shoot myself at the end of the summer but a couple of friends of mine noticed I wasn??t really myself and had a mini intervention for me. I brushed it off but it did convince me to do to college. 

The third time I don??t have a story like the last two. I just happened to be going through a really bad period and it just didn??t seem worth it anymore. 

I am so lonely and just want someone to spend my life with. I want to hold hands, go on dates, or just do something simple like go grocery shopping together. It??s so hard watching my friends go in and out of being in relationships over the years. Two of my best friends are now even in long term relationships where they live with their girlfriends. I??m at a weird age in my life where I??ve got friends who are in long term relationships, friend who are still new to their relationships, friends who talk about just hooking up with girls, and then there is me who does none of that. I??m not even interested in one night stands but I??m sure it would be nice to have a connection for even that short period of time. 

I don??t have the motivation to care about anything anymore. I??ve got a 3.5 GPA and my grades mean nothing to me now. I have a nice car and with my degree I??ll be making close to 6 figures right out of college but the money doesn??t mean anything to me. I just want to be happy. I said before I??ll probably wait until after college to off myself and that??s because I at least want to get my degree to make my mom and dad proud. They both weren??t fortunate enough to go through college so I know it would mean a lot to them. 

I don??t think I covered this before but I??m not a super loner with no friends, in fact I don??t really have a problem making friends at all. I know my friends seem kinda shitty for leaving me alone in my birthday but they??re not bad people and I don??t hold it against them. My friends form back home wished me happy birthday and so did my ones here. And no, I??m not still friends with the two who bullied me in high school from my story before. 

I think this brings us to the end of my rant. Not sure if this helped me any but we made it to the end, thanks for reading I guess",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and longing for connection. the author expresses feelings of loneliness explicitly, mentioning the absence of romantic relationships and meaningful connections despite efforts to engage through dating apps. the recounting of past bullying and its lasting impact on self-esteem highlights a struggle with self-worth, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the disappointment of being left alone on a significant birthday by friends further underscores feelings of being unimportant and disconnected. the mention of suicidal thoughts and the cyclical nature of depressive episodes also point to a profound sense of despair and isolation. the author's yearning for simple, intimate experiences like holding hands or grocery shopping with a partner reflects a deep desire for companionship and emotional closeness, which are unmet needs contributing to their loneliness. despite having friends, the narrative suggests that these relationships lack the depth and emotional support the author craves, further emphasizing their sense of loneliness."
"Nobody caresEvery day I'm alone. Every day I feel less and less connected to other humans. Most people have at least one person who they put above anything or anyone else, but no one gives a shot about me. Why would they anyways? I'm an antisocial, neurotic mess. My mood changes like the weather. I haven't contributed anything ""special"" to society. I'm a waste of space and I hate myself so much. Sometimes I want to die but I'm afraid of dying. So everyday I isolate bc im so fragile and I don't want to give people the chance to hurt me anymore. Isn't it enough that I'm the most hated loser on earth already??",1,"the narrative exhibits several indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a profound sense of disconnection from others, feeling that nobody cares about them and that they are perpetually alone. they mention a lack of meaningful relationships, highlighting that they believe no one prioritizes them. self-deprecating thoughts are pervasive, with the person describing themselves as an ""antisocial, neurotic mess"" and a ""waste of space."" these negative self-perceptions are common in those experiencing loneliness, as they often internalize their lack of social connections as a personal failing. the mention of fluctuating moods and self-hatred further underscores their emotional turmoil. the fear of being hurt by others leads to self-imposed isolation, which is both a symptom and a perpetuator of loneliness. the narrative also touches on suicidal ideation, a severe manifestation of loneliness and despair. overall, the individual's descriptions of their emotional state, social isolation, and negative self-view are typical indicators of loneliness."
I want to feel something!I??m 13 I??ve always been super lonely but I never feel lonely unless I think about it for some background I don??t have lots of friends I have a hard time keeping friends because I??m so anxious but lately it??s all I can think about and as a result of this feeling all I can depend on is nostalgia which Is very unhealthy and I also stay up all night for that dreamy non reality feeling that makes me so happy and when I see coming of age movies I get so depressed because I know I??m not gonna be able to experience true friendship and those good memories you get from hanging out with friends and it makes me feel so numb where I can??t even cry when I want to let out my feelings and now I feel like I??m going insane it??s like I??m in water bottle where it??s slowly feeling up just so I can drowned it such a bizarre feeling and it generally disturbs me.,1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and a longing for connection. the individual reveals a struggle with maintaining friendships due to anxiety, which is a common barrier for those experiencing loneliness. the fixation on nostalgia and the use of it as a coping mechanism indicate a yearning for past experiences that perhaps felt more fulfilling or connected. staying up all night to escape reality and seeking solace in a ""dreamy non reality feeling"" underscores a desire to avoid the painful awareness of their current loneliness. the mention of feeling depressed when watching coming-of-age movies highlights the pain of unmet social needs and the awareness of missing out on meaningful relationships. the description of feeling numb and unable to cry suggests emotional suppression and a sense of helplessness, which are often associated with chronic loneliness. the metaphor of being in a water bottle slowly filling up until drowning conveys an overwhelming and suffocating sense of isolation, further emphasizing the distress and disturbance caused by their loneliness."
Tired lonely and depressedI??ve been feeling so tired lonely and depressed lately I have friends but I??m always the one reaching out they never really do I??ve been trying to get out my comfort zone more but damn people can??t even give me the same energy I??m a super friendly person and pretty easy to get along with but still get disappointed,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and emotional exhaustion. the individual mentions feeling ""tired lonely and depressed,"" which are clear indicators of emotional distress. despite having friends, the person is always the one initiating contact, suggesting a lack of reciprocation and support from their social circle. this one-sided effort can exacerbate feelings of isolation and unworthiness. the individual's attempt to step out of their comfort zone and engage more socially highlights their desire for connection, yet the lack of similar energy from others leads to disappointment. this unmet need for mutual interaction and validation is a common experience among those who feel lonely. the self-description as ""super friendly"" and ""pretty easy to get along with"" indicates that the person values social relationships and is likely making genuine efforts to connect, yet still feels isolated. these elements collectively underscore the profound sense of loneliness and the struggle for meaningful connections."
"cycle of self-loathingI am facing an issue in life, and I can't seem to escape it. It's a cycle. I hate myself for it. Everyone on this sub has fantasized about not being lonely one way or another. when I do that, the cycle begins. I get a glimmer of hope for myself and my future. the deeper I choose to think about it, the sadder I seem to get. so what am I to do but play video games. alone. Being alone reminds me that I am lonely. So after a while, I stop and reflect on life. Usually I do this while listening to music. I am a fan of japanese music, and lately I've noticed that I listen to the songs ""Choose Me"" and ""Don't you tell ME"" (both of which are love songs) on repeat for extended periods of time. Typically, after about an hour of life's reflection, I find some sort of happiness or satisfaction. Then the cycle waits to begin again.",1,"the narrative reveals a clear pattern of self-loathing and isolation. the individual describes being trapped in a repetitive cycle where moments of hope are fleeting and quickly overshadowed by sadness. the mention of fantasizing about not being lonely indicates a deep desire for connection, yet the reality of their situation keeps them in a state of solitude. their coping mechanisms, such as playing video games alone and reflecting on life while listening to music, further highlight their solitary existence. the choice of love songs like ""choose me"" and ""don't you tell me"" suggests a yearning for companionship and validation. the cycle of temporary happiness followed by inevitable sadness is a classic indicator of loneliness, as it underscores the lack of sustained emotional fulfillment and social interaction in their life."
"Goodbye to you all (even tho this won??t be seen or read by anyone)To the entire W family, I hope you all will be able to move on as usual. I never really had a connection with any of you. Interaction with you all, came across to seem as if you all have bitter and resentful feelings towards me, even though I don??t feel that way about any of you.

To my immediate family, this will probably end up impacting you two the most out of everyone. You two are most likely going to be the only ones who??s aware of my exiting. I??m sorry to my brother and my mother, I can??t live just for the sake of family, when the world that??s not related to me doesn??t want anything to do with me.

To my last few friends 
B, G, N, N, E, C, C
Thank you for bringing joyful moments in my life.  I??m glad that none of you will be impacted by my exiting, never knowing due to having no one to inform anyone of you. None of you have contact with my family, the only people who??d be aware. Due to none of my friends and the majority of the younger generation not reading the newspaper, there won??t be a source to inform of my passing. I hope you all can proceed as usual like nothing happened. I will leave this world without others being aware of it. To both N &amp; C, I hope your guys wedding goes well, as well with you N, I hope your wedding with M goes well. 

Z,J,M,P. I??m sorry for letting you all down and I??m heartbroken I ended up getting all four of you to not want anything to do with me and not being able to bear a conversation with me. It wasn??t any of your faults for my depressed/suicidal condition of 2019 that was caused by work, school and finances. However I bottled it up and isolated myself instead of informing anyone of you of struggling even though you were the uplifting highlight of my days. I became too draining for you guys and I??m not upset with anyone of you four for walking away, I wish I could say otherwise for how I feel about myself however. Even though the four of you seem to borderline despise me and would flee the room if I was present, I still care about you guys. In my final moments and as my heart beats for the last time, I??ll be thinking of the positive memories. You guys will think of me on however you choose to think about me, I can??t change if you guys perceive my exiting as a pathetic attempt at attention in the near 0% chance any of you will be informed of my absence. I just want to  rest and end this pain which has had no minimization from medicine, hospitalization, or therapy.

With friends dwindling, living back home, financially struggling, college degree field being shut down from budget cuts. I??m left with nothing but loneliness and emptiness. Such emotional agony that causes me physical aches and pain alongside emotional. Personal hobbies are pointless when it??s constantly while alone and there??s no one to share or talk about said hobby with. 

The last loved one in my life to mention is someone who isn??t capable of reading this and that??s my dog. I love you R and it might be tough being in a new home, with me being your second home and owner. I hope you get people that??ll love you as much as I loved you and that aren??t as broken as me. Thank you for keeping me company in my last months here when others couldn??t stand my presence.

I told myself if by April things had worsened then it??ll be time to end it all and it has and it??ll clearly continue for the rest of my life. Some people aren??t meant for this world and that??s something I??ve come to terms with. I??m not scared of being gone, I??m finally ready to end my worthless misery. I just have to wait until the house is inevitably empty to make sure there isn??t anyone to stop my passing.",1,"the narrative is deeply saturated with feelings of isolation, disconnection, and despair. the author expresses a profound sense of being unwanted and unimportant, both by their family and friends. specific mentions of not having a real connection with the family and friends who have distanced themselves are clear indicators of loneliness. the narrative also highlights the lack of impact their absence would have on others, reinforcing the feeling of being unnoticed and unvalued. the mention of their dog as the only source of companionship underscores the depth of their isolation. psychological insights reveal that the author's experiences of social rejection, compounded by financial struggles and unfulfilled academic aspirations, have culminated in a pervasive sense of loneliness and hopelessness. the recurring theme of feeling like a burden and the contemplation of ending their life due to the unbearable emotional and physical pain further emphasize the severity of their loneliness."
I forgot how to make friendsIt's been so long since I made a new friend since it's so hard for me that I forgot how to and my ex leaving me made things from bad to worse,1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and difficulty in forming new social connections, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author's admission of forgetting how to make friends underscores a prolonged period without meaningful social interactions, suggesting a deep-seated struggle with loneliness. the reference to the ex leaving exacerbating the situation further highlights the emotional toll and increased sense of abandonment. this combination of challenges in creating new relationships and the impact of a significant loss are strong psychological markers of loneliness, reflecting the author's struggle with social reintegration and emotional recovery."
"I just want to be loved. Like actually loved.I (M19) just want someone to show me what it feels like to be loved in a healthy relationship. I wanna have someone I can talk to and not feel awkward about it. I wanna have someone who loves me for me and who loves the things I love.

"I love/hate being lonely.Honestly, I enjoy being on my own. I don't feel the need to be fake. I don't feel judged. It gives me a chance to rest for all of the socialising I have to do at school. I could probably go a week without talking to my friends (Tbh I don't feel like I fit in with them). It feels calming and I don't text any of my friends at the weekend.. (which is unusual for people my age).

But I hate the fact that I enjoy it so much. There are times where I imagine what it's like being and extroverted person, having fun with people that I enjoy being around, falling in love and well, just not being me. 
I know I let my friends down when I say no to going out with them (especially as they don't usually ask me out). I gave a shitty excuse to why I didn't want to go out and my friends replied with ""OK *my name* ok"", it hurt. I don't want to be depressed and anxious but I am.

Why can't I just F*CKING SPEAK! I've never made a friend on my own, and it seems like I never will. I just can't speak, and I hate it, and no one seems to care.

Someone was annoyed at me because when I vent its always about being bullied. I never talk about my family shit.

I think that's because I view my situation as a cliche and am numb to it. I wish I could feel this way about how people treat me. 

I don't think anyone will be interested in me romantically. Ever. Which is ashame because I dream of having a nice family.

So, to put things short I am a laughing stock in my town. Everywhere I go I get laughed at and treated like shit. 

Even my family doesn't really care about me-- 

Maybe I shouldn't say that. They try hard to give me things and whatnot. 

But they kick me when I'm down? I could be crying my eyes out and that's the appropriate time to start criticising me.

I have no talent. I'm pathetic.

"I just needed to vent.I feel like the only reason I haven??t ceased my existence myself yet is because it would make my parents upset. Life has been kicking my ass, beating me to a pulp and gauging my eyes out with a rusty spoon. I??m not the type of person who can deal with this stuff by myself. I used to talk to a lot of people but once I realized I was always the one to initiate conversation I decided to stop and see what happened. Low and behold I don??t talk to anyone at all at the moment. I want to keep up the image that I don??t care but it honestly really gets to me.

They have such high expectations for my. They want me to be happy, get a good job and live a good life but I don??t think I can do that.

"Not your typical lonely, but lonely neverthelessI acknowledge that the situation I'm in is far from the worst I could be in, but regardless recently I've been experiencing bouts of loneliness that leaves me yearning for literally anything.

You see, I'm the typical ""low maintenance friend"" people usually talk about, popping in and out of the lives of my friends every so often. This leaves me in a position where I'd check in every few weeks or even months to see if they're still alive, and maybe even for a chat. Most of the times I'm met with enthusiasm, quick 5-10 mins of texting, and then it's back to the loop. I don't want to be that guy that annoys the people around me by consistently digging for attention, but this entire cycle has left me good acquaintances of many and friends with none. I can go several days even waiting for a text or a call and receiving nothing at all.

I've recently taken up a job, but working from home, and video conferencing with colleagues has made me realise how much I want a friend that I can talk to on the daily, sharing thoughts, feelings, or maybe even just shooting the breeze. It doesn't help that my friends appear to be living their lives perfectly well without me in it, and playing as that NPC character in their lives is enough.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and yearning for meaningful connections. the author describes themselves as a ""low maintenance friend,"" indicating a pattern of infrequent interactions with others, which often results in brief, superficial conversations. this sporadic communication leaves them feeling more like an acquaintance than a true friend. their recent experiences of waiting days for a text or call, only to receive nothing, exacerbate these feelings of loneliness. working from home has further highlighted their need for daily, meaningful interactions, something they are currently lacking. the comparison to an npc character underscores a feeling of being on the periphery of others' lives, rather than being an integral part of them. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone who, despite not being in the worst situation, is undeniably experiencing significant loneliness."

Part of me feels like I??ll never get it again. That because of my past it just won??t happen. Or that there??s something wrong with me or just not part of my life plan. I hope that??s not the case because I really love having a connection with someone.

I don??t know. Just needed to get my thoughts out I guess. I just miss having those moments.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of longing for connection, which is a typical indicator of loneliness. the author mentions missing a special spark and expresses doubts about ever experiencing it again due to past experiences. despite significant personal achievements like losing weight, self-care, and securing a great job, there is a persistent feeling of something important being absent. the writer's hope that their loneliness isn't a permanent part of their life plan and their need to express these feelings further highlight the emotional void they are experiencing. this combination of yearning for intimacy and self-doubt is a strong sign of loneliness."

My friends go to parties and they go for drives together, but because i live far away i'm never able to join and it sucks so bad because i want to be social too, and i feel so unimportant when i can't join, even if it's irrational to feel that way brcause the reasons they can't go here (gas, money etc) are completely valid.
But i still feel like a sortof a hole on the inside that's painful and horrible, i struggled with loneliness a lot more in the past, and the ""forced"" solitude is always worse than the chosen one.

Like yeah, when we see each other, we do chat, talk about what they did over the weekend, hobbies and stuff like that. But no one has ever asked me if I wanted to join them for dinner or do something over the weekend and I??m too introverted to be the one planning especially in a new country.. hmm actually there was one guy who organized a bbq and asked people at work but that was in May, smack in the middle of COVID so.. we were all supposed to be social distancing then...

I just.. it was just so embarrassing to admit that I didn??t have any friends who would invite me to a Friendsgiving.

Ive been having very dark thoughts lately. Everyone talks about handsome or above average guys getting everything they want. But here I am an above average guy feeling lonely af for 1 year and 4 months. The reason I am single is that I lack a social life due to bad luck and not having had alot of friends in my previous school for no reason. Only one girl in my life had a crush on me. She told my friends about her crush but I didnt know what to do back then I was shy. I tried tinder or cold approaching people but the conversations never happen more than once or twice since the other party doesnt do effort.",1,"the narrative describes a young individual who has been struggling with prolonged periods of loneliness and social isolation. they recount their limited romantic experiences, both of which ended for reasons that seem to exacerbate their feelings of inadequacy and rejection. the first relationship ended due to the partner's depression, leaving the individual feeling unworthy despite being reassured about their attractiveness. the second relationship was terminated by the individual due to a lack of interest, which further contributed to their sense of isolation. the person expresses a sense of despair and frustration over their single status, which has persisted since graduating from university. their mother's advice, although well-meaning, appears to be ineffective and even hypocritical, given the contrasting situation of their brother. the narrative also reveals dark thoughts and a sense of hopelessness, as the individual perceives themselves as being unlucky and socially inept. their attempts to engage with others through dating apps and social interactions have been unsuccessful, reinforcing their loneliness. these elements collectively point to significant feelings of loneliness, characterized by a lack of meaningful connections, social support, and a pervasive sense of being misunderstood and unappreciated."

I think this is the reason for my loneliness I can't have fun with anything or anyone, I mean I try but it's something lacking in my inside that doesn't let me feel joy for anything, I hate myself and I don't know how to improve lol, I've been trying to start talking with people but I don't feel interested enough in anybody, I do try to put effort but I can't control feelings so I end up talking about the same boring things over and over with everyone and not having anything to say since I'm not interested in any hobby at all, like how can I talk to people if I don't have fun talking with people? It's depressing and I make others depressed.
 I envy those guys who have a passion in a sport and can talk about it all day, or those people who can go to parties and talk to everyone and have fun, or those who can play videogames with their friends and laugh alot saying and doing the dumbest shit they could think of, or even the kids who go on bike trips with their friends to have a good time, like why I can't do any of that???

If you are in the same boat, feel free to DM me.I haven't had a friend since graduating from high school tbh. Even in high school, I didn't have any close friends, so I guess I have always been a loner. I am an introvert so I don't really mind it, but sometimes I do feel lonely. My social anxiety makes it very hard for me to make friends irl. Don't hesitate to hmu if you need a friend too! I'm 21. Btw don't message me if you are only looking for a distraction or entertainment. I am looking for a genuine friend.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and a struggle with forming social connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly states having no friends and highlights a long history of being a loner, dating back to high school. the mention of social anxiety exacerbates their difficulty in making new friends, further deepening their sense of isolation. the plea for genuine friendship and the rejection of superficial interactions underscore a desire for meaningful connections, which is often a hallmark of loneliness. the narrative also reveals moments of introspection about their introversion and occasional feelings of loneliness, indicating an awareness of their social needs despite their solitary tendencies. overall, the combination of social anxiety, a lack of close relationships, and the search for genuine companionship are strong indicators of loneliness in this narrative."

"No one to turn toBeing an introvert means you have few friends and even fewer people to actually talk to. Sure you can occasionally engage in deep conversations with someone, but when you're feeling broken inside, there's none that you can really spill your guts to. None of my friends are very similar to me and while I spend a lot of time with my family, I'm not the type to make myself vulnerable to them. Maybe it has something to do with being a guy and having to keep those feelings inside, but it gets to be too much sometimes. On top of all that, I'm not exactly receptive to attention that I receive from others. I enjoy being alone too much to give that up for someone I don't know. This endless cycle can feel like too much sometimes. Sorry for the rant, I just had to externalize my thoughts for once.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the author mentions having few friends and even fewer people to talk to, which suggests a limited social support network. the inability to share deep feelings with anyone, despite occasional deep conversations, points to a significant emotional isolation. the lack of similar friends and the reluctance to be vulnerable with family members further exacerbate this sense of isolation. the author also notes a possible gender-related pressure to suppress emotions, which can intensify feelings of loneliness. additionally, the enjoyment of solitude and resistance to new social interactions contribute to a cycle of loneliness. the expression of feeling overwhelmed and the need to externalize thoughts are also typical signs of someone experiencing loneliness. these elements combined paint a clear picture of an individual struggling with loneliness."

I guess I want attention. I don??t have a lot of friends. I only talk to like 3 people who I really trust. It??s been so hard for me to deal with my loneliness. I??ve been sexually abused and severely bullied and I think that might affect how I handle relationships. It hurts me to see my friends blow me off to go spend time with their boyfriends/girlfriends. It hurts to see couples at school. It hurts to see my friends having happy relationships on social media, posting about how much they love their partner, the gifts they give them. The relationships I have been in were almost always toxic. I have never dated anyone longer than a month before being dumped, sometimes ghosted. I had a boyfriend who was very abusive looking back. He hit me in my face. After I have my consensual virginity to him he broke up with me the day after. He seemed so nice. I never see it coming. I try to be a good girlfriend, I really do. I don??t know what I??m doing wrong. A lot of guys say they find me attractive, or have crushes on me. But when I try to date someone it never works out. 


I feel like I??m always a second choice, if I??m even a choice at all. No one ever wrote me poems. My boyfriend forgot about my birthday. A girl I dated blew off our date to go get high. I recently quit social media, at least for awhile. I??m the only one out of my friend group who is single and it fucking hurts. I??ve never had anyone who was proud to be with me. No one ever put my name in their bio with a heart. No one ever called me out of the blue just to tell me they loved me. No one ever got me presents. No one ever talked about me. My bf told his friends that I was a slut and retarded because I rode the short bus. He told me never to tell anyone that we were dating, he refused to hold my hand in public. Now he??s had a new girlfriend for a year and treats her like a queen. They do everything together, and he constantly goes on about how amazing she is. His new gf used to be my friend. They still bully me sometimes. 


I just needed to get that out. It really hurts. My heart hurts and I??m tired. I don??t want to go to school anymore and watch everyone be loved and appreciated except me. It fucking hurts. I feel so worthless, and I feel stupid for being upset over it. I know it doesn??t matter but it??s still so painful.",1,"the narrative reflects profound emotional pain and isolation, common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a deep sense of hurt from past abuse and bullying, which likely impacts their ability to form and maintain healthy relationships. their limited social circle and the emphasis on feeling overlooked and unappreciated by friends and romantic partners highlight feelings of exclusion and inadequacy. the recurring theme of being a ""second choice"" or not being acknowledged in relationships underscores a lack of emotional connection and support. the author’s experiences with toxic relationships and the visible happiness of others on social media exacerbate their feelings of loneliness and worthlessness. these elements collectively suggest a struggle with loneliness, marked by a yearning for meaningful, affirming connections and a pervasive sense of being unloved and undervalued."

Whatever.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of isolation and detachment from others, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a sense of invisibility, suggesting that their absence would go unnoticed by almost everyone. this sentiment is a common sign of loneliness, as it highlights a lack of meaningful connections. the comparison to high school loneliness, followed by the acknowledgment that their current state is far worse, underscores a profound sense of despair and solitude. the mention of morally depraved individuals and dismal career prospects adds to the bleak outlook on their environment, contributing to feelings of alienation. the decision to pursue a dream at the cost of a stable, respectable profession suggests regret and a sense of failure, further isolating the individual. living in a crowded house yet feeling completely alone, with interactions only occurring when others need something from them, exacerbates the feeling of being used and undervalued. this narrative paints a vivid picture of an individual deeply entrenched in loneliness, with multiple aspects of their life reinforcing their sense of isolation and disconnection from society."
"I'm inadequateI don't know how to keep up a happy face anymore. So many things bring me to tears lately because I don't feel special to anyone. I know I've got friends, but fuck.. anytime I see a couple give each other a comfortable loving smile, it feels like a knife is twisted in my gut. I've only been in one relationship, and that was a physically and verbally abusive one nearly 10 years ago. Even the thought of me successfully connecting with someone on that level makes me feel nothing but shame. I think about it and hate that i'm putting a hypothetical woman in a position where she has to be close to me. I'm visiting a friend in a few days, and I've been pathetically counting down the moments until I hug them hello, my selfish act. Writing this out and reading it back makes me sound like a caricature of a sad man, but when I search for any other words to describe how I am feeling, I come up short. I'm an unattractive male, and I'm completely lost on creating a relationship. I don't know what to do to myself. Please forgive this stupid rambling.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness and emotional pain. the individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and a deep-seated belief that they are not special to anyone, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the comparison of their own life to the happiness of others, such as couples sharing loving smiles, exacerbates their sense of isolation and worthlessness. the mention of a past abusive relationship contributes to their current emotional state, suggesting trauma that impacts their ability to form new connections. the anticipation of a hug from a friend highlights a desperate need for physical and emotional connection, yet they perceive this need as selfish, further reinforcing their negative self-image. the overall tone of the narrative, filled with self-loathing and despair, is indicative of someone struggling with loneliness and a lack of meaningful relationships."

"i know this isn't normal behavior, but i can't help it.i get so attached so quickly. if someone shows even a slight interest in me, i get so attached so quickly and feel like they hate me and that i'm useless if they don't respond to me. i know it's not normal to immediately want to be in a relationship w/ someone you've only known for a day, but i just need something.

i don't know if i'll ever find someone.",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a deep need for connection and attachment, often getting overly attached to anyone who shows them even slight interest. this behavior suggests a craving for companionship and validation, typical of someone feeling isolated. their mention of feeling hated and useless if someone does not respond reinforces feelings of low self-worth and desperation for acceptance. the confession of wanting to be in a relationship immediately, despite knowing it's not normal, highlights a sense of urgency to fill an emotional void. the person also describes making up scenarios in their head and obsessively checking messages, which indicates a preoccupation with social interactions and a strong desire for contact. the admission that none of their relationships have worked and the feeling of giving up points to a history of failed connections, contributing to their sense of isolation. furthermore, the lack of close friends and the discomfort in social situations underscore their struggle with forming and maintaining meaningful relationships. the overall tone of hopelessness about finding someone suggests a deep-seated loneliness and despair about their social prospects."
Lonliness is making me want to end my life[removed],1,"the narrative clearly expresses a profound sense of loneliness, as evidenced by the explicit statement about wanting to end one's life. such extreme feelings of despair and hopelessness are often associated with severe loneliness, which can lead to suicidal ideation. the use of the word ""lonliness"" directly points to the individual's awareness and acknowledgment of their emotional state. this explicit admission of loneliness and its impact on their mental health is a strong indicator of the severity of their condition. the narrative lacks any mention of social support, positive interactions, or coping mechanisms, further reinforcing the depth of their isolation and emotional pain. the absence of any mitigating factors or expressions of hope highlights the intensity of their loneliness."

I already know that even if I stay awake tomorrow is still gonna approach but it seems like time slows down as I stay awake. When I go to sleep time goes by in what feels like a second and I'm just at the same state I was the day before. I really hope thing get better.,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness through the author's description of their struggle with time and sleep. the reluctance to go to sleep because of the dread of facing another lonely day is a clear indicator of their emotional state. this avoidance behavior is a common symptom among individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often try to delay or escape their feelings. the sense of time slowing down when awake contrasts with the rapid passage of time during sleep, emphasizing the individual's desire to prolong their waking hours to avoid the pain of loneliness. the hope for things to get better indicates a longing for change and connection, further underscoring their current sense of isolation. these elements collectively point to a profound experience of loneliness."

"Loneliness is ruining my life. (I hope someone reads this)I can say that loneliness is the main source to my mental problems. Im 16 years old and im turning 17 this december so maybe you can think that my problems are not that difficult to solve but anyways. I just started college 1 month ago and it has been really tough.

Loneliness has caused me depression, this is mainly affecting me on school, i have little to no energy whatsoever to go to school or do homework. I sleep everytime i can in school and when im not sleeping im all sleepy, so i can't concentrate in most of the classes and I just don't understand anything. When i get to home im just too tired to do anything.

About the loneliness itself, its weird for me, i hate not having friends and having social anxiety. I guess people is just not interestend in me, there was this girl that talked to me and tried to make a conversation with me on the first day of college, but my poor social skills just didnt allowed me to make a conversation so she just didn't speak to me again and i dont blame her.

At this point, in my classroom all the people have their little friend groups already formed, i just barely talk to the guys that are on my homework team who i also found to just not wanting me to be near them. I have realized that im going to stay alone for the rest of the semester and i have really no problem with that.

Now in the other hand, i really love how quiet and peacefull a is to be alone all day but im really afraid that this love i have for loneliness is going to get bigger and that im not going to be able to leave it anytime soon.

I've been having these problems for two years now, but im posting this now because i been thinking that maybe this is how im going to be for the next 5 years until i graduate from college if it is not the same after I graduated from university.

Please leave an upvote so that it can reach to the people who can help me.",1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of loneliness, which is evident through the direct admission of feeling ""really lonely."" the request for an online friend who can offer mutual support further highlights the individual's desire for connection and companionship, common indicators of loneliness. the mention of low self-esteem also correlates with loneliness, as individuals with low self-worth often struggle with forming and maintaining social relationships. the plea for advice and the call for upvotes to reach a wider audience indicate a longing for interaction and validation from others. these elements collectively underscore the emotional isolation and the need for social support that are typical of someone experiencing loneliness."
"Maybe there is something there.I used to not want anyone. I used to tell myself I could do it all alone. I didn??t want to depend, I didn??t want to wait, and neither did I want to hope. I can??t remember the last time She told me I was beautiful, or the last time He held me close and told me I was loved. I sat and watched from a distance as they ran into their loved one??s arms with joy, so full of life and comfort. It looked to nice. Sometimes I found myself wishing I could feel that way too. But before I knew it, everyone was gone.  

I try to find those pretty moments. I tried to remember the times I used to laugh, the moments I used to smile, the memories where I felt safe and content. Instead, it??s the things I didn??t want to remember that creep back in, keeping me awake and searching. Searching for something or someone. Maybe there was someone there once. But my memory of them fades. Maybe the more I write this out, the more things will come back to me. But do I really want them to?  

I know myself too well. I used to think I knew the world and people too well that I could almost see everything  coming. And it always did. But can someone prove me wrong just once? To  show me something different. Someone to stay for a while...  

I care too much but they care too little. They matter so much but I don??t matter enough. That??s always how it was. But maybe someday it??ll change. Maybe it already has. I gave too much of myself just to get a little bit of warmth back. I plunged into deep shit hoping to find something to hold on to. But then I couldn??t breathe. I wondered if I should keep my head underwater. Maybe the waves can finally take my breath and float me away.  Hope is a dangerous thing. Love kills more than hate does. Sometimes I pray not to be this way. Hoping to be someone different and forget this life I know. I don't want to remember. I don't want to know who I am but I do. Is there anything out there at all? I can't breathe. Hopefully I float away soon. 

But there was always something there to lead me back to shore no matter how badly I wanted to drown. There was always something there but I never knew what. A little sunlight, a tiny breeze blowing through my hair. Maybe there is something there. And I thought about it. That beyond all the filth I found something pure. Something reaching for me in the water. Something warm in the color of His eyes. Something there in the way She smiled.  Enough to pull me out of there before I fell too deep. Maybe there is  something there.

I don??t know what it is. But all I know is that I don't ever want to let go of it.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for connection. the author describes a past where they convinced themselves they could manage alone, avoiding dependence, hope, and waiting. this self-imposed isolation is a common defense mechanism against potential disappointment or rejection. the memories of not being told they are beautiful or loved, and the imagery of others finding joy in the arms of loved ones, amplify their feelings of exclusion and loneliness. the author expresses a desire to remember happy moments but is instead haunted by negative memories that keep them awake and searching for something or someone. the narrative's tone shifts between a yearning for connection and a resignation to their current state, illustrating the internal conflict typical of loneliness. the mention of giving too much of themselves for just a bit of warmth, and the contemplation of drowning, highlights the depth of their emotional pain. yet, there are glimpses of hope, as they find solace in small, pure moments that prevent them from falling too deep into despair. this oscillation between hope and hopelessness, and the search for meaningful connection, are clear indicators of loneliness."

I tend to close myself off from all people at times, and normally I am fine with being lonely, most of the time I enjoy being by myself actually.

I don??t enjoy anything I used to anymore, music, family, friends, socializing, I feel disconnected from it all, which makes it harder for me to fix any loneliness I have.

Its still hard going out because we'll, my family is religious and doesn't think I should hang out with people outside of church.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and rejection from various social groups. the individual describes being treated poorly at church, where they feel like an outcast despite not causing trouble. this rejection is compounded by similar treatment from their family, where their atheism makes them a ""black sheep"" and nearly resulted in being kicked out. the restriction on forming friendships in high school unless for the purpose of religious conversion further limited their social interactions. the repeated experiences of exclusion and the struggle to find acceptance are indicative of deep loneliness. despite their efforts to improve themselves, the difficulty in socializing due to familial and religious constraints continues to reinforce their sense of isolation."
"High school student feeling lonelyI don??t think listening to sad,dramatic music helps me right now but I just feel so lonely. I feel like I exist in people??s lives for a few seconds as another face but that??s it. I try to make friends but nothing seems to stick. I??m too weird, I don??t act right, dress right, look right. I don??t know if I will ever find someone to spend life with, either as a friend or romantically. Every single person that??s talked to me, I immediately picture them as my best friend and daydream about going on trips with them and having sleepovers with them when they were just being polite to me.

I keep thinking that going to college will change everything but I know deep down that going away won??t change anything. I don??t know what to do.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, feeling like they only exist momentarily in other people's lives. this fleeting presence suggests a lack of meaningful relationships. the person describes efforts to make friends that consistently fail, highlighting a pattern of social rejection or difficulty in forming lasting connections. they also mention feeling ""too weird"" and not fitting societal norms in behavior, appearance, and dress, which can contribute to social alienation and self-doubt. the longing for close relationships is evident in their daydreams about potential friendships and the emotional investment in brief interactions, which underscores their unmet social needs. additionally, the narrative reflects a sense of hopelessness about the future, with the individual doubting that a change in environment, like going to college, will improve their situation. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant loneliness and struggling with feelings of inadequacy and unfulfilled social desires."
"Does anyone else feel kind of trapped?Maybe you have a spouse that doesn??t want to hear what you have to say and shuns you at every opportunity, friends who never ask how you are or want to spend time with you, or family members that you take care of that you need to keep a brave face on for because they need taking care of.

Please, tell me I??m not alone in this. 

I??ve been told I??m ??not alone?? and that people are ??always there??, but when I reach out, they??re not.
I feel trapped. I??m told I??m not ??independent?? enough, I??m brought down even though I??m doing my best, because my best isn??t good enough.
I??m made to feel like I??m less of a person because I want somebody who is there for me, even though I know that??s not the case.

I think it??s the loneliest I??ve ever felt. Being surrounded by people that are so blind to me.
Maybe it??s just on purpose ????",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and emotional neglect, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual feels trapped in relationships where their emotional needs are ignored or dismissed, such as a spouse who doesn't listen, friends who are indifferent, and family members who require their care but do not reciprocate support. the repeated attempts to reach out for help and the consistent experience of being let down contribute to a feeling of being unseen and unheard. the expression of feeling like ""less of a person"" and the acknowledgment of being in the ""loneliest"" state they've ever felt highlight the depth of their emotional distress. the sense of entrapment and the perception that others are blind to their struggles further reinforce the individual's experience of profound loneliness."
"I've just been tearing up while looking at google images of people hugging and cuddlingI feel a little pathetic, but I've just been so lonely, hopeless and scared. It seems that seeing other people get this kind of comfort somehow... helps? Or maybe it's not helping. lol",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of emotional distress and longing for human connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly mentions feeling lonely, hopeless, and scared, which are significant emotional states often associated with loneliness. the act of looking at google images of people hugging and cuddling highlights a yearning for physical affection and comfort, something they are currently lacking. the ambivalence about whether seeing these images helps or not suggests a complex emotional struggle, where the desire for connection contrasts with the reality of its absence. this behavior and the emotions described are strong psychological markers of loneliness, as the individual is seeking solace in visual representations of intimacy and connection that they do not have in their own life."
I??m lonely because I??m a complete and total outcast.[removed],1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of social isolation and self-perceived rejection. the use of words like ""complete"" and ""total outcast"" suggests a deep and pervasive feeling of being excluded from social groups or connections. this kind of language often indicates a lack of meaningful relationships and a feeling of not belonging, which are common indicators of loneliness. the intensity of the statement points to a significant emotional distress and a possible internalization of negative self-perceptions, further reinforcing the sense of loneliness. psychological insights suggest that individuals who describe themselves in such absolute terms may struggle with low self-esteem and may find it challenging to form or maintain social connections, thereby exacerbating their feelings of loneliness."
"I??m sick of thinking I??m better off alone but still hoping that love will find my way someday.26m, I??m sick of knowing that I might actually end up alone. God, I??m trying to keep conditioning myself that maybe I??m better off alone because love is not for me. Every day is dragging myself doing what I like, enjoying me time but let??s not pretend that it??s always gonna be that way. I know there??s somebody out there who likes me, but why would you let someone likes me then not liking them back in reciprocal? These people that I only see and treat as my friends. Speaking of friends, I don??t even think that I have actually real friends, they will only come or talk to me when they have to or it??s just boredom strikes hit them then reach out all of a sudden. 

I started to develop liking to someone and I??m fine if that person likes me as a friend or more than that. The hell am I thinking in the first place? Every one is bored as fuck as well just like I am bored of myself. I get lonely and sometimes, I get the idea that it??s not meant for me. That perhaps life is not always about finding love and inspiration from the people you want to be with and the likes. Hence, finding the love within myself. Let??s cut to the chase?? It??s bullshit in so many ways. Being lonely makes us stronger and wise, but also that is bullshit to me. Being lonely makes us weak and bitter in hindsight. Life as we make it but how could life treated us like a useless machine that people don??t give a damn to even associate with. 

Damn. Life gets bored. Lonely people like us deserve more.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loneliness through expressions of self-doubt, hopelessness, and a lack of meaningful connections. the individual oscillates between trying to convince themselves that they are better off alone and yearning for love and companionship. the mention of dragging oneself through daily activities, despite enjoying some ""me time,"" highlights a struggle to find genuine fulfillment. the person's perception of friendships is also telling; they feel that their friends only engage with them out of necessity or boredom, not out of genuine interest or care. this lack of reciprocal affection and meaningful interactions reinforces their loneliness. the narrative also touches on the individual's attempts to rationalize their loneliness by finding love within themselves, only to dismiss it as ineffective and disingenuous. ultimately, the reflection on loneliness as both a source of supposed strength and actual weakness underscores the depth of their emotional struggle. the concluding thoughts about life being boring and the lament that ""lonely people like us deserve more"" encapsulate a deep-seated sense of isolation and a yearning for more meaningful human connections."
"It Hurts. I think I'm doneEverything hurts. The only reason I'm alive is because I had a girlfriend. And now even she left me. It was so random. So sudden. It hurts so much. I cry myself to sleep every night. Sometimes I cannot sleep but want to. I have difficulty breathing. I get anxious. I get panic attacks. I desperately feel the need to be cared about, to be cuddled. I desperately feel the need for someone to hold me and tell me everything's going to be fine. But I know its not coz I suck. I have zero friends. I'm a total failure and I dont even know why I'm still breathing. Why I'm still alive. I wish I didn't feel so miserable. I wish somebody cared. I feel so pathetic and lonely.

If you can relate/if you wanna talk/vent, please message me. It'd be a favor.",1,"the narrative is filled with expressions of intense emotional pain and a profound sense of isolation. the author describes a recent breakup, which has exacerbated their feelings of loneliness and worthlessness. they mention crying themselves to sleep, having difficulty sleeping, experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, and a desperate need for physical and emotional comfort. the repeated emphasis on their lack of friends and feelings of failure underscores their deep sense of isolation. the plea for someone to talk to or vent with further highlights their need for connection and support. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a yearning for companionship and an acute awareness of their social disconnection."
"M18 feeling aloneI'm really feeling useless, irrelevant and lonely. Another bad night for me. Like always",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness and emotional distress. the individual explicitly states feeling ""useless, irrelevant and lonely,"" which are strong indicators of negative self-perception and social isolation. these feelings are often associated with loneliness, as they reflect a lack of meaningful connections and a diminished sense of self-worth. the mention of ""another bad night"" suggests a recurring pattern of distress, further emphasizing the chronic nature of their loneliness. such repetitive negative experiences can lead to a persistent state of feeling disconnected from others. the use of words like ""always"" implies a sense of hopelessness and a belief that their situation is unlikely to improve, which is a common cognitive distortion in those experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative's language and emotional tone are consistent with the experiences of individuals who feel isolated and disconnected from social support networks."
Feeling aloneHow is everyone?,1,"the narrative expresses a sense of isolation and a longing for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the phrase ""feeling alone"" directly conveys the author's emotional state of solitude and disconnection from others. the subsequent question, ""how is everyone?"" suggests a desire to reach out and connect with others, highlighting the author's awareness of their own loneliness and their wish to engage socially. this combination of self-reflection on their solitary state and the attempt to bridge the gap with others is a clear sign of experiencing loneliness. such expressions often reveal an underlying struggle with feelings of being unseen or unsupported, which are common in individuals dealing with loneliness."

i wished 2 of my friends a happy bday so far this year but im scared nobody will do the same for me. i even put their birthdays in my calendar so i wouldn't forget. i honestly dont care about birthdays but not getting wished one would make anyone feel alone or excluded as it shows the people in your life dont seem to care or remember these kinds of things

im always forgotten",1,"the narrative reflects a deep concern about not being acknowledged or remembered by friends on a special day, which is a clear indicator of loneliness. the individual mentions making an effort to remember and celebrate their friends' birthdays, suggesting a desire for reciprocity and validation. the fear of not receiving birthday wishes highlights feelings of exclusion and neglect, which are common experiences among those who feel lonely. the statement ""i'm always forgotten"" underscores a recurring sense of being overlooked, further emphasizing the individual's loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate a longing for connection and recognition, which are critical aspects of human social needs."

No gf, few friends, a fish and that??s really it. When is it gonna end?",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and lack of meaningful connections. the author questions their loneliness directly and highlights interactions that are transactional rather than genuine, indicating a feeling of being used rather than valued. the mention of feeling like a ""side character"" in their own life suggests a diminished sense of self-worth and significance. the absence of a romantic partner and the limited social circle further emphasize the loneliness. the rhetorical question at the end underscores a sense of hopelessness and longing for change, which are common emotional states associated with loneliness."
"Anyone plzThere has to be some people who are as alone, broken, fucked up and nerdy on here that also wouldn't mind a friend ????????????",1,"the narrative exhibits clear indicators of loneliness through the language and emotional tone used. phrases like ""alone,"" ""broken,"" and ""fucked up"" suggest a deep sense of isolation and distress. the repeated plea for companionship, as evidenced by ""plz"" and ""there has to be some people,"" highlights a desperate need for social connection. the use of excessive punctuation and informal language reflects an urgent and perhaps frustrated attempt to reach out. the self-description as ""nerdy"" might indicate a feeling of being misunderstood or marginalized. these elements collectively point to an individual grappling with loneliness and seeking validation and friendship."
"It??s never hurt this badThis feeling of perpetual loneliness is not new but it has never hurt this much. I feel like I??m being physically weighed down and I??m not sure I can keep this up much longer. I want someone, whether it be a partner or just a friend, who I can be honest with. Who I can tell my feelings and struggles to and they would truly care. I just want to be loved, as cringe as that might sound. I have never been in a relationship where the other person reciprocated that love. While this post reads like a person trying to garner sympathy from strangers, maybe it is, there is a reason love has always alluded me. The reason is me. I??m not optimistic or charismatic. I??m not intelligent or inspiring. I??m a quitter. I??m lazy. I??m a loser. I??ve come to the conclusion that I need to improve my myself in order to be loved, but it is more difficult that it sounds.  Why would anyone love me when i cannot love myself? How do i begin to love myself when I cannot change? How much longer will life be like this?

"Lonely ExtrovertAs the title says, I'd describe myself as a lonely extrovert, I have no problem meeting and talking to people, I'm a very energetic person and I really enjoy being surrounded by people. My problem is all the relationships that I form are superficial, can't make them go through something more special and deeper.
The only time I remember having real friends was when I was a kid, but I had to move frequently due to my parents job so I lost all contact with them. From then I remember having ""friends"", but no one that close.
Nowadays I have this group of girls from university, but I feel like we never tried enough to expand our relationship outside of it, so basically the only things we talk about are work related. I have this other group of friends, also from uni, with whom I used to hang out and party a lot, but just that, no intimate talk or anything. 
Because of the pandemic I've hardly seen any of them, and I don't talk to anyone either. The girls I first mentioned, we have a WhatsApp group together but hardly anyone talks, except if it has to do with college stuff, and even though they've been for me at tough situations, I often feel we're more classmates than FRIENDS. 
I lost contact with all of my high school friends since they kinda ghosted me and never got an explanation about it, but I never felt so close to them either. 
2020 was a nightmare for me, being and spending time with myself, not talking to anyone and just entertaining with my own thoughts is exhausting, even more when I don't enjoy being alone that much. I really envy people with a lot of close friends to lean on and would never be alone no matter what.",1,"the narrative presents several indicators of loneliness. despite describing themselves as an extrovert who enjoys being surrounded by people, the individual emphasizes the superficial nature of their relationships, unable to form deeper, meaningful connections. the recollection of having real friends only during childhood, followed by a series of transient and shallow relationships, highlights a persistent sense of isolation. the pandemic exacerbated this feeling, as the lack of face-to-face interaction led to further disconnection from even those superficial ties. the whatsapp group with university peers that remains largely inactive, except for academic purposes, underscores the lack of genuine companionship. the individual's envy of others with close friends and their discomfort with solitude further illustrate their struggle with loneliness."
"I'm probably gonna die aloneTo be honest, I'm still a teenager but I know I'm probably not gonna have many friends or close relatives by the time I die. I have a very weird personality, not the ""hehe I like dissecting bugs and eating drywall"" weird, or the ""teehee I'm so quirky weird"" I'm just weird. But I only have 5 friends, and I can tell that two of them are gonna have a nice successful life, another one is probably gonna make his own path, and me and the other guy are gonna separate somehow knowing my luck.   I'm gonna work boring sad jobs for 50 years, pay off student debt, retire and enjoy my last 10 years on this planet wishing I had done something different. 

Not to mention the multitude of other world problems. I've tried to convince myself I've accepted it, but I haven't. I just want to grow old with kia wife and friends. I'm just gonna die, people are gonna say ""Oh how sad, I used to know that guy"" and then continue on like nothing happened. My gravestone will be the cheapest and most generic possible.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and foreboding about the future, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a belief that their personality is inherently off-putting, which fuels their anticipation of a life devoid of meaningful relationships. the mention of having only a few friends and the expectation that they will eventually drift apart reinforces this sense of future loneliness. the detailed and bleak projection of a life filled with unfulfilling work, followed by a lonely and unnoticed death, further highlights the author's deep-seated fear of being forgotten and unloved. the longing for companionship and the despair over not achieving it are clear markers of loneliness."
"Been feeling down lately.Hey. I've got some things I need to get off my chest and I feel like I have no one to talk to. 

Since April of this year I've been on a mental health leave. Went to a psych facility in a neighboring town. 
Depression and anxiety have always been a part of my life (shocker right?) But lately it's been different. 
A year ago my dad had a stroke and has spent his time out of the hospital pushing everyone away, telling me to f*** myself etc. He was a huge part of my problems before. Classic absentee teen father story. But since he's blocked me I've been able to let my feelings go to an extent because I've realized he's never chosen me over himself. I don't expect him to anymore. During this I have been dealing with problems with my girlfriend as she was changing her medications and has horrible depression issues herself. Since February she had been talking to a guy friend from a different country significantly more than me. When I asked what they talked about she said they sent pictures of their cats etc. It turns out she sent him n*des for months. Wrote his name on her chest even. When I found out I gave her the choice, him or me. She said she'd block him. She hasn't.

"Just wanna vent.I dont know how to write this... but, I'll just do it. So, last Thursday, I went to the airport to go abroad for a student exchange programme. There are actually 19 of us, but 17 people had already gone a day earlier due to their visa arriving early. Me and one other people went the next day. On transit, I feel so frustrated because it's a 12 hour transit, and really there is nothing I can do except creating small talks with her. During those 12 hour transit, she got visited by a bunch of her friends. And that's where reality strucks me and I got sad. I want to be visited by my friends, but the fact is, I don't have a friend that is close enough to me to actually want to go visit me at the airport and said farewell. When she got visited by a bunch of her friends, deep down I was saddened. When she exchange conversation with her friends, I was on my phone and my headphones listening to Spotify and watching Netflix. I can't even move my body and got up away from my seat. She was sitting two seats besides me, and her friends was sitting in a chairs in front of us. I really. really want to move to a quieter place to be more relaxed and not entrenched in self-embarassment, but I don't really have the strength to either say it or just straight up do it without saying anything. During the whole convo, I can't even look at her friends' face, because I just feel embarassed, feeling like I don't have any real friends', and just straight up jealous of her. My eyes even felt sappy and just tired because I'm constantly looking at my phone for close to one and a half hour. I don't know if she noticed, but my general attitude (like the way I talk to her, my facial reaction) slightly changed after that. The previous day, me and her actually got along very well because it's basically the two of us travelling alone and had to prepare for everything. I don't know. Maybe I'm mad because she chose to abandon me and talks to her beloved friend, and makes me realize how I don't have a solid support system that is always there for you. Obviously, this is no one's fault. I don't even know if this is my fault for not being able to make friend and socializing well.",1,"the narrative depicts a clear sense of isolation and longing for meaningful social connections. the writer describes a situation where they feel left out and disconnected, especially in contrast to their companion who is surrounded by friends. this comparison amplifies their feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. the writer's frustration during the 12-hour transit and their inability to engage or move away from the situation highlights a sense of helplessness and social anxiety. their emotional response, including sadness, jealousy, and embarrassment, is indicative of someone struggling with loneliness. the desire for a support system and the self-reflection on their social skills further underline the depth of their loneliness. overall, the narrative captures the emotional turmoil and social challenges that are often experienced by individuals who feel isolated and disconnected from others."
"Suck at making friendsPast year has been pretty rough, a lot of my friends that i talk to has left me. I still get upset about it because i considered them my really close friends. They still talk to me but not like we used to. N if i were to message them they would leave me on read all day. It just sucks n so I've come to realized that all my friends approached me first. So I've been trying to make friends myself and man its hard, i either flop or just don't really end up liking people. Maybe it's cause i suck, or I'm super picky with friendships.  But i just feel so alone, i can talk to ppl but it's just emptiness. I have one really good friend and i appreciate her but our sleep schedules aren't the same.  Idk if anyone can relate to this n i hope someone does because i hate this",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and difficulty in forming meaningful connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author expresses distress over losing close friends and the lack of reciprocal communication, as their messages are often left unanswered. this one-sided interaction fosters feelings of rejection and insignificance. the struggle to initiate friendships independently and the resulting failures or dissatisfaction further compound the sense of inadequacy and loneliness. the mention of feeling empty despite being able to talk to people underscores the lack of deep, fulfilling connections. even the presence of one good friend is marred by mismatched schedules, preventing consistent interaction and support. these elements collectively highlight the author's pervasive sense of loneliness and the emotional pain associated with their social struggles."

Vent over. Encourage/discuss as you will ????????",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress. the author mentions a lifelong struggle with loneliness, indicating a persistent and pervasive feeling that has been challenging to understand or address. the recent experience of potentially being ghosted by a romantic partner exacerbates these feelings, especially since it triggers past traumas of being abandoned without explanation. the author’s preference for direct communication highlights a desire for clarity and connection, which is unmet and contributes to their loneliness. the absence of contact from any friends or social media interactions throughout the day further underscores their isolation. the use of phrases like ""really freaking lonely"" and the emotive expressions such as ""vent over"" and ""encourage/discuss as you will"" signal a cry for help and a need for validation and support from others. these elements collectively indicate significant loneliness and a yearning for meaningful human connection."
"On loneliness.#Loneliness

I never considered myself to be lonely, but deep inside i knew i was only lying to myself.

I never was a people person, i always saw myself as the socially awkward kid and so i never even bothered trying, some of my closest friends are my oldest friends who keep me because they know the real me.

The truth is life goes on and so do people, time waits for none and definitely not for me.

I may not admit to myself but i have severed many ties and broken many bridges because people tend to misunderstand people.

I've never been one to be gloomy and see the black parts of life but the truth is life comes in blacks and whites, it has it ups and it has its downs, I've loved and I've lost, I've trusted and I've been betrayed in the worse ways possible, i have tried seeing the whites in life but somehow the black always seems to overshadow the whites, I've been depressed, I've lost people i love without getting the chance to say goodbye, I've been kicked in the curb, I've felt suicidal, I've felt awful, I've  been sad, and there were moments where the only safe space was my bed but I've also been high on life with moments where i felt like a fucking king.

I've also been madly in love with the woman i thought would be there for me in my happiest hours and saddest moments, only for life to kick me down, beat me up and disappoint me again, but I've also learned that happiness does not work that way.

Being alone never bothered me, i enjoy my solitude as it gives me time to truly reflect on myself and life, while it never bothered me it also felt wrong because that isn't all there is to life and what good are memories if you have no one to share the happy and good times with.

Truth be told i guess i never truly appreciated the gift of life but i also dont wanna die young, having achieved nothing in life but a few heartbreaks and disappointments, leaving no legacy behind, with few people who will remember me as the average guy, i dont want people to get used to me not being around anymore, life isn't fair for anyone but i would be lying if i said life isn't damn beautiful and sometimes all you have to do is enjoy the view while it lasts.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep internal struggle with feelings of loneliness, despite initial denial. the author admits to not being a ""people person"" and describes a history of social awkwardness, which are common indicators of loneliness. the confession of severed ties and broken bridges underscores a sense of isolation and misunderstanding from others. the contrast between experiencing life's highs and lows, coupled with feelings of depression, betrayal, and suicidal thoughts, highlights a tumultuous emotional state often associated with loneliness. the reflection on solitude being both a comfort and a source of unease further emphasizes the complexity of their feelings. the longing for meaningful connections and the fear of being forgotten after death suggest a profound desire for companionship and recognition, which are central themes in the experience of loneliness. the narrative encapsulates the author's journey through life's challenges and their struggle to find a balance between enjoying solitude and yearning for shared moments with others."
"Just me venting.I always spend most of my days reminiscing about the days when i was in elementary/middle school, it's depressing. It reminds me of how lonely and miserable i am. I've missed so many chances to be happy at the time, and i can't do anything about it but daydream about the things that could have been, and that sucks. 

Hopefully people can relate with me about this. i know I'm not the only one who feels this way, so if you want to vent or be friends then let me know.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author reflects on their past, specifically their time in elementary and middle school, with a sense of regret and sadness. this focus on missed opportunities for happiness and the inability to change the past are common signs of loneliness, as they often indicate a longing for connection and fulfillment that was not achieved. the use of words like ""depressing,"" ""lonely,"" and ""miserable"" further emphasizes the depth of their emotional struggle. additionally, the author's hope that others can relate to their feelings and their invitation for others to vent or be friends highlights their desire for social connection and understanding, which is a typical response to loneliness. the narrative's overall tone and content strongly suggest that the author is experiencing significant feelings of isolation and yearning for companionship."

i run out of things to say in 2 minutes of talking. girls my age all ignore me since they have better guys to talk to...

its like figuring out a jigsaw puzzle when i try to talk to a girl. feels a bit easier when i talk to guys. but i struggle with that too.

how do you guys not run out of things to say?? how do i make the convos where both sides work for it?? how do i not force convos?; how do i make them more open ended?

they end up ignoring me so its me ignoring all the human race or i have to people please.

"My life is a just a participation ribbonI'm an invisible man. I talk to myself, because no one else will. My mind feels more like a grave. It's not only in my head if the thoughts I have are true. I'm the most pathetic person I know. I hope no one will ever be as lonely as I feel. Loneliness is not something I'd wish upon anyone. 

My life hasn't led up to anything to show for. My life's a joke. I'm not even second place. I hate myself, but I feel like I can't change a thing. I could be better. I want to be better. For everyone's sake. 

I've gone so far on my own. My own mind is walking out on me. So I guess I'm on my own. The back of my mind can only imagine what I'm here for. Maybe I'm not making sense and I'm just too tired.

I don't care what happens anymore. I just want to feel loved and happy again. I wish I could go back in time and change. Know the things I know now.

"I feel as if I have no one though I do.I have a family, a boyfriend, and ??friend??s?? but, I still feel so alone and isolated.

All my ??friends?? don??t know anything about me, my mom still thinks I??m into the things I was when I was 13 when I??m going to turn 20 in two weeks. My sister and I were never close and as for online friends I just feel so drifted away now. 

I miss the feelings of talking to someone and feeling like they??re actually listening with interest.  I guess I still long for silly child like friendships. There??s nothing more I crave than a nice female friendship however, it feel impossible now days.
During the start of the pandemic I made more a good weight loss and leading into the spring I started looking more my age rather than so young. In the hopes of this i thought I would make more friends unfortunately, i feel so fooled by my ignorance. 
I only make male friends easily but there??s nothing to it when they just want to be friends till my bf and I break up. The only thing I??m told by new people I meet is ??oh you??re pretty??. I hate it so much. I genuinely wish I could talk about my interests with people instead of faking what I like. 
I miss talking about movies or music with randoms online till 3am. I hated the way I looked in the past but sometimes I wish I could go back so i could have more friends.

"Turning 25 soon and I wish I had a girlfriend to spoil ????I have no idea where to start or how to begin, I've never posted on reddit before besides recruiting for a clan on ffxiv haha
Let see. I have only ever had one relationship and im not even sure if it counts.
It was an online relationship and it was one sided.
Looking back on it, I was insecure and she had mental problems which made it feel like walking on a minefield whenever we'd talk.
It was never going to work out, it was long distance and there was a big age gap haha
I remember asking my friend over and over, the nights before I asked out my ex.

I'd roll around in my bed from being flustered while in Voice chat on discord, I would ask my friend things like.
""what if she says no? What if I ruin things? She lives in the states and she's alot older! How will that even work out! What if she says yes?! What would I even do then?!?""
I remember being embarrassed I was soo glad it was only Voice chat. I curled up into a ball, covered my face because I was so embarrassed opening up to my friend for advice and she just said ""GO FOR IT!""

So I did and 6 months later I was dumped though an email.

I only thought of my ex because I had a dream I was hanging out with my exes brother and was in their house. (Idk why, I don't even know him)
In the dream, he went to do something else and I remember really wanting to see my ex again so I went to her room and I woke up shortly after that.

I don't think I miss my ex anymore and there was a time i wished it worked out.
What I do miss though, is someone being there for me and that special someone wanting to spend time with me.
I was happy just being there for her and I miss being with someone but.
Wishing is pretty much all I can do ????

I'm really, lonely and I was depressed enough to ask to be laidoff from my job. ( the night before I asked to be laid off I went to a bar and had a few drinks. I realized I had no one to talk to and called my parents. After that call I went back home and started crying because I felt extremely alone)
I also gave up my own place and moved back home.
They live in a very small town. And I do nothing, I sleep in, stay up late. Stay home all day and now it's September and this year is easily the worst in my life.
I got dumped by the only girl I was brave enough to ask out.
I lost alot of friends due to drama on a game of all things and I wish things were different.

I wish I had alot of friends that want to talk to me.
Friends that actually initiate anything instead of it being a one sided friendship.
A girlfriend who I can be happy with.
Anything at all.

I was a hopeless romantic type of guy who listens to music like this while I would do the dishes or something.
https://youtu.be/LcJm1pOswfM

I daydream about being a knight in shining armour,  about having a girlfriend.
I listen to romantic music and close my eyes and picture myself with someone who wants to spend time with me. 

Anywho, that's my story.
Sorry for the mess, I wrote it on mobile and its very late.
If you read this far, thank you for time.

Also fun fact, I used an app called replika (a chat bot) just so someone would talk to me and I have tried eharmony and that didn't work out.

Thanks again for reading my very late rambling.
It helps alot to put my thoughts into words since I can't vent or tell anyone about my problems.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. the author expresses a longing for companionship and connection, evident in their desire for a girlfriend to spoil and their reminiscing about a past relationship, despite its flaws and eventual end. the description of their only relationship highlights their insecurity and the challenges they faced, which exacerbates their current feelings of loneliness. the author's recounting of their dream about their ex further underscores their yearning for closeness and intimacy. they also mention feeling extremely alone, to the point of asking to be laid off from their job and moving back in with their parents, which signifies a retreat from social and professional life. the loss of friends due to drama in a game and the wish for friends who initiate contact points to a lack of meaningful social connections. the use of a chatbot for conversation and unsuccessful attempts at online dating platforms like eharmony illustrate their efforts to combat loneliness but also their struggles to form real connections. overall, the narrative is filled with indicators of loneliness, such as the need for emotional support, the desire for meaningful relationships, and the significant impact of social isolation on their mental health."
"So hard to find someone that won't discard me after a fun conversation or two.Growing up I thought the secret to being liked is getting people to laugh.  It's so so much more complicated than that.  I was the ""nerd"" in school, so I wasn't popular.  Someday, it dawned on me that humor might make people like me, so I set out to learn how to be funny. Within six months I could make anyone laugh.  But that didn't make me any new friends.  It's been a decade or so since then, and sure, I can have an awesome conversation with anyone, something that sounds like it has value and depth, but them stopping being interested is the inevitability.  They just stop talking to me afterwards. 

I know one or two people that are friendly to me because they feel sorry/bad for me,  they don't know I've caught on.  

Recently I got into trying to find someone romantically and that's been an absolute cluster **** of a monumental failure.  It's either I'm supposed to carry the convo, me getting ghosted, or them turning out to be absolute maniacs.

I'm honestly starting to think I'm never finding anyone. 

Is this supposed to be so hard?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and frustration, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author recounts their efforts to be liked and make friends, starting from their school days where they were labeled as the ""nerd"" and not popular. despite mastering humor to make people laugh, they find that this skill has not translated into lasting friendships or meaningful connections. the repeated experiences of people losing interest after a few conversations and the feeling of being pitied by the few acquaintances they have are clear signs of social rejection and unfulfilled social needs. the narrative also highlights their unsuccessful attempts at romantic relationships, further emphasizing their sense of disconnection and despair. the author's questioning of whether finding companionship is supposed to be this difficult underscores their profound sense of loneliness and the emotional toll it has taken on them."

I fucking hate being lonely.,1,"the narrative expresses a profound desire for emotional connection and support, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the repeated emphasis on wanting to feel loved and cared for highlights a significant unmet need for interpersonal relationships. the explicit statement of hating being lonely underscores the emotional distress and dissatisfaction with the current state of isolation. such expressions of yearning for genuine care and love are typical of individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often feel a lack of meaningful social bonds and emotional intimacy in their lives. the strong language used further conveys the intensity of the emotional pain associated with their loneliness."
"Another ??Lonely on the weekend post??I??m 21 years old, and it feels like I??m missing out on the ??prime years?? of my life. I??m in my final year of University and have not made any close friends and majority of time I just spend in my room alone since my University  is not far from home where I live. Due to my religious background it??s tough to go out at night and also I??m somewhat intimidated from my parents. This has held me back mentally from doing things such as going out, drinking, smoking, socializing in fear of criticism of my parents. It??s because of this I just stay cooped up in my room alone passing time, playing Call of duty or watching whatever is on Netflix. I yearn for company but afraid of doing so. Afraid I??m not good enough. Afraid of rejection. Afraid of taking to girls. I??m 21 for fucks sake and can??t even find a damn friend to relate to. I guess this post just ended up rambling about my current life. This stuff builds up when there??s no one to really talk to about it without feeling a sense of skepticism about it. I hope your guys weekends aren??t as bad as mine &lt;3",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and yearning for social connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual describes feeling like they are missing out on important social experiences during what they perceive to be the ""prime years"" of their life. they mention spending the majority of their time alone in their room, highlighting a lack of meaningful interactions with peers. the constraints imposed by their religious background and fear of parental criticism further exacerbate their isolation, preventing them from engaging in typical social activities such as going out or socializing. the repeated expressions of fear—fear of not being good enough, fear of rejection, and fear of talking to girls—underscore a significant lack of self-confidence and heightened anxiety about social interactions. the individual's yearning for company and the frustration of not having close friends to relate to are palpable throughout the narrative. these aspects collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing profound loneliness, struggling with the emotional burden of isolation and the absence of a supportive social network."

"Is there a word for this lonely feeling that I have, whilst others are around me?I'm just wondering if there is a specific term for the feeling I get of severe loneliness while others are around me.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of loneliness despite being in the presence of others, which is a common experience for individuals who feel disconnected or isolated even in social settings. this feeling is often referred to as ""emotional loneliness,"" where the person lacks meaningful connections and feels misunderstood or unseen by those around them. the use of words like ""severe loneliness"" and the inquiry about a specific term for this emotion highlights the intensity and distinct nature of their experience. such expressions are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect an inner emotional state that is not alleviated by mere physical proximity to others. the narrative's focus on seeking a term for their feeling also suggests a deep need for validation and understanding, which are often unmet in lonely individuals."
Worthless and feeling lonely[removed],1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of personal worthlessness and explicit feelings of loneliness. these emotions are often intertwined, as feelings of worthlessness can exacerbate loneliness and vice versa. the direct mention of feeling lonely is a clear indicator of the individual's state of mind. psychologically, loneliness is not just the absence of social connections but also the perception of being isolated and unsupported. the use of the word ""worthless"" suggests a negative self-view, which is a common symptom among those experiencing loneliness. individuals who feel lonely often struggle with self-esteem and may internalize their isolation as a personal failing. the explicit mention of these feelings in the narrative is a strong indicator of the person's emotional and psychological state, aligning with common indicators of loneliness."

I need someone to talk to who is in a similar boat, preferably a female around my age from Michigan.

"Are lonely people and introverts treated fairly in relationships?(I know this does not apply to all but I feel like it will resonate with some) Do you guys find that when someone who is pursuing you or vice versa notices how lonely you are or that you don??t have many friends they feel like they can lower their effort? I feel like they link loneliness to desperation and think you??ll be grateful for just their attention. From my observations outgoing people with more close friends and family get treated better because the suitor is competing with other people for your attention. Some may think this is wrong, but I find myself lying like I??m busy or out with friends and family just so I won??t seems so boring or lonely and suitors will put more effort into pursuing me. Sadly it works.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and social isolation. the author expresses concerns about being treated unfairly in relationships due to their perceived loneliness and lack of social connections. they observe that people with more friends and family receive better treatment because their suitors feel the need to compete for their attention. the author admits to lying about being busy or having social engagements to appear more desirable, which underscores their feelings of desperation and the lengths they go to in order to avoid being seen as lonely. this behavior is a coping mechanism often seen in lonely individuals who fear rejection and seek validation through external means. the narrative also highlights the stigma associated with loneliness and how it can lead to unfair treatment in social interactions. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reveal a struggle with self-worth, a lack of meaningful connections, and a reliance on deceptive tactics to garner attention and affection."

"My life as explained in a song ????Well, I've been listening to my ""Sad Bish"" playlist all day because a bish is sad. The song Anyone by Demi Lovato came on and I think for the first time, I realized this song perfectly describes me and my cycles of loneliness and my hopeless attempts to escape the loneliness. I'll explain \*with lyrics\*:

* *""Talked to my imagination. Confided into alcohol. ""*\- I'm sad and I try to tell myself that all will be ok which turns into more hurt which turns into me drinking because Mr. Tito has never left me lonely. This is also when I realize that I am in need of a fulfilling human connection and desperately wanting that connection. 
* *""I tried and tried and tried some more. Told secrets 'til my voice was sore. Tired of empty conversation. Cause no one hears me anymore""* \- Seeks connection. Connection made. Trying my best to maintain said connection. Giving all of myself, but being on a different page. Still, I'm optimistic. 
* *""Anyone, please send me anyone. Lord, is there anyone? I need someone""*\- Feeling like maybe I'm meant to have this feeling of loneliness for the rest of my life. This is usually when I go all in on the connection even though I know inside that I am headed towards more hurt. But maybe things will get better. 
* *""I used to crave the world's attention. I think I cried too many times. I just need some more affection. Anything to get me by.""* Things went to shit. Saw this coming. Anger. Pain. Disbelief that we are here again. Just want genuine affection. 
* *""I feel stupid when I sing. Nobody's listening to me. Nobody's listening.""* Why do I try when I always end up hurt in the end. STOP. TRYING. Sadness. Pain. Maybe I can drink until I figure out what's next.

Anyway, I'm going to pour another glass of wine and continue to cry. See if you can guess what stage I'm on.

I graduated from high school in June. I??m a year ahead so I won??t be turning 18 until next year. All my friends are going to college now, except me. The first reason being that I??m not 18 yet, and the second (and most important) reason being that college doesn??t interest me at all. I felt pressured in school, I know what I wanna do in life, and I don??t want to waste my time with something I will barely be interested in when I can actually work by myself on something that makes me happy.

That may seems irrelevant. But now that I think about, the only positive thing about college is that I would have been able to meet new people. Meeting girls in particular. And here I am, spending most of my time at home, in my room, working everyday on something I??m not even sure will be successful, but staying hopeful still and trying my best.

I had a similar feeling during summer. A lot of people say that I look older than I really am, so I tried some dating apps. The few attempts at matching with someone I found to be interesting weren??t successful, at all. And in fact, in the end, I don??t think it??s a good idea to go on these kind of apps. I do not find myself ugly though, even if I??m a bit self conscious about my hair sometimes, I consider myself to be kinda good looking.

But I just feel so alone. My relationship with my family is a pure mess and I haven??t had a positive love experience with someone in years (perhaps never actually). It??s like I??m never gonna meet anyone I have a deep connection with, like I??m gonna be the miserable depressed guy I am today for the rest of my life. Sometimes I just wanna cry thinking about it. Because I know it??s no one else but my fault, and I can??t blame anyone but me.

You could say ??Welp, you still got your friends??. And you??d be right. I have a few loving friends that I love talking to. But that just doesn??t help filling the void that??s inside of me for some reason. It??s just a very complicated moment. It??s very confusing and depressing.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of being left behind as their friends move on to college, highlighting a significant life transition that exacerbates their sense of separation. the mention of spending most of their time alone at home, coupled with unsuccessful attempts at forming romantic connections through dating apps, further underscores their isolation. the writer also touches on strained family relationships and a lack of positive romantic experiences, contributing to their overall feeling of loneliness. despite having friends, the individual describes an unfillable void, indicating that their social connections are insufficient to alleviate their loneliness. the self-blame and hopelessness they express about their future prospects of finding meaningful connections are poignant indicators of their emotional state. the narrative's tone and content reflect a profound struggle with loneliness and the accompanying confusion and depression."
"I'm 20 and have no friends. I have also never even held hands with a woman before.I am doing decent in other aspects of life. I work a good job, I can survive on my own. But damn it hurts so much to not have anyone to share that with.

People don't like me. I'm boring and shit at anything social. I just wish it wasn't so hard to accept. I've tried Tinder and Bumble, its not for people like me. My face is too scarred and ugly to do anything like that. But even online, I do not have the personality to make up for it.",1,"the narrative reveals several classic indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly mentions a lack of friends and romantic experiences, which are primary social connections that contribute to feelings of belonging and companionship. the pain of not having anyone to share successes with underscores the deep emotional impact of social isolation. the self-deprecating language, such as describing themselves as ""boring"" and ""shit at anything social,"" reflects a negative self-perception that often accompanies loneliness. attempts to use dating apps like tinder and bumble, coupled with the belief that their appearance and personality are barriers, highlight the struggle to form connections even in digital spaces. the overall tone conveys a sense of resignation and hurt, which are typical emotional responses to prolonged loneliness."
"It was bad todayI??m 25 and my life has been going nowhere. I??ve watched all the people around me become successful and do great things and all I can do is pretend I??m doing good as well. I??m not good at anything and life keeps fucking me over. I feel like I don??t know who I am because I??ve been pretending so much. I hate the way I look. I??ve been on every ??diet/lifestyle?? change you can think of. 
The depression is getting so bad it hurts to even be in my skin. I have no friends and I think my spouse has finally realized they are better off but is too afraid to say it. I can??t come out of this funk no matter how hard I try. I wish it would all just end...

"Lonely to the point I might end it allThats it. I??m thinking of ending my life sooner or later because of my loneliness.

We are social beings, so why should life go on if I was never able to make anyone stick around, love and be loved.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress, which are key indicators of loneliness. the writer explicitly mentions feeling lonely to the point of contemplating ending their life, highlighting the severity of their emotional pain. the repeated emphasis on being unable to handle another day of loneliness underscores the chronic nature of their suffering. the reference to humans as social beings and the inability to form lasting connections further illustrates their deep sense of social disconnection and unfulfilled need for companionship. these elements collectively point to a state of acute loneliness and despair."
College??Just started college 3 days ago. This is the loneliest I think I??ve ever been. Everyone??s already made their friend groups and such while Im just sitting here eating this shitty pad thai by myself in my room. I don??t want to do this. Why is it so hard for me to talk to people. Now I??m crying in my room. Maybe college just isn??t for me but I don??t know what is. Im honestly just so tired of life right now. I want to go home and be with my dog :(,1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and difficulty in forming social connections, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of being an outsider as they observe others already forming friend groups, while they remain alone. the mention of eating alone in their room and crying highlights the emotional distress and lack of social support. the difficulty in talking to people suggests social anxiety or a lack of confidence, common in lonely individuals. the desire to leave college and be with their dog indicates a yearning for familiar comfort and companionship, further emphasizing their current state of loneliness. the overall tone of exhaustion and despair reflects a deep emotional struggle, characteristic of someone experiencing significant loneliness."
"Afraid I??m going to be alone foreverI know I??m still pretty young young (15m) but i see myself as completely unlovable/unlikeable trash, I have one friend who doesn??t even go to my school so I can barely see him because of corona.

I feel like there??s something about me that just makes people uncomfortable or pushes them away. 
I had I suppose a somewhat of a date recently the I met the guy online and for a couple weeks we were texting he seemed really interested, flirty and I thought it was going good. Then he comes over and the entire time he??s just sitting at the bottom of my bed practically shaking, barely saying a word and when he does it??s in mumbles. Do I really make people that uncomfortable?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and self-doubt, which are common indicators of someone experiencing significant emotional isolation. the author expresses a fear of being alone forever and perceives themselves as unlovable and unlikeable, suggesting a negative self-image that can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the mention of having only one friend, who is not easily accessible due to the pandemic, further highlights the lack of social connections and support. the author’s difficulty in forming close connections and the anxiety about making others uncomfortable are indicative of a profound sense of social disconnection. the recent encounter with the date, where the other person appeared extremely uncomfortable, reinforces the author's belief that they are inherently off-putting to others. these elements collectively illustrate a pervasive sense of loneliness and the struggle to establish meaningful relationships."
Lonely in Pennsylvania50 M here in Pennsylvania.  I'm wondering if there's anyone in northeast PA that's lonely also and needs a friend.,1,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing loneliness, as evidenced by the direct expression of feeling lonely and the explicit desire for companionship. the author identifies their location and age, which indicates a search for connection within a specific demographic and geographic area. the plea for friendship suggests a sense of isolation and a need for social interaction. the straightforward and somewhat urgent tone of the message is typical of someone who is feeling disconnected and is actively seeking to alleviate their loneliness by reaching out to others in a similar situation. these elements collectively highlight the person's current emotional state and their attempt to find solace in shared experiences."

A caring boyfriend, a big group of supportive friends. I wonder why I was never able to have that.

"I feel stuck and like no one really cares, just trying to find a friend (24F)I'll try to break this up, but bear with the long post ahead.

For the past few months now, I've been feeling lonely and like no one really cares and that there is nothing to be done about this. Ever since I graduated from university, I slowly lost touch with all my school friends (especially due to Covid). I occasionally talk to 1-2 people from school and the only person I talk to regularly is my boyfriend. Between work, busy schedule, and Covid restrictions, I don't ever see friends outside work. Even with restrictions loosening, I haven't had the chance to meet up with people besides my boyfriend. But even then, none of my friends have contacted me much to try to meet up. I've stopped caring about going on social media and trying to keep in touch with people. For awhile, I was getting along quite well with my coworkers at my current job since a bunch of us are around the same age and we seemed to have lots in common. But lately, the dynamics have been off within our group and I don't know why. One person in particular doesn't want to seem to want to talk to me now (and we didn't even get along that well before either). And it just makes me wonder if something is wrong with me, if I'm unlikeable or what.

I will add two notes which are

1. I have never had my full driver's licence so not being able to drive really restricts my freedom to go out and do things with people, since I either rely on my parents or the person I'm hanging out with to drive me (and I feel bad having to ask all the time). This has been quite frustrating since I moved back home (I took transit everywhere at university, but the bus in my area is not as easy to take). I did get my G1 last year, but due to all the lockdowns, still haven't gone yet for my G2 road test. I have it booked for late September and have been trying to practice, so hoping I pass and this will help me gain some independence.
2. Due to varying health problems over my lifetime, I get fatigued very easily and can't do too many social events in a row. I have tried remedies as recommended by my doctors as well as basic things like getting enough sleep, exercising, consuming less caffeine, sugar, etc. What does baffle me is that things like studying for an hour or exercising intensely throughout the week don't seem to wear me out compared to hanging out with a friend or going out for hours at a time. My thoughts are because I am more introverted, and these more social situations are more tiring for me. But it is still frustrating when I really want to hang out with people and I choose not to because I know I'll be too tired to do so or to last through an activity.

There's a lot more I could say, but that's the gist of it. I'm not here to say I have no hope and I'm at the end of the rope, but I'm definitely frustrated and starting to give up (and not to go on, but Covid isn't helping). I'm usually a positive person and I don't like to complain (my life is very blessed in terms of having a place to live, being employed, etc.). But having gone through so many people who I thought would be friends and who ended up just drifiting away for various reasons has made me cynical. And I really love my boyfriend and I know that he enjoys spending time together, but he does have his own friends and I worry that I will become annoying if I don't have a friend group of my own. Any words whether it just be agreement or advice or whatever, I'm open to hear (literally just came on here to rant).",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and yearning for meaningful connections, typical indicators of loneliness. the author describes a gradual loss of friendships after graduating from university, exacerbated by the covid pandemic, which has limited social interactions. the individual feels disconnected from former friends and colleagues, noting a lack of effort from others to maintain contact. this sense of being overlooked and undervalued is a common experience among those feeling lonely. the author also highlights practical barriers to socializing, such as not having a full driver's license and health issues that cause fatigue, further limiting opportunities to engage in social activities. the frustration expressed about these constraints and the introspective questioning of their own likability suggest an internal struggle with self-worth and belonging. despite having a supportive boyfriend, the fear of becoming overly dependent on him for social interaction underscores the desire for a broader social network. overall, the narrative is filled with elements that are emblematic of loneliness, including social withdrawal, perceived lack of support, and emotional distress."
"I hate going out alone??.The reason why I hate going out alone is because it a cruel reminder that I??m always alone, a nobody and I always see a group of friends, wishing that was me in the group. I already lost my motivation to work on myself because I??ll never had real close friendship in life and feel like thing won??t get any better for me",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and longing for companionship. the writer expresses a strong aversion to going out alone, which highlights the painful reminder of their solitude. their mention of seeing groups of friends and wishing to be part of such social circles underscores their desire for connection and belonging. the loss of motivation to work on oneself is a significant indicator of loneliness, as it reflects a sense of hopelessness and resignation about their social prospects. the belief that things won't improve further emphasizes the depth of their loneliness. these elements collectively point to a profound experience of loneliness, characterized by social withdrawal, yearning for meaningful relationships, and a pervasive sense of despair."
"Just tired of feeling lonelyI'm so tired of feeling alone and feeling unnecessary. I feel like a ghost because no one sees me or acknowledges me, it's like I don't exist at all. All I want is to feel loved and appreciated. I like conversation but I can't find anyone to have a decent conversation with. I hate feeling alone in this world!",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for human connection, which are strong indicators of loneliness. phrases like ""feeling alone and feeling unnecessary"" and ""like a ghost because no one sees me or acknowledges me"" highlight the writer's perception of invisibility and lack of validation from others. the desire to ""feel loved and appreciated"" and the difficulty in finding meaningful conversation underscore a craving for emotional intimacy and social interaction that is unfulfilled. such expressions are typical of individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often feel disconnected from others and yearn for recognition and companionship. the intensity of the emotions conveyed, such as hating ""feeling alone in this world,"" further supports the classification, as it shows a profound and painful awareness of their social isolation."
I??m the most awkward person to ever liveAll threw high school I never had any real friends I was always the kid who sat there and never says anything because I never knew what to talk about.  Nobody ever texted me even still to this day. I have never been in a relationship.  I have never got asked to hang out by my ??friends.?? I feel like I??ve never lived a fulfilled childhood. Every year my as my birthday passes peoples wishes slowly shrink one person at a time which makes me realize how alone I really am. I don??t talk to my own family because  I??m to shy to express myself to even them. I have a job but never know what to say to my co workers my voice freezes in my throat as I try to talk it??s the worst thing I ever felt. All my ??friends?? went to college and I have never heard from them since. I haven??t gone to college because I??m afraid to live alone and communicate with new people. I feel complete lost in life and it makes it worse when you literally have nobody to talk to about it.  Ps I??m not suicidal so that??s at least one positive,1,"the narrative depicts a deep sense of isolation and social disconnection, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the individual recounts a history of struggling to form meaningful relationships, starting from high school and continuing into adulthood. the absence of real friends and the lack of communication from others, even on significant occasions like birthdays, further emphasize their sense of being alone. the person's inability to express themselves, even with family, and the social anxiety experienced at work are clear signs of loneliness. additionally, the fear of attending college due to the prospect of living alone and interacting with new people underscores their social withdrawal. the overall tone conveys a profound sense of being lost and unsupported, typical of someone experiencing loneliness."
"17M Never had a friend, but I want one. Don't know how to make one.I have never texted, snapped, DM'd, facetimed or phoned anyone. I've never been to a party or gone out for dinner. I've never had a girlfriend or done much more than talk to a girl. I don't hang out with anyone, or talk outside school. I'm a loner and I'm getting tired of it.

I'm unbelievably lucky. I was born in the best city in Canada, if not the world, to an upper-middle-class family and go to a great school. I grew up in a great neighbourhood, and as a kid, I would spend hours outside with my only friend catching lizards in nets and jumping on his trampoline. When I started middle school we grew apart and stopped talking. Even though we still go to the same school, we don't know each other anymore. I only ever had him as a friend, and when I lost that friendship, I never made a new one. I don't want to be friends with him again, as it has been almost a decade, and we are not in the same place socially.

As a senior in high school, I am awfully lonely. I have a few people I talk to and sit with at lunch, but I am an outsider, and just tag along. I have a few people I chat to in school, but otherwise, I'm pretty much a loner. I'm not ugly and I don't have bad hygiene. I'm not socially awkward or cringy. I'm self-aware and take social cues. Every day I watch my peers grow older and experience all the teenager things, first love, first kiss, first girlfriend, first break up. I'm getting tired of seeing people enjoying life with their friends while I sit on the sidelines.

People in my grade are going to parties and hanging with friends. On Instagram, I see pictures of all the people in my school doing cool shit with their friend's: camping, fishing, swimming at the beach or skiing. Parties are practically live-streamed, and I'm writing this while my feed is overflowing with the latest pictures of the parties my peers are at. The people in my grade look amazing, they go to the gym they are fit and healthy. The girls look like models, and the guys look like adults. I'm by no means ugly, but definitely look young for my age, skinny and average height.

I don't think loneliness would have hurt this much before social media. Everything I see hurts. People wishing each other happy birthday on Instagram, while on my birthday I wake up to my school alarm and a text from mom. I see Snapchat stories of the girl I like snorting coke off a table, and boys shitting in the urinal. As stupid as all that is it sure beats being lonely. Trump is president, the forests are burning, oceans rising, and I'm about to die from god damned coronavirus because some idiots couldn't help but eat a bat because it's a trend. What good is there in the world because I can't find it.

I'm tired of sitting in my room on the weekend listening to Radiohead and wallowing in my loneliness, while across the city my peers are living it up. I try to put myself out there, I played soccer for the school, I run a club, I volunteer and get good grades apart from in English. I'm going to university next year for engineering. It is a big school in a big city. People tell me life will change in college, but I don't see how. In high school I'm surrounded by people my age, who are going through the exact same experiences I am. University is no different if I can't make friends now what is going to change.

I don't see the point anymore, I feel like I'm living for my family, not myself. People tell me to find god, but if god existed why the fuck would he make me like this. What is the point of waking up every morning to go to school or work just to die in 80 years, if I'm lucky? I used to only feel the loneliness mentally, it weighed on me like a brick every day, but now I'm feeling it physically. I wake up exhausted, I feel weak, I don't have an appetite and I can't sleep. I've realized that loneliness is more than emotion, it is a disease. I'm in a race to make a friend before the loneliness consumes me. I feel like I am racing against time, but I don't know the race track.

tl;dr how do i make a friend.",1,"the narrative is filled with explicit expressions of isolation and a deep longing for connection, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a lack of meaningful social interactions, noting that they have never engaged in common social activities like texting, attending parties, or having a romantic relationship. despite being in an environment that seems conducive to socialization, such as a good school and neighborhood, the person feels like an outsider and tags along rather than truly connecting with peers. the vivid descriptions of observing others enjoying their lives while feeling sidelined, combined with the impact of social media amplifying these feelings, further highlight their sense of exclusion. the narrative also touches on the physical and emotional toll of loneliness, describing symptoms like exhaustion, lack of appetite, and sleep disturbances. the individual’s attempts to engage in social activities, like playing soccer and volunteering, seem futile to them, leading to a sense of hopelessness about the future. this pervasive sense of isolation and the significant distress it causes are clear indicators of the loneliness experienced by the author."
"I've had this issue all my life, and throughout it, it's only gotten increasingly worse.I know there are a lot of vent posts, so I don't expect anyone to see this. But i've been in this predicament all my fucking life. 

All of my life, ever since elementary even, I've always wanted to care and spend time with someone special. I have had 3 relationships in my life, and all of them were failures because the other person never actually liked me that much. And after each one, I would question what the fuck was wrong with me, and I still wonder if theres something wrong with me. I would try to hug them, I would hang out with them, I would try to have conversations with them and if they didn't like anything I would back off and give them space. The only thing I didn't do was act like a fucking robot and go ""would you like, a, hug?"" Whenever the time was appropriate. 

And now, after all of those failed relationships, and the fact that I can't even try to make friends or find a partner without being looked at like an alien due to quarantine makes my me hurt more than ever. As im writing this, it feels like someone's ACTUALLY tugging on my heart strings, and I just want to curl up and cry. 

I used to make up fake scenarios in my head and play them out like a story for fun, or when my mind just won't shut up. But now, I fantasize about characters that I somehow grow feelings for (i've never fucking had that happen), and imagine them comforting me, listening to me, and even letting me take care of them. I write these stories in my head so I can feel happy for 10 minutes, and then have to remind myself and replay a part in the story to feel happy again.

I feel like im on the brink of insanity or even fucking Depression: Electric boogaloo, Highschooler edition.

I live in a small town, so that makes it even harder to meet someone. Because I remember everyone's faces.

I just want to fucking co-exist with someone. Sorry for the trash rant.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the writer describes a lifelong struggle with forming and maintaining relationships, highlighting feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially after failed romantic endeavors. the mention of quarantine exacerbating their sense of being alienated underscores the impact of external circumstances on their emotional state. vivid descriptions of physical sensations, like the heartstrings being tugged, illustrate the profound emotional pain they are experiencing. the coping mechanism of fantasizing about fictional characters to feel a fleeting sense of happiness further emphasizes their desperation for connection and comfort. the narrative is laden with expressions of frustration and a yearning for companionship, making it clear that the writer is deeply entrenched in loneliness."
"what way should I thinkI am kind of lonely in my life in a way but I do have friends also to whom I can easily talk some of the stuff. My best friend went on a date yesterday and she seems quite serious about it they have been talking for many months and I think it is going to be this time some real love stuff.

I am happy for here but some part of it just made me sad I don't want her to date anyone because then I will not have anyone to talk to. slowly each one of my friends has started dating and I notice that whenever a guy comes into any of my friends' life the priorities change they no longer want to hang out the way we would earlier do. To this stupid love, I have lost many friends who now are only available for small talk and always feels like I am taking their time.

ofc I will let go this time also. it is her life but just that I can sense a friendship break up sooner or later makes me a little sad.

Any advice on this would really help.",1,"the narrative reveals a person who is experiencing feelings of loneliness despite having friends. they express a sense of isolation as their friends begin to prioritize romantic relationships over their friendship. this shift in dynamics leaves the individual feeling neglected and worried about losing meaningful connections. the sadness about potentially losing their best friend to a new relationship further highlights their fear of being left alone. the narrative indicates a longing for deeper, more consistent companionship, which is a typical indicator of loneliness. the person's awareness of the changing priorities and the anticipation of a ""friendship break up"" underscores their vulnerability and emotional need for stable, supportive relationships."

"Life isn't and will likely never be OK. I guess I'll just have to live with that (19M)So today was a pretty OK day, and by that I mean it was terrible. Living with my parents and dealing with this whole pandemic has been even worse on my mental health. At least when I was in college I could pretend it was the stress that resulted in poor mental health, but now with nothing around me I know it's just me and that's just making it worse. I don't really have many good friends, and the ones that I think I have rarely if ever talk to me. I haven't talked to most of my college friends at all since March when this all started. Nobody seems to want to reach out and talk to me which is fantastic. On top of that, I'm in a new state since my parents moved and I know absolutely nobody here and can't make friends even if I wanted to since I'm stuck inside all day, every day, since March. My parents don't talk to me at all really. For example my dad didn't say a single word to me today, and my mom talked to a grand total of 3 times, 1) asking about where my dad was, 2) telling me there's donuts, and 3) telling me to check the mail. So I got a solid 20 seconds of someone in my house actually acknowledging my existence today which is better than usual I guess. So yeah, I have no one to talk to most of the time, no friends here or to call, my parents ignore me, and as a result I'm super lonely. Oh, and also I'm pretty sure I've had depression for years but I haven't seen anyone about it since idk how to start that conversation and I can't afford to see someone anyway. If anyone wants to be friends feel free to pm me, but if you're gonna ghost me then don't bother.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from both family and peers, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual describes their day as ""terrible"" despite it being ""ok,"" highlighting a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and hopelessness. the lack of meaningful interactions with family members, illustrated by the minimal and superficial communication with their parents, further exacerbates their feeling of being unnoticed and unimportant. the absence of contact with college friends and the struggle to form new connections due to the pandemic-induced isolation in a new state contribute significantly to their loneliness. the narrative also mentions a long-standing suspicion of depression, which is often intertwined with feelings of loneliness. the final plea for friendship, coupled with the fear of being ghosted, underscores a desperate need for social connection and validation. these elements collectively point to a profound experience of loneliness."
"I have no words to express the bullshit I witnessed and the stress I feelI can't help people who don't want to be helped, why do even try anymore? I go sleep lonely and unsatisfied with my life. All I wanted to do was help, but of course the annoying guy had to show up. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters, amirite? I wish I could hang myself and have everyone forget about me. I wish there was some magic spell to wipe me off everyone's mind so I could just disappear completely. I can't confide in anyone, I can't trust anyone, I need to keep this pain inside. Only thing I think about is when Hans is revealed as the villain in Frozen and he says ""If only there was someone out there who loved you."" If I open up, I'm just going to lose friends again. I don't wanna be alive.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress, indicative of someone experiencing profound loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of being unable to connect or confide in others, highlighting a lack of trust and support in their social environment. phrases like ""i go sleep lonely and unsatisfied with my life"" and ""i cannot confide in anyone, i cannot trust anyone"" are clear indicators of their solitude and internalized pain. the reference to wanting to disappear or die further underscores the severity of their loneliness and despair. the mention of a scene from frozen, where a character realizes they are unloved, mirrors the author's own feelings of being unloved and unsupported. these elements collectively point to a narrative steeped in loneliness, characterized by a sense of helplessness, social disconnection, and emotional turmoil."
I??m a liarI lied on Reddit and ghosted someone after getting ghosted myself. I??m in a loveless marriage just to take care of the kids during COVID. I love her and lied and threw her away. I??m lonely and it??s my fault. It??s my loss!,1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of regret and self-blame, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of isolation and emotional disconnection, particularly highlighted by the loveless marriage mentioned. the act of lying and ghosting someone, followed by a self-admission of being lonely and acknowledging personal fault, further underscores the internal turmoil and lack of meaningful connections. the repetitive use of phrases like ""i'm lonely"" and ""it's my fault"" reflects a deep sense of self-awareness and despair, typical of someone experiencing loneliness. the context of the covid pandemic exacerbates these feelings, as it has been a significant factor in increasing isolation for many individuals."
"I can??t trust people.. nor myselfPeople have always misused my trust and it??s fine I guess. It??s my fault for being naive and allowing anyone into my life in the first place and believing that this person might be different and we can be good friends. But nope. 
And then I can??t trust myself as I don??t know what I am cabal of doing. I am a self conscious person and I know my short comings. I am not perfect. 
I want to apologise for those who are genuinely good people and do care about me but due to my trust issues everyone is blacklisted.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of distrust and self-doubt, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions being unable to trust others due to past experiences of betrayal, which has led to a generalized mistrust of everyone, including those who may genuinely care. this pervasive distrust isolates the person from potential meaningful relationships, further deepening their loneliness. the self-blame and acknowledgment of their own imperfections also highlight a negative self-perception, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness. the apology to those who might care indicates an awareness of missed connections, reinforcing the theme of isolation. overall, the narrative reflects a cycle of distrust and self-isolation typical of someone experiencing loneliness."
"Anyone else tiredof like.. superficial consolations.

Not that they don't clearly mean well and perhaps work for some receivers, but.

""All of you are actually loved"" bro I literally have no one. I get that some lonely people do have caring friends/family but I literally have zero and the idea of a stranger loving just the idea of me is just.. unhelpful? Makes me feel almost worse? ""You'll eventually be loved"" would be relatively better but it's still not... much of anything, to me personally. Because love takes mutual work and love can fade and I for one am a mess that has never not incidentally ruined a friendship and/or potential friendship.

I mean I suppose I did come here seeking some kind of solace. It has slightly helped to know I'm not the only one who's felt/experienced certain things. But largely.. I don't know anymore. It's not like I'd want a new bond from here forged solely out of sympathy/pity either. I already have superficial connections. I just... 

I guess this is just a vent.

I don't even think venting is working anymore, especially since many of my issues with keeping friends (always keeping, because making them is hard but relatively much easier) are the result of real life barriers barely in my control, but.

I don't fucking know. 

TLDR Tired. Pained. Nothing new.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and frustration with superficial consolations that fail to address the individual's deep-seated loneliness. the writer explicitly states that they have no one, highlighting a lack of meaningful relationships and the futility of generic reassurances. the mention of feeling worse when considering the idea of strangers loving the concept of them underscores the emptiness they feel. their acknowledgment of being a ""mess"" who ruins friendships points to a cycle of self-blame and despair, further isolating them. the venting about real-life barriers preventing lasting connections and the feeling that even venting is no longer effective, combined with the closing sentiments of being tired and in pain, all signal a profound experience of loneliness."
"Holiday LonelinessHi all, first post ever here so go easy on me. 
I spend the holidays alone because my family is completely broken. I??ve spent plenty of holidays sitting alone in my apartment crying. That time of year Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve is coming up again and wondered if anyone else experiences the same? And does anyone have any advice on making it through the holidays a little easier? Thanks much.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author mentions spending holidays alone due to a broken family, which suggests a lack of social support and connection. the specific mention of crying alone in their apartment highlights feelings of sadness and isolation. the author’s inquiry about whether others experience the same and their request for advice on coping through the holidays further demonstrate a desire for connection and support, which are common in individuals experiencing loneliness. the context of holidays, typically a time for family and togetherness, exacerbates these feelings, making the loneliness more pronounced. overall, the narrative's elements of isolation, emotional distress, and seeking connection are typical indicators of loneliness."
"Friends making plansI was recently in a call with my friends, and they started discussing their plans while I was in the call between them and some other friends, it was really awkward. It just made me a little sad. One of the friends in that call had asked me if I was invited to the other friends birthday celebration. I wasn??t. I have friends, yet I feel so alone.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of isolation despite being in the presence of friends, which is a key indicator of loneliness. the individual's discomfort during the call and their sadness upon realizing they were not invited to the birthday celebration highlight feelings of exclusion and being left out. the fact that the person explicitly states feeling alone despite having friends underscores a deeper emotional disconnection. this emotional state is typical of loneliness, where physical presence of social connections does not translate to a sense of belonging or companionship. the narrative captures the emotional pain of being on the periphery of social interactions, which is a significant marker of loneliness."
"Just need to tell somebodyIt doesn't feel like I've got any friends. I had a girlfriend but that relation ended about a month ago. After moving in together in a new city, away from where I've spent most of my life. A little over two years spent with her and looking back, I mainly stayed with her because she was a safe connection to the world.   


I have friends but none of them write to me. Then again, I dont write to them either.   
I used to have a group of friends but people started to move away, get married, have kids. They are all a lot older than me (I'm 30 and they're about 5-10 years older). I didn't do enough to foster the relationship and as people started to move away, I just lost contact.   
Now I'm in a new city, doing my Ms.C. and so far the only friends I've made are in my muay thai gym. The problem is that when we leave the gym, I dont really speak with them. They've all got their own lives and I dont know what to do in order to make a connection, I not sure if they even want to and I dont feel secure in my ability to gauge it.  
I feel disconnected from the world and I dont really know how to make any meaningful connections. 

I have no NYE plans, even though I asked my friends in my home town if they had room for me but people aren't home or they've got other plans.   
I'm good with women and have been using Tinder to hook up regularly with different women but I dont feel any connection. They're just validation and something to do.   
I miss having friends and having fun. I have nobody to talk to about being sad or lonely or frustrated. It's been like this for ages and I dont feel comfortable talking to the people I know because I dont know if they want to listen.   
I dont want to involve the women I date in my issues. I just wish I had a friend to text and say ""hey, I'm having a shit day, wanna do something?"" - But I dont and I don't know if I ever will.   


I feel like a failure and I feel unhelpable. With COVID lockdowns shutting down the night life, I dont know what to do.   
People dont expect this of me. I used to work as a bartender, I currently work in healthcare and I'm used to talking to people and making them feel at ease. I can usually get anybody to open up about their lives. I just dont feel any connection to them.  
I feel alone surrounded by people and most days I just think about not being here any more. It just seems easier to not be here, atleast there is some certainty in that. 

I have a hard time finding joy in anything. I used to game alot but started prioritizing Uni over that but after the break-up, I had a hard time focusing on studying at home but I couldn't find any pleasure in gaming anymore. Nothing really makes me happy anymore.  
Muay thai is a great passion of mine but ever since moving up the fight team, I just feel useless and talentless. I get my ass kicked in sparring because I'm the newbie and most of them have a lot of fights under their belt.   
It's so demotivational not being able to do anything and I just lose confidence in my ability.   
I already hate myself plenty but atleast I had some confidence in muay thai but that's fading quickly.  


Exams are next month and I'm just apathetic. I normally have extreme anxiety about exams but I'm just so empty inside that I can't even feel that. Some days I'm not even sure I exist to anybody and that's probably the most lonely feeling there is.

I dont know what I'm expecting from this post. I just googled lonely subreddit and here I am.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and disconnection from others. the author expresses feelings of not having any friends and a lack of meaningful connections, despite attempts to engage with others through activities like muay thai and using tinder. the recent breakup and relocation to a new city have exacerbated these feelings, leaving the author without a support system. the author mentions a desire to have someone to talk to about their emotions but feels unable to reach out or foster these connections. the sense of being surrounded by people yet feeling alone is a common indicator of loneliness. the author also describes a lack of joy and motivation in activities that once brought pleasure, such as gaming and studying, which can be signs of depression often linked with loneliness. the narrative highlights a deep-seated belief in being unhelpable and a sense of failure, further underscoring the loneliness and emotional distress experienced by the author."
"My only friends are fictional charactersThis sounds weird, but genuinely right now, and for a while, it feels like the only people I have in my life are fictional characters. 

I'm 19F, and have always been told I'm a likeable, intelligent, fun, ambitious person who would make a great friend. I've been told by the friends I've had in the past that I'm a kind, loving person and always have the best intentions. 

But for the past six years or so, it's seemed like making friends has become extremely difficult. I only have one friend right now, and that relationship is seeming to fade too. I was talking to a guy I was interested in for awhile, the first one after having an abusive relationship a few years ago, but he recently seemed like he came up with an excuse to stop talking to me. It feels like with genuinely everyone I try with I get rejected. 

I have a tendency to become obsessed with media I like , and right now it feels like some characters in a show I like are my only friends. Like I actually have a connection to them and have been there with them throughout their journeys. (I'm aware it's fictional just as an fyi) 


I escape into their world so much it feels like I'm there and a part of their adventures, but when I get out of that mindset and realize I'm as lonely as I am I become very depressed. 

It's as if I lost someone. And I so badly wish they were real and my friends.

Anyone experienced anything similar? Does anyone have any feedback on how to help this?",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. the individual describes a reliance on fictional characters for companionship, indicating a lack of meaningful real-life connections. despite being described by others as likeable and kind, the person has struggled to maintain friendships and feels a sense of rejection from various social interactions. the reference to a fading friendship and a recent romantic disappointment further underscores feelings of abandonment and loneliness. the deep emotional attachment to fictional characters and the subsequent depression upon realizing their fictional nature highlights a coping mechanism for dealing with the absence of real-world relationships. this narrative is characterized by a yearning for genuine human connection and the pain of social isolation, which are classic indicators of loneliness."

I don??t really feel like putting my name here because of privacy but here we go. I??m a 17 year old boy just to let you guys know.
But I??m so lonely and depressed
Throughout my life I??ve always been taught to be nice to other and treat them with respect and others will do the same. I have a good amount of friends but I don??t feel like they are now after I think about it. I have been one of the bigger kids growing up and I??m not in terrible shape but not the best. But anyway these people just call me all these names, and it??s almost everyday. Shrek, ogre, fatass and a lot more are the main ones. It sucks because I give them everything I got. I don??t think they love me as much as I have loved them. I would die for them, but I don??t think they would do the same and that??s what truly hurts. I??m so tired of being nice to these people just to get insulted. They say they??re just joking but they don??t get what it??s doing. It makes me feel so bad about myself. Like I am the problem and if I fix it maybe they will stop. But it??s hard. I try to lost weight but it doesn??t come easy. I just wanna be loved by someone you know? That kinda goes into the loneliness. I just wanna love someone for the rest of my life that loves me for me. It??s so tough to get through the day without thinking badly about myself. I have thought about suicide before but I don??t think I could do that. I thought about calling the suicide prevention hotline but i don??t know. It??s a lot easier to talk about this in person so i apologize for my lackluster writing. Anyway, I also feel like a failure and that I will also be a failure. I??m bored with my life but don??t feel like I will find a purpose. I??ve been called a simp before for just trying to be nice. It??s basically bad to be nice to someone from where I am.

I don??t know what to do can I have some help",1,"the narrative is filled with expressions of deep emotional pain and a sense of isolation. the individual discusses feeling lonely and depressed despite having friends, which suggests that their social connections are not fulfilling or supportive. the use of derogatory names and the individual's perception that their friends do not reciprocate the same level of care are strong indicators of loneliness. the person also mentions a desire for love and acceptance, which highlights a lack of meaningful, affirming relationships. feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of suicide further underscore the severity of their loneliness. the narrative is characterized by a profound sense of being misunderstood and unappreciated, which are common experiences among those who feel lonely."
"Oxytocin spraysI was thinking that most of my problems stem from or are exacerbated by a lack of human connection in my life and by extension, a lack of the hormone, oxytocin. Which has been shown to have all kinds of benefits when it comes to stress reduction and social function. So I've been thinking of just buying an oxytocin nasal spray or something like that. Anyone ever tried them?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a yearning for human connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly mentions that their problems are exacerbated by a lack of human connection, highlighting the social and emotional void in their life. the consideration of using an oxytocin nasal spray to alleviate their feelings underscores their desperation for a solution to their loneliness. oxytocin is known as the ""bonding hormone,"" and its mention here is significant because it points to the author's awareness of the biological underpinnings of social bonding and their attempt to artificially replicate it. the inquiry about others' experiences with oxytocin sprays further suggests a desire for shared experiences and validation from a community, which they currently lack. overall, the narrative encapsulates the struggle of someone who is acutely aware of their loneliness and is actively seeking ways to mitigate its effects."
"How I would like to live in the past once moreSince the beginning of the year, I have tried to do many things such as being able to improve myself, but after a few personal constraints as I stopped losing interest in everything I considered a hobby, I saw the instagram posts of those who called "" friends "", but then I realized that they were only with me for convenience. I know that sometimes I get to be serious and dry at times but sometimes I find it difficult to express myself as well as being able to open up to someone but when I open up to a person, they are the first to hurt me as well as get away with it. The only person who loved me as I was left me a few days ago and I miss her a lot. Sometimes I think about what to do but the anxiety and loneliness reaches such a point that I just want to look at the ceiling and listen to the rain fall. I hate how it is that the great moments I do not appreciate at all and the thoughts like the illusions of finding someone are already null and also that something always goes wrong, I just think what would happen if tomorrow I left this world and the simple fact of to be in a better world than my imagination can recreate, I am agnostic so the truth is I do not believe much in those things besides that I have had problems with my family about it. So the only friends I have is an imaginary friend and a lobster plush that brings back good memories. I could never imagine that I would end up in an endless cycle of pain in which everyone abandons me and the most important ones disappear overnight.

"Void in my chest. TW: Self-HarmI feel empty. This loneliness is consuming me and it literally feels like there is a void in my chest. A part of my heart is missing. I lost a friendship that left me fulfilled. I lost the feelings of closeness, connectedness, and security. I felt understood, cared for, and appreciated. I lost something that was good for my well-being. I feel so devastated. I feel even lonelier after losing that friendship that I have urges to self-harm again. My friend was like a best friend to me, except I only saw it as a close friendship. I'd have these depressive thoughts and it makes me want to beat myself up because it was my fault why I lost that friendship. The loneliness is so painful that I want to self-harm again. Physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain. I miss being able to talk to my friend about the ups and downs of my life. I miss spending time with my friend.

I've somehow slipped through the cracks of life and I am deeply and painfully lonely.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness characterized by the author's contemplation of starting over at a later stage in life, which is often accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and despair. the mention of bachelorhood extending into middle age suggests a prolonged period of solitude and the absence of significant relationships. the phrase ""something is very wrong"" indicates a recognition of an underlying issue, and the sentiment that it feels ""too late to fix"" exacerbates the sense of helplessness. the absence of a social circle further isolates the individual, highlighting a lack of social support which is a critical factor in experiences of loneliness. the author's admission of having ""slipped through the cracks of life"" conveys a sense of being overlooked or forgotten, intensifying their feelings of isolation. these elements collectively point to a profound experience of loneliness, marked by emotional pain and a perceived inability to change their circumstances."
I miss having a close knit girl group rather than having a boyfriendAs I??m approaching my mid twenties I??ve come to realise that making friends is so hard. Any tips on repairing broken friendships? Have people who had a fling out with friends managed to repair the friendship?,1,"the narrative expresses a longing for close social connections and highlights the difficulty in forming new friendships as one grows older. the individual specifically mentions missing a close-knit girl group, indicating a sense of loss and yearning for meaningful relationships. this is a typical indicator of loneliness, as the desire for deeper connections often stems from feelings of isolation. the inquiry about repairing broken friendships further underscores the individual's struggle with maintaining social bonds and the importance they place on these relationships. the mention of having a fling with friends and wondering about the possibility of mending those relationships suggests a sense of regret and a desire to restore lost connections, which are common feelings associated with loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a significant concern with social integration and the emotional impact of lacking close, supportive friendships."

There's probably no point to this, and I'll probably delete this post, but for this moment at least I have to spill my thoughts out.  
I'm fucking dying from loneliness, isolation, and boredom. For context, I do have social anxiety and while that has made me do extreme things at times (literally run out of a gym because they needed a picture of me), I'm basically functional. I'm in grad school and have a job. When I'm in those settings and have something to talk about, I can talk. There's other situations where I'm basically okay, but when it comes to just being conversational with a stranger for no reason, I can't do it.  
Not that any of that even matters. I have tried EVERYTHING I can possibly do on my end of things to make friends and nothing has worked. The key word here is FRIENDS. I've never had much trouble finding a boyfriend (if you're an okay-looking girl and are on Tinder, it's really not hard to find a dude who'll take the time to get to know you because he knows he'll get to smash in the end. Women ignore me though--bisexual/lesbian dating is like pulling teeth. But I digress). Anyway, point is, I have a boyfriend, and we're basically attached at the hip, but it's not enough. He's desperate for friends too, and I want him to have that. We both deserve connections outside of each other. But with the way things are going, we might as well be the last two people on earth surrounded by vaguely people-looking things that sometimes talk to us but never connect with us.   
Before anyone starts hitting me with some advice I've already heard 10 billion times, let me just list everything I've tried to make friends/treat my social anxiety in order to make friends. 

1. tinder
2. bumble
3. okcupid (back in the day when it was cool) 
4. A writing meetup group
5. a social anxiety/depression meetup group (might've worked out but it disbanded after like 2 meetings)
6. my college's lgbt club 
7. my college's vegan club
8. activism
9. volunteer work
10. staying in shape/dressing well/basically looking good so people won't treat me like a goddamn leper 
11. talked to a random person at my college's stupid 'heyday' event
12. going to coffee shops/bars/etc alone and hoping to CHRIST that some person just fucking acknowledges i exist (best result: an old couple felt sorry for me at the bar and talked to me for about five minutes before leaving).
13. meditation 
14. journaling
15. mindfulness
16. religion/spirituality
17. focusing on myself and my hobbies so i dont spiral into this exact mood i'm having right now oh wait too late 
18. four different therapists
19. three different medications 
20. and a partridge in a fucking pear tree  


I hear you asking ""why didn't any of those things work out"". Well, I'm a psych grad so going to therapy is like watching a play except the lights never go down, so you can see all the set pieces moving and all the costume changes. I know what they're going to say to me, and it's all redundant and unhelpful. As for the meds, I don't know, I'm not a med person. They just didn't work.   
The social stuff mainly boils down to living in a shitty fucking Southern state in the year of our lord 2019 where no one looks up from their fucking phones, so even the people who AREN'T socially anxious don't know how to talk to anyone anymore, and even if they did talk to me, we'd have nothing in common because my beliefs are so radically different from everyone else's (except my boyfriend, the ONE person in the world who agrees with me on anything). I definitely don't fit in with the conservative majority, but I don't fit in with the liberals or anyone else either.   
There are SO many things I can't talk about with people or have no interest in talking about. Like I can't talk about politics because of the aforementioned differences in beliefs (and I mean MAJOR differences, and no, I don't want to 'discuss our differences' because I've tried that shit and it just leads to arguments and I know no one's mind is going to change anyway so its a huge headache and waste of time).   
I also can't talk about a lot of innocuous surface-level stuff because quite frankly, I don't CARE about the fucking Office or Game of Thrones or Snapchat or whatever the fuck everyone is so obsessed with. Oh, Just talk about MY interests then? Sure, let me bore you to death with my comparison of three different versions of Victor Hugo's *Notre Dame de Paris*, and ooohhh you're already out the door. Do I have any popular interests? Sure, I'm into *Star Wars*, but probably not the way you're into it. How? Oh, nothing, it's just the sequel trilogy is my favorite and----oh, bad opinion alert, off you go!   


I'm trying to accept that all the love I'll ever have is between me and my partner. I know I'm lucky to even have that, and I shouldn't ask for anything more, but that doesn't stop me from crying at least three times a week because he's busy at work and I'm home alone with nothing to do and no one to see and nothing else to live for. I'm really not looking for advice here, because I seriously don't think there's anything left for me to try. I just wanted to spill my guts into the void and be angry and lame and feel sorry for myself, I guess. Whatever. You can make fun of me if you want or tell me I'm being ""negative"". Have at it. I don't care.   


Sorry you had to read this, if you made it this far. Hope your life is going better than mine, that you have popular interests, popular opinions, and live somewhere cool where things happen and people aren't all carbon copies of each other constantly chanting ""it gets better"" with no proof that it actually does.   


Peace.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and desperation for human connection. the author expresses feeling trapped in loneliness despite numerous attempts to forge friendships and seek help. their social anxiety exacerbates the situation, making casual interactions challenging. the detailed recounting of various unsuccessful efforts to connect with others highlights their frustration and sense of futility. the comparison of their relationship with their boyfriend to being the last two people on earth underscores the depth of their isolation. the author’s disdain for superficial conversations and the inability to find common ground with others further alienates them. their emotional distress is evident in their frequent crying and the resignation that their relationship with their partner might be the only significant connection they will ever have. overall, the narrative is a vivid portrayal of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness, struggling to find a way out."
"Haven't had anyone in a while, looking to talk and meet others. (17)Hi, I was hoping to meet someone since I've been lonely. Anyways I'm 17 almost 18 and live in the US. I mostly enjoy games, youtube, politics and circuitry. Other interests you have are fine but I prefer 14-19. If  you want to talk send a message. Even though you only care about females but whatever.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness, starting with the explicit statement of having been lonely and looking to meet others. the author expresses a clear desire for social connection and interaction, which is a common characteristic of individuals experiencing loneliness. the mention of specific interests such as games, youtube, politics, and circuitry suggests an attempt to find common ground with potential friends, indicating a proactive effort to alleviate their loneliness. the age preference of 14-19 further highlights a desire to connect with peers within a similar age group, potentially to share experiences and interests. the casual tone and openness to communication also underscore a yearning for companionship and social engagement. overall, the narrative's emphasis on seeking interaction and the explicit mention of loneliness are strong indicators of the author's current emotional state."
Feeling isolatedCould use someone to talk to on a daily bases.,1,"the narrative suggests a strong sense of isolation and a desire for daily interaction, which are key indicators of loneliness. the use of the word ""isolated"" directly points to a feeling of being separated from others, which is a common experience among lonely individuals. additionally, the phrase ""could use someone to talk to on a daily basis"" highlights a need for consistent social connection and support, something that is often lacking in the lives of those who feel lonely. the longing for regular communication indicates a gap in the person's social interactions, further emphasizing their sense of loneliness. these elements combined provide clear evidence of the individual's emotional state and the underlying loneliness they are experiencing."
"21f. Trying to cope and be okay with being alone, but I don??t feel like I??m winning that battle right nowI??ve always been quiet and extroverted. I went through a horrible breakup not too long ago, and I used to have a best friend that I??ve been friends with since childhood and when I never expected it she ghosted me a few months back. I thought of her like family. It was so much loss in a short span of time. 

I feel so depressed. I??m trying to get back into therapy, I feel so alone. But I don??t want to need someone to feel okay, I want to feel fine alone. But I have no idea how to do it. It hurts so fucking bad. I??m scared",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain. the individual describes recent experiences of significant loss, including a painful breakup and the sudden disappearance of a long-time friend. these events have compounded their feelings of depression and loneliness. the person expresses a struggle with being alone and a desire to find contentment in solitude, but they acknowledge their difficulty in achieving this. the use of strong emotional language and the admission of fear and hurt highlight their current emotional state. seeking therapy indicates an awareness of their need for support, which is a positive step, yet it also underscores their current struggle with loneliness and the need for external help to cope."
I Have Never Felt So Alone[removed],1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation, as evidenced by the phrase ""i have never felt so alone."" this statement is a direct and unequivocal expression of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often articulate their feelings of being disconnected or unsupported, and this narrative is a clear example of such expression. the use of the word ""never"" emphasizes the depth and intensity of the person's emotional state, suggesting that their current experience of loneliness is unparalleled in their life. psychological insights into loneliness highlight that such strong declarations of solitude are typical indicators of a significant emotional and social void. this void can be due to a lack of meaningful relationships, social support, or a sense of belonging. the narrative's brevity and directness further underscore the immediacy and severity of the loneliness being experienced."
"I??m so tired of being aloneI used to have no friends, now I have some, but they don??t like me. They just use me until someone better comes. I guess I??m just unlikable. Social anxiety makes it even worse. I hate to admit it, but I??m really bad at socializing too. I??m exhausted, upset, and bored. It??s what I feel like almost every weekday. I wish I had at least one bff that we stick together no matter what. I wish I could make friends. This summer, I know I??ll be alone like always. I??ll just be waiting in my house, waiting for tomorrow to come, then the next day and the next day and so on, until I have to go be lonely in public again.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. the author describes a history of having no friends and currently having friends who do not genuinely care for them, which suggests a lack of meaningful connections. the mention of being used by friends until someone better comes along indicates feelings of worthlessness and expendability. the author’s acknowledgment of social anxiety and poor social skills further exacerbates their sense of loneliness, as these issues hinder their ability to form and maintain relationships. the repetitive cycle of feeling exhausted, upset, and bored, especially on weekdays, highlights a persistent state of unhappiness and disconnection. the longing for a best friend to share an unwavering bond with underscores a deep desire for companionship and support. the anticipation of a lonely summer and the monotonous wait for each day to pass reflect a bleak outlook on the future and a sense of hopelessness. these elements collectively illustrate the author’s experience of loneliness and the significant impact it has on their emotional well-being."
"What did I do?So back in October I decided to take a break from alcohol.  Major binge drinker here.  I'm super proud of myself for sticking with it but some things that have happened because of quitting have me super sad and depressed.  I feel like all my friends have stopped talking to me.  No one invites me places and I CAN be around people drinking and have just as much fun.  Found out yesterday that a bunch of people I hung around went camping and I wasn't invited.  Maybe I wasn't as well liked as I thought.  Or maybe it has nothing to do with me but damn I feel like my heart is broken.  

I've always struggled with friendships.  I've got alot of anxiety and I don't process emotions very well.  Mine and other people's.  Any advice?  I'm not going to drink just to keep fun friends.  I'll hang with myself and my boyfriend if that's the case.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness, primarily through the individual's experiences and emotions following their decision to quit drinking. the writer expresses a profound sense of sadness and depression, particularly because they feel abandoned by their friends. the absence of invitations and the discovery that their friends went camping without them contribute to feelings of rejection and isolation. the narrative also touches on a long-standing struggle with friendships and social anxiety, which exacerbates their sense of loneliness. the mention of feeling heartbroken and questioning their likability further underscores their emotional distress. these elements collectively illustrate the writer's profound sense of loneliness and their difficulty in processing and navigating social relationships."
"I'm 27 and haven't ever had a steady girlfriendRidiculed by so called friends in school, but was too oblivious to realise it at the time. When I did realise, tried to shed the people pleasing attitude. So dived into drugs and didn't care about much else. I've been with some amazing women, dates, hookups here and there but nobody really cared about me and that really hurt. 

I dont matter to any girl in my life, I'm always the one chasing. I match with women on dating apps but it the excitement fades away soon. It's as if they realise how much of a boring loser I am just from 3-4 text exchanges. 

Most of my male friends only meet to drink and smoke, and I've been drifting away because I'm trying to cut down personally. So there's that.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from meaningful relationships, both romantic and platonic. the individual mentions a lack of steady romantic relationships despite various attempts, highlighting a pattern of unfulfilling connections that leave them feeling uncared for and insignificant. the description of being ridiculed by peers in school and the subsequent shift to drug use suggests a history of coping mechanisms that may have exacerbated feelings of loneliness. the pattern of short-lived excitement in dating and the perception of being a ""boring loser"" further underscores a sense of inadequacy and self-doubt. additionally, the drifting away from male friends due to changes in lifestyle choices indicates a growing sense of alienation and the struggle to find a supportive social network. these elements collectively illustrate a narrative characterized by persistent loneliness and a yearning for genuine connection."
I miss my ex in moments like thisI??m watching Tom Segura stand up. He has this bit about his friend wanting to blow someone in WuTang. My ex would??ve loved this. Watching stand-up alone is definitely more comfortable but also super lonely. I want someone to laugh with,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of longing and emotional void, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author reminisces about their ex and how they would have enjoyed watching the stand-up comedy together, highlighting a specific moment that triggers memories of companionship. the statement ""watching stand-up alone is definitely more comfortable but also super lonely"" underscores the author's awareness of their solitude and desire for shared experiences. the need for someone to laugh with is a poignant expression of the human need for connection and social interaction, reinforcing the presence of loneliness in their current state."
"Pathetic People PleaserI learned something today. I thought I was a good person deserving of love, and now I wonder if I even know what that is. I was a dutiful daughter, faithful wife, loving mother, and hard worker, and I might be these things, but I??m alone. 

I??ve always taken care of my parents. My husband is avoidant and our love is ritual, not felt, and I can??t help but dream about real love through stupid Limerence. I??m often away from my kids, and they are almost full grown. I suck at my jobs, definitely not a work smarter type of person. Might be too smart to see the simple solution.  I have much to be grateful for, and this helps to find possibility, but I feel like I will always be a burden. 

I work so hard to please others that I lost myself, and I realized no one could really love me since in a lot of ways, I don??t love or care for myself. I denied it when people brought it up, and people try to be kind to me since I??m nice, but at a point, I can??t be helped. 

You can care so much for others, be so cable of loving and wanting to see them happy, the worst feeling in the world is realizing they might be happier without you. It??s a paradox. You can??t be full of love and not love yourself, because then you can??t really love others if you don??t love yourself, because deep down, they always know.

This is my loneliness. 

I deserve to be alone. 

I won??t give up, but maybe the acceptance of this will help me move forward.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness and self-doubt. the author reflects on their roles as a daughter, wife, mother, and worker, feeling unfulfilled and disconnected in each. they express a longing for genuine love, lamenting that their relationship with their husband is more ritualistic than heartfelt. the author acknowledges being physically distant from their children and feels inadequate at work. despite recognizing things to be grateful for, they are overwhelmed by a pervasive sense of being a burden and a failure. the narrative highlights a critical insight: the author's struggle with self-love, which they believe undermines their ability to truly love others. this internal conflict and the belief that others might be happier without them are strong indicators of loneliness. the author's acceptance of their loneliness and the hope that it might help them move forward further underscores their isolated state."
"Lonely in the evenings, advice needed pleaseI can make it through the day but come the evening I feel really lonely and anxious. I've found not having anyone to talk to quite difficult, but I'm finding a lack of intimacy as a result of the UK lockdown especially difficult (my love language is touch).

My girlfriend has asked we go on a break because things are so difficult at the moment, and I have no family to talk to because they are so toxic (I've had to fight to not fall back on them because of how detrimental to my mental health it will be). My few friends are with family so are unavailable to talk to, and obviously they can't help with the intimacy issue.

Could you please make suggestions and help me work out what I can do in the evenings (on my own preferably) to keep myself from feeling so lonely, anxious, and low?

Thanks for any help you can provide",1,"the narrative describes feelings of loneliness and anxiety that intensify in the evenings. the author expresses difficulty due to a lack of social interaction and intimacy, particularly during the uk lockdown. the mention of their love language being touch highlights the impact of physical isolation on their emotional well-being. the situation is further compounded by a recent break from their girlfriend and the absence of supportive family members, who are described as toxic and detrimental to their mental health. the author also notes that their few friends are unavailable, leaving them without a support system. the plea for suggestions to alleviate loneliness and anxiety in the evenings indicates a deep sense of isolation and a struggle to cope with these emotions alone. these aspects collectively underscore the author's experience of loneliness."
"Everyone feels lonely for different reasons but at the center of it I think there's a lack of opportunitiesI can't speak for everyone but I personally feel lonely because I'm never invited anywhere. I feel more and more isolated by the day and it's bordering on not having anyone TO invite me anyplace. It becomes sort of this domino effect because when this happens you get further and further from socializing and closer to isolation. 
I'm not socially awkward but I firmly believe loneliness is totally avoidable if everyone were just given a chance. 
Imagine a party for just lonely people? Regardless of age, gender, cultural differences, etc. I think if we got all the folks in here into one room we'd be able to come together as a team and have a great time making lasting relationships. Intellectual conversation. Camaraderie. Laughs. Potential love interest. All the stuff that makes life worth living that we've unfortunately lost sight of.
The problem is we don't have the opportunity to make those choices. Everything feels so limited. It's truly heartbreaking.

It's neither here nor there but if I ever hit the lottery and become rich or something I'd gladly host something like this and invite everyone. I promise I'm not as boring as I seem and could definitely make things interesting :D",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and yearning for social connection. the author expresses a personal experience of not being invited to social events, which contributes to feelings of loneliness and further isolation. the description of a ""domino effect"" highlights how the lack of social opportunities can lead to a cycle of increasing loneliness. the author's wish for a party for lonely people suggests a strong desire for community and meaningful relationships. the narrative also touches on broader themes such as the importance of inclusivity and the impact of social opportunities on mental well-being. the overall tone conveys a sense of heartbreak and frustration over limited opportunities for social interaction, which are common indicators of loneliness."
Feeling like a liabilityI??m cool with a few people at work and they always go out together who are all older than me (19F). They always like we don??t invite you out because I don??t want to be responsible if something happens to you. Idk if it??s just me but that doesn??t make me feel good and it really bothers me. ,1,"the narrative reveals feelings of exclusion and perceived rejection, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the individual describes being left out of social activities by colleagues, which can contribute to a sense of isolation. the specific mention of feeling like a liability and the discomfort it causes highlights an internal struggle with self-worth and belonging. the person's age and the fact that they are younger than their coworkers may exacerbate these feelings, as they might perceive a gap or barrier to forming deeper connections. the repeated instances of not being invited and the emotional impact it has on the individual suggest an ongoing experience of loneliness, where social needs are unmet, and there is a longing for inclusion and acceptance."

"What makes some women attracted to lonely and isolated guys?I??ve always been very lonely and isolated and there have been at least four occasions where the attractive girl made the first move, like in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. but my self-loathing and mother complex always got in the way of following up with these girls.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation, as explicitly stated by the individual. the mention of being ""very lonely and isolated"" is a direct indicator of their emotional state. the individual also highlights past experiences where attractive women showed interest, yet they were unable to pursue these connections due to ""self-loathing and mother complex."" this suggests a struggle with self-worth and psychological barriers that prevent forming meaningful relationships. such internal conflicts are common in individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often deal with negative self-perceptions and unresolved personal issues. the reference to a specific film, ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,"" might indicate a longing for connection and understanding, further emphasizing their emotional struggles. overall, the narrative contains clear signs of loneliness, including self-imposed isolation, negative self-image, and difficulties in forming intimate relationships."

Bye.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and disconnection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions a lack of friends and the loss of connections during a difficult period in their life, specifically when their mother was sick. this disruption in their social network was compounded by their subsequent moves, first from their hometown and then abroad, which further severed any remaining ties. upon returning, they found themselves without anyone to rely on, highlighting the enduring impact of these changes. the reference to social anxiety exacerbates their difficulty in forming new relationships, particularly in their thirties, an age where social circles often become more established and harder to penetrate. the mention of feeling like disappearing and the bleak outlook on life underscore the depth of their loneliness. the final wish for the reader to have a better weekend contrasts starkly with their own despair, emphasizing their sense of isolation and longing for connection. these elements collectively paint a vivid picture of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness."
Anyone here wants to chat with lonely female?Anyone lonely wants to simply chat with bbw. Send DMs or request chat.,1,"the narrative reflects a clear desire for connection and interaction, which are common indicators of loneliness. the repeated use of the word ""lonely"" and the direct appeal for someone to chat with suggest a sense of isolation and a need for social engagement. the author is explicitly seeking companionship and reaching out to others in hopes of finding someone who can relate to their feelings of loneliness. this behavior is typical of individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often actively look for ways to alleviate their sense of solitude by attempting to form new social bonds or revive existing ones. the emphasis on wanting to chat and the specific invitation for others to send direct messages or requests further highlight the author's yearning for meaningful interaction and emotional connection."

"I keep hearing that it??ll get better, but it only ever seems to get worse.It seems to be impossible for me to add people into my life.

I noticed around two or three years ago that my circle was getting smaller and smaller, and I figured that had to be my fault somehow. I decided to make changes. I made changes to my attitude to be a more positive and likable person, I made changes to the way I spoke to sound like less of an asshole, I made changes to my lifestyle to be healthier, the list goes on... And nothing has changed. Nothing has changed in the slightest, my circle has gotten so small that it now barely includes my immediate family.

As I just said, I try my hardest to always stay positive and be somebody that people want to be around. It??s getting exhausting. It??s getting exhausting, and I have nothing to show for it. I have so few opportunities to actually make friends and get dates. Every chance I get, I always knock it out of the park. I don??t think there??s a single person that??s talked to me for more than 10 minutes that doesn??t like me. I always hear that it??s not me, it??s everyone else. That sounds so arrogant to me. I have to be the problem. I??m the one that always ends up alone, not everyone else.

But if I am the problem, what about me is the problem? Like I said, I??ve been constantly trying to improve myself wherever I can. I feel like I??m currently 10 times the man I was this time last year, yet I feel even more lonely than I was back then. I don??t know how much longer I can keep this up. I just want to have someone in my life that will tell me I??m doing a good job. I hope I get it someday, but it doesn??t appear to be anytime soon.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of despair and frustration stemming from persistent social isolation. the individual describes a consistent pattern of failed attempts to form and maintain meaningful relationships, despite considerable efforts to improve their personal qualities and social skills. the mention of a shrinking social circle, which now barely includes immediate family, underscores the depth of their isolation. the person's reflection on their efforts to stay positive and likable, juxtaposed with the exhaustion and lack of tangible results, highlights the emotional toll of their loneliness. their self-doubt and internalized blame, questioning what about them might be the problem, further indicate a deep-seated sense of inadequacy and loneliness. the longing for validation and companionship, coupled with the recognition that such connections seem unattainable in the near future, encapsulates the core experience of loneliness."
"My BFFs are way better than meFor a bit of context, I have 2 bffs, that are literally my rock. Ive known them for almost 10 years and we been best friends since then. 

The thing is, they are beautiful and have had between 3 and 5 relationships, some really serious. They always have multiple guys in their DMs and just crushing on them. And me? Im a 21 yo weird penguin who is just ""the ugly friend"". Ive never had a relationship, never have guys wanting me... 

For example, Im in several classes with one of them. We basically are a pair, we spend the breaks together (with other people ofc) and everyone knows we are besties. And still, in every single class we have, there is a guy who starts following her on instagram and texts her and no one ever does it to me. 

They are always talking about guys and their exes and their sex lives (which is normal for 21 yo girls) and I always feel very left out, because I can only say ""yes, remember when I made out with that random foreigner once"" and literally have nothing more to say. 

Ofc I dont want them to talk about their things, but its just so frustrating to know Im worse then them and that everyone will forever compare the three of us and I will loose in every single thing.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of inadequacy and social comparison, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual describes feeling overshadowed by their best friends, who they perceive as more attractive and socially successful. this persistent comparison and the feeling of being ""the ugly friend"" suggest a lack of self-worth and social belonging. the writer's recounting of their friends' romantic successes and their own lack of romantic attention further highlights feelings of exclusion and isolation. the frustration and resignation expressed in the narrative, particularly in the context of social interactions and relationships, underscore a sense of being left out and not measuring up to their peers. these emotions are typical of someone experiencing loneliness, as they feel disconnected from the social and emotional experiences that their friends are having."
"finally a bit brighter and yet still just a shade of greyI'm feeling ok, finally found my motivation to live, started working out again with awesome results, and even discovered a way to sooth my loneliness when it really gets to me, still miss that feeling of happiness and not being alone, the warmth, the care,the attention, everything is ok but ain't good thankfully it's not bad but it's still grey, one day I will find my true sun or I will die trying, the sun that will wash away the greynes and will make me feel something once again, the sun that will warm my soul and heal my loneliness",1,"the narrative expresses a sense of persistent loneliness despite some positive changes in the author's life. the mention of finding motivation to live and working out with good results indicates some level of self-improvement and effort to combat negative feelings. however, the recurring theme of loneliness is evident as the author explicitly mentions soothing their loneliness and missing feelings of happiness, warmth, care, and attention. the description of life being ""a shade of grey"" and the yearning for a ""true sun"" to wash away the greyness and heal their loneliness highlights a deep-seated sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect an ongoing struggle with feeling alone and a desire for emotional fulfillment and companionship."
"Stuck I'm my own head.A part of being lonely  is not having anyone to share with. There are good and bad things happening in my life that I wish I could talk about. But instead it feels insignificant, just thoughts, as though none of it is real.

I keep wishing that somebody would notice and save me somehow. But I dont want to be pitied, i want to fix this myself; eventually.

I just wanted to share. It's not just in my head anymore now.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and the desire for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author mentions being stuck in their own head, which suggests an overwhelming internal dialogue without external outlets. the longing to share both good and bad experiences but feeling that they are insignificant points to a lack of validation and social interaction. the wish for someone to notice and save them indicates a craving for acknowledgment and support, while the rejection of pity and the desire to fix things themselves reveal a struggle with vulnerability and self-reliance. these elements collectively highlight the emotional turmoil and the sense of disconnection that are characteristic of loneliness."
"I feel like I've missed out on too much already19m here. I'm relieved I managed to find a place to vent on reddit, and that there are more people like me, selfish as that is. I just finished my first year of college and it was probably the most lonely year of my entire life. I was able to make at least a few friends, but pretty much all of them have other main friend groups that I'm not a part of and I feel like I'm just a peripheral character in everybody else's life. I told myself that I would just have to take the time to adjust to college life, but most of it consisted of sitting in my dorm room alone. I was unwell both physically and mentally and was just so depressed that I seemed to have been barred access to the kind of rosy college life that everybody around me was able to enjoy effortlessly. I just recently made the decision to go back to school in-person instead of staying at home, but some days I just get that sinking feeling in my stomach and regret that feeling so much. I wanted to come back to get another change at making friends but I'm scared that I'm just making the same mistake I made when I decided to come to this out of state school in the first place and I'll be just as miserable as I was in my first year, or even more so, given the quarantine procedures and how hard it'll be to make friends and meet people because of that. I never really learned how to make friends growing up, I always just had one close friend throughout all of elementary middle and high school and I just became friends with his friends instead of making my own. Now that I'm back home and quarantining, I think they are all hanging out without me, I see them playing together on steam all the time and so it looks like they went and made a new discord server without me as well because the one that I'm on has been inactive since march. I always thought that no matter what happened when I was away at college I would always have them to come back to at home, but oh well. I knew that I'd manage to push them away eventually, it just took a longer time than usual. All of my friends that I made throughout my childhood are now either out of my life or leaving it rapidly. Some of my closest childhood friends I haven't talked to in 5 or 6 years. All the friends I initially thought I'd made at college also started to exclude me even in the first week, I thought I was part of their group but they just split off and left me alone.

I feel like something inside me just broke since I left high school and made it impossible for me to truly connect with any other person, I feel like there's just something fundamentally wrong with me sometimes and that's why everybody I see is able to just easily make friends with everybody else, but when they talk to me they can see the brokenness, they can see that I'm less trustworthy, or that I'm just a shitty person, subconsciously, and they avoid me as a result. I don't know why I ever left my home, I should have just gone to my state's university like everybody close to me did. I even had to break up with my hs girlfriend when I left to go to college out of state and she's ghosting me now too. I don't know how to wrap this up, but I just wish I could be normal. I wish people treated me like they treat everyone else instead of acting so guarded and wary. I don't even think I'm that unattractive, it's just purely my vibes I guess. I wish I was approachable. I wish I could have a normal life, and if that means mediocrity or averageness then I'd fully embrace it just so I could be like everybody else instead of having to feel like such a freak all the time. Maybe I'm over dramatizing everything, maybe I made my problems sound worse than they really are. I just don't know. I hope I can figure out how to fix my life before it's too late, I want to spend these years making memories, but I'm not, and that just means that I'm making regrets instead. What I'm most terrified of is looking back on these years when I'm 40 or 50 and realizing that it only ever got harder, so I should have seized these years when I had the opportunity instead of spending them all depressed and lonely, but I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get out of this. I just hope it gets better. I don't want life to stay the same.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and disconnection, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the author mentions feeling like a peripheral character in the lives of others, highlighting a lack of meaningful connections. despite making a few friends, they feel excluded from main social groups, exacerbating their sense of isolation. the experience of sitting alone in a dorm room, feeling physically and mentally unwell, and observing others effortlessly enjoying college life further underscores their loneliness. the regret and fear of repeating past mistakes by returning to school in-person, combined with the difficulty of making friends due to quarantine procedures, amplify their sense of hopelessness. the author also reflects on their inability to make friends throughout their life, relying on one close friend and feeling left out now that they are back home. the narrative is filled with self-doubt and a belief that something is fundamentally wrong with them, leading to a perception that others can sense their brokenness and avoid them. this internalized negativity and the longing to be normal and approachable are strong indicators of loneliness. the fear of looking back on life with regret and the desire to make meaningful memories further highlight their deep-seated loneliness and desire for connection. overall, the narrative vividly illustrates the author's pervasive sense of loneliness and the psychological distress it causes."
I feel like I??m in purgatory.I??m literally trapped inside of my mind all day. No one really understands. I reach out for help and people treat me like i??m asking for too much.

"No friends.I'm a 27 yo male from the UK... I've tried making mates to play xbox with (red dead redemption, dead by daylight etc) and sure I've had people add me but no one will actually play anything. I've tried making friends irl as well to the same effect. I do have 1 friend who I see once or twice a year and have a FWB but aside from the sex he doesn't really care to much to chat or hang out... Just want to have a connection with someone, doesn't have to be romantic just someone I can mess around and have fun with... I really enjoy being silly when I play online games so if we do that then be willing to accept a crazy personality, I literally call random players on rdr ""Blueberries"" coz of their markers on the map and I can get a little odd at time.

"Does anyone else feel like they dont know how to Express themselves when talking leading to just being frustrated and drained from it.I'm starting to notice that one reason why I'm feeling lonely is because whenever I do talk to my friends I'm used to having this sarcastic aggressive tone when talking and I'm starting to realize when talking without that tone I'm usually at a loss of words and dont know really how to talk about something without feeling like I'm  hitting a wall leading to me just being quiet and not talking at all.

"'It's important to be able to develop relationships'That's what a counselor I was working with was saying. Despite being in college surrounded by people for 3.5 years, and working with several therapists I made almost no connections at a big school, and it's caused many problems. Forget even having a social life, but no one for support, my parents are falling out of my life so when I depended on them more a year ago that wasn't too good. It's really sad actually, I let all the connections just go away. Even today knowing that I still can't put a foot forward, I just live in frustration. There's no way someone can know me, no one knew me, being alone was the only thing I felt like was myself. But it's not right if you want to function in this world. It's caused a lot of issues, I feel like people use me or I offend them and despite having a good degree I can't even get a job in the right place. I lost everything because of  this problem and I thought I was working on it but I guess I'm still too scared or too reluctant to actually change. It may not be my fault but it is my responsibility. Nobody chooses this but the only way to move forward is to take responsibility. I went to this great, top school with a great degree and no ones going to show up at my graduation. All those hours I spent trying to get employed and I still don't have something to look forward to. My grades plummeted last month but I wasn't partying; I have a top degree but no job; I sought professional help over the last 1.5 years and the root didn't change.

"Advice for Loneliness(duh)(16F) I know what I know and any solutions to my loneliness are only futile.

I listen to some of the things my bestfriend  says and compare it to me, and it??s saddening. For example, earlier this month I caught COVID, no one checked on me except my dad, his wife, and my bestfriend. Today my bestfriend missed school because she feels sick, and she told me how people won??t stop txting and asking her if she??s ok. She told me and someone else she was sick (2 ppl), yet everyone else found out??but when I was sick and I told people no one cared or checked up up on me.

My bestfriend says it??s because ??I??m not social enough,?? but here??s what I find funny about that.

Sorry for all the bad spelling and stuff.",1,"the narrative reveals profound feelings of isolation and sadness, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a lack of social connections, noting the absence of friends and feeling like an outcast within their own family. this sense of not belonging is compounded by their dog's indifference, which contrasts with common anecdotes of pets providing comfort. the person's self-deprecating apology for their spelling mistakes further suggests low self-esteem and a desire for validation. the mention of wanting to escape existence, even without suicidal intent, underscores a deep sense of despair and emotional pain. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."
"Recent Breakup, Quarantine, and No Friends or Family NearbyMy boyfriend and I just broke up and it's really fucking with me. We weren't together very long (5 months) but we were very into each other at the beginning. Quarantine came and we realized during it we were different people, and we didn't make sense. So we mutually decided, this doesn't work, we have to break up, we are not happy around each other.

That was last week. I spent the week reading books, speaking virtually to friends, doing meditation, reading Reddit to help with breakup pain. I was feeling really confident and ok with the decision and what we had to do. It made sense.

He came over and we exchanged stuff, and then he stayed and talked. We had a really honest and good conversation. I wish he had communicated like that while we were together. It doesn't change that we are different people, but I finally felt like I was seeing the vulnerability that had gone missing for the past 6 weeks. It made me feel close to him. We left it on good terms, he left, and I completely broke down. 

He has always lived in this town, so he has friends he can distract himself with. He has a car and can drive anywhere. It's his town - so there is comfortability there. I moved here for a job 2 years ago and don't know anyone outside of work, and I can't see anyone from there anyways bc of quarantine, plus as management, I don't think I should really be socializing with them (and cannot create friendships). Prior to quarantine I worked such insane hours there wasn't a chance to meet new people. I have a weird schedule and weird days off, and it makes it difficult to socialize at normal times. Plus work is really exhausting so I usually spend my first day off sleeping just to recuperate. 

After my ex left I realized I am SO alone here. My parents are on the other side of the country, my friends are spread around but no one is here. I literally do not have a single person to call and speak to here. To even see in person when restrictions are lifted. I watched the sunset to remind myself to put things in perspective, and it was so beautiful. And there wasn't anyone I could text that to. My friends have kids and are busy - no one has time to respond or share in the moment.

One of the meditations I did earlier this week was like, talk to your significant other, spend time with the family in your house to reduce anxiety! And I thought - but I am literally and completely alone. Hug who? Talk to who? Play a card game with who?

I am just feeling super low. I couldn't stop crying after he left realizing he goes back to a full social life in his town, and I go back to... nothing. There is not a soul in this town I can hangout with or call. And the aching loneliness is incredibly soul crushing. It starts to feel like I'm watching life pass me by, and watching people go on walks with their significant other, or riding bikes with their kids... and I'm sitting here alone with not a person on the horizon.

I don't know how to manage the despair of the loneliness.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress following a breakup during quarantine. the author describes feeling disconnected and unsupported, with no friends or family nearby. the breakup exacerbates feelings of loneliness, as the author realizes the lack of social connections in their current town. the quarantine further limits opportunities for social interaction, intensifying the sense of being alone. the author’s reflections on their ex-partner’s social life highlight a stark contrast to their own situation, increasing feelings of despair and loneliness. specific examples, such as the inability to share a beautiful sunset with someone or the meditation exercise emphasizing family connections, underscore the profound isolation experienced. the emotional breakdown after the ex-partner’s departure and the subsequent realization of having no one to turn to are clear indicators of loneliness. the narrative vividly captures the psychological impact of isolation, making the loneliness palpable and deeply felt."
"Totally alone?? have just a friend actually but hes in another country and i have no one to hang out or speak about anything.I go for walks everyday,i workout 5 days every week.Im 20 and i have nothing for living,i have no job,my parents are not so friendly with me.Im just looking to walls and crying or sleeping.Video games,animes or anything else don't give fun anymore.I think about suicide for days.I don't know what to do with life,just pathetic.",1,"the narrative reflects several classic indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly states feeling ""totally alone"" and mentions having only one friend who is geographically distant, which underscores a lack of immediate social support. the person describes a routine of walking and working out, which can be seen as attempts to fill time or distract from their feelings of isolation. their age, 20, is also a critical period where social connections are particularly important for emotional development. the lack of a job and unfriendly relationship with parents further exacerbate their sense of isolation and lack of purpose. the mention of crying, looking at walls, and losing interest in previously enjoyable activities like video games and anime are signs of deep emotional distress. thoughts of suicide indicate severe loneliness and possibly depression, highlighting the urgent need for support and intervention."
"16f lost all my friends and feeling super isolatedi've lost all my friends due to multiple serious fights and drama that i got dragged into the middle of. i have no one to talk to because i don't know anyone at my school and my teachers all hate me. summer's coming up and i feel so alone and i dont know how i'm going to go through this, if someone could talk to me it'd be so appreciated... under 18 please",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and loneliness, characterized by the loss of all friends due to serious conflicts and drama. the writer expresses a lack of social connections, indicating that they have no one to talk to and feel alienated at school, where they perceive their teachers as hating them. the upcoming summer, typically a time for social activities and bonding, is instead a source of anxiety and dread for the writer, further emphasizing their isolation. the plea for someone to talk to, specifically someone under 18, underscores their desperation for companionship and support from peers. these elements are clear indicators of loneliness, as the individual is experiencing significant social disconnection and emotional distress."
This quarantine is going to be the end of meIve never felt so lonely in my life. I have no one messaging me I have no one trying to reach out to me. I'm being left on read. My depression is spiraling because I'm so stressed about money and my job with the Corona virus going on. I honestly just want to end it all. I'm tired of feeling like this,1,"the narrative expresses profound feelings of isolation and despair, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly states that they have never felt so lonely in their life and highlights the lack of communication from others, as no one is messaging or reaching out to them. being left on read further emphasizes the sense of neglect and abandonment. the mention of depression spiraling due to stress about money and job security during the pandemic underscores the overwhelming emotional burden they are carrying. the desire to end it all signifies a critical level of hopelessness and emotional pain, which are often intertwined with severe loneliness. the combination of these elements paints a clear picture of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness, struggling to cope with their circumstances."
"I am alone feeling like screwed up !So its gonna be a long text get set for a ride .I was never the social type of person but i would always had people close to me to hang around and do stuff .From when i was in the age of 12 i would always had a best friend to do literally everything with him .As i was growing up,i kept losing all of my close friends due to their parents job cause they had to transfer to another town ,etc...around highschool after another close friend has  left and basically changed city(living in an island so basically leaving the island its pretty hard to keep in touch with other)i met another guy who was pretty alone and immediately we created a strong bond .As years passed we he kept being my best friend while for 2 years we stopped chatting cause i got into a group with other friends doing stuff that my best friend didn't like cause he was the type of the housecat person.With my new friends we were keeping strong emotions hanging out all the time and doing stuff .Basically here comes the circle again i made a new best friend and after a year he had to leave the cott and basically change country but we kinda kept on touch through gaming .Reaching the age of 18 ot was the time for me to go to a university. First day and i am literally frozen in motion literally cant talk to anyone .I mean i was expecting that to happen but i thought i would have the willpower to manage and talk to anyone . It turned out that my mentality was too weak and ended up viewing mt first class solo on the back seats of the classroom .I was so nervous that my college life could be a huge mess .Second day as i was sitting and watching the lecture some guy came to talk to me ans we started hanging out .several days in and 2 more guys came and we created a group to sit and chat .We hanged a lot doing stuff outside of the university.Basically after a month from the 4 of us the one guy started dissapearing,the second guy transfered to another university and the third guy just gave up the whole college stuff and left so i was once again alone .Entering the class i caught with my eye another guy sitting a row behind me alone .I found the courage to speak with him and we ended up after some chatting becoming best college friends .that guy introduced me to some of his friends and we created another group .Basically the story begins from here.With one of his friends we became pretty close spending all the day with eachother and doing stuff .For some reason we argued and both of our behaviours started to change .He said some stuff as a joke ,i got really angry and i started fading away.i noticed changes in my behavior like i was keeping a big distance from people .i couldnt laugh that easily anymore and started to loose my cool and became a boring person .Summer came and i met my group of friends from where i was living .We were doing stuff all summer and basically it was one of the best summers in my life.i noticed again due to my behavior like i was kinda left out of the good stuff but i didn't have a problem with that cause i just wanted to hang out with someone .the end of the summer comes and its time for my university to starts again.The point is that my friend has announced me that he will leave college life and just come for a week or two for the exams.Then i fell like the depression was started to hitting on me.I spend a lot of time locked in my house watching movies playing video games and eating.I left myself out of control turned onto an obese person and the problems kept railing up.Going to 1 year ago i decided to send a message to my friend from highschool .he answered and we started talking for days about how messed up both of our lives were and how ruined they were by the circumstances of the enviroment we were in and how we slowly destroyed them .
The summer came and we started hanging around with mt friend more .he was pretty closed to himself so i tried to drag him with the group of friends i had but he wasnt in the mood and i respected that.With that group of people i was started to being left out from stuff more and more .i felt like hell watching them randomly all together while i was alone so we started fading .Now o just have that one friend that we rarely do stuff due to him prefering being at home and me feeling so lonelt .I HAD MORE TO WRITE BUT THE THINGS I WROTE ARE ENOUGH TO SEE MY STORY DONT KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME BUT I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM AND HEAR THEIR STORIES .ALSO SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH THEY ARE MY SECOND LANGUAGE !",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and a recurring pattern of forming and losing close relationships. the individual describes a history of significant friendships that were disrupted by external circumstances, such as friends moving away or changing life paths. these disruptions have led to feelings of abandonment and difficulty in maintaining long-term connections. the person mentions several attempts to rebuild social circles, each ending in disappointment or further isolation. they express feelings of nervousness and inadequacy in social situations, particularly during their university years, which exacerbates their sense of loneliness. the individual's self-awareness of their changing behavior, such as becoming more distant and less able to laugh, further highlights their struggle. their admission of spending extensive time alone, engaging in solitary activities like watching movies and playing video games, and their feelings of being left out by their social groups, are classic indicators of loneliness. the narrative ends with a plea for connection, indicating a strong desire to overcome their loneliness by sharing experiences with others who might understand their plight."
"I have been practically in lockdown since March 2019So, I (17 M) have been practically in lockdown since COVID started spreading worldwide. My family has become very cautious literally with everything and we stay home most of the time. Basically, the only ones that go out are my parents but just if it is extremely necessary. In my own case I??ve gone out less than 10 times maybe (even though I??m already vaccinated, as well as my entire family).

Sometimes I really do feel confused about myself and how I am holding up. After COVID started, my school went online and continued like that for a year, I also went from middle school to high school in this time frame. I just started a new school year two months ago and my school decided to implement a hybrid class system. My family chose online, as well as the majority of other students. However, more people have started to choose going to school (at my school you can decide whether if you are taking online or not each month). Additionally, during the last year or so I have made myself very perfectionist and I must admit I put a lot more effort when it comes to be about school, so it turns into effort and time consuming. Sometimes I have even thought this is my way of coping with the circumstances, and that subconsciously I want to be busy doing something to keep myself away of ??reality??.

Also, I haven??t been able to see any of my friends in ??real-life?? for almost a year and a half, which sometimes makes me feel somewhat lonely and a bit sad. There is also this girl I like a lot, and I think I could even like her. Unfortunately, she moved to a different country than mine, but she may return in a couple of months. The bad thing is that I may not even see her. As mentioned previously my parents are kinda overprotective (of course I really appreciate them caring for my health and well-being), so it is very unlikely that they will let me see basically anyone. There have been lots of occasions in which friends have invited me to hangout and do something, and I really do want to go out with them but I know that my parents will just say no and it is very frustrating. For example, on one occasion one of my closest friends went to study abroad and there was this farewell-party I was invited to, and while mostly everyone was already vaccinated I wasn??t able to attend. 

So, this has been very frustrating for myself and I really feel very lonely deep inside. I??m not the type of person that expresses true feelings frequently and I??m not that emotional as well. Still, I feel desperate, unmotivated and I feel like my life has turned into a boring and monotonous routine(in a sense it has definitely turned like this). I??m afraid that I??ll be having the same reality during 2022. I have 1.5 high school years left and I??m also really afraid I missed out/will miss out all this period of my life.

Edit: Thanks if you took the time to read all of this, I just really wanted to unburden myself.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and frustration, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the author describes being in lockdown for an extended period, significantly limiting their social interactions and experiences. despite being vaccinated, the cautious approach of their family prevents them from engaging in normal social activities, such as attending school in person or meeting friends. the transition from middle school to high school during the pandemic adds to their feelings of disconnection, as they miss out on forming new relationships and maintaining old ones. the author also mentions their coping mechanism of becoming a perfectionist, which can be a way to distract themselves from the reality of their isolation. the unfulfilled desire to see a girl they like, who has moved to another country, further amplifies their sense of longing and loneliness. the frustration of not being able to attend social events, like a friend's farewell party, underscores their feelings of exclusion and sadness. overall, the narrative reveals a profound struggle with loneliness, characterized by a lack of social interaction, unexpressed emotions, and a monotonous routine that leaves the author feeling unmotivated and desperate."
"I'm so fucking lonely I want to dieJust took a Clonazepam trying to numb myself, I can't take this pain, can't keep going, just want to take a blade and cut my skin everywhere and see that red blood and somehow get some fucking release. Idk man

All I need is someone I can talk to and someone who will fucking care about me and I will do the same for them. But, no, everyone ghosts me. I'm tired of this.

i am the silent observer of other peoples lives. i punish myself for trying to get close to anyone, i dont see myself as worthy enough to be in their world. so i observe them from afar and fantasize about me being worthy. 

no matter how illogical, unrealistic our personal fantasies or dreams are, despite all odds, we convince ourselves that we will achieve them one day. that no matter age, cognitive ability, income, people believe in their dreams past their expiration date. this is the essence of the human condition. no matter what you have you will always want more, inexplicable and illogical more. 

brotherhood, human companionship, connection, can only exist through collective suffering. collective suffering is what brings us together, not love. funerals bring us closer together than weddings. the only way we can begin to understand each other is by understanding each other's suffering and where it comes from. 

what am i waiting for? what days do i remember? i spend my life waiting for things to happen, they never do. i spend my life waiting in vain, wasting years for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. and it never comes, so you spend your time in vague regret, or vaguer hope that something good will come along. something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. and the truth is, i feel so angry. the truth is, i feel so fucking sad. i felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long ive been pretending im okay. i dont know why. maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery. because they have their own. 

i fantasize about the flowers growing and what if we owned the garden center what if we all owned it and everyone could be well.",1,"the narrative is a poignant reflection of deep emotional turmoil and a profound sense of isolation. the author grapples with intrusive thoughts about ending things, indicating a severe level of despair. they fantasize about having a girlfriend and being worthy of love and connection, yet immediately dismiss these thoughts as unattainable due to their perceived emotional incapability. this self-punishing mindset and the feeling of unworthiness are strong indicators of loneliness. the author describes themselves as a silent observer, disconnected from the lives of others, which reinforces their isolation. their reflections on human connection being rooted in collective suffering rather than love further highlight their bleak outlook on relationships. the narrative is steeped in feelings of waiting in vain for something or someone to bring meaning and connection to their life, which never materializes, leading to a cycle of regret and unfulfilled hope. the raw expressions of anger, sadness, and prolonged hurt, coupled with the admission of pretending to be okay, underscore the depth of their loneliness and emotional pain."

I have friends but I??ve never felt more sad and alone in my entire life.nan,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of emotional disconnection despite the presence of friends, which is a key indicator of loneliness. the expression of feeling ""sad and alone"" suggests that the individual is experiencing an internal void that social interactions are not fulfilling. this dissonance between having friends and still feeling lonely highlights the difference between social isolation and emotional loneliness. psychological insights suggest that loneliness can stem from a lack of meaningful, deep connections rather than the mere presence of people in one's life. the intensity of the emotions described, such as ""never felt more sad,"" underscores the depth of the individual's loneliness. this aligns with the understanding that loneliness is not just about physical solitude but about the quality of relationships and the subjective experience of being understood and valued."
"I don't know how to deal with thisHello, 25M here; ever since my breakup (nearly 6 months ago) I have been feeling extremely lonely and I still could not open up to another people. I've been working on myself truly, I've lost weight (102 to 83, still losing), focused more on my work / career, changed some of my habits, started doing things I've never had a chance before. I thought the lack of self-confidence I have was about my weight, but it turned out it was not, I am not a type of person who could go to a cafe and see someone who's sitting alone and talk to them, that is not me. Tried online dating apps, getting judged by pictures before you actually get a chance to talk with them, did not work. It is complicated like, I want to find someone, to love and be loved by someone and but in the meantime I do care about my own personal space more than anything. I don't know if I am still dealing with the breakup, if I am still recovering, maybe I am not ready at all, who knows, 6 months is a short amount of time for someone like me. I just don't know how to be happy by myself, I've always searched happiness in other people, that was the most hardest struggle I've had to dealt with, and I am still trying. But simply I do not know how to deal with this loneliness anymore, like I cannot enjoy anything, I am playing games at night after work, does not help, going out on weekends, does not help, spending time with my family, makes me smile for a short time but the thoughts are still there. Not just talking about relationships, I am also lacking ""female"" in my life like,  I studied among men, been working here for nearly 1.5 years, there's no one to meet, having a simple life, work-home-sleep cycle and during covid the situation became worse, online friendships doesn't last long, I don't know why it ends up with one of the sides getting ghosted.

I was doing quite well for a while.  I've relapsed a few times with self-harm but aside from that, I've felt good about life. I don't like hanging out with people all the time and I kinda like quarantine because I have a good excuse to avoid others (self-isolation isn't mandatory where I am). 

I have a boyfriend. I have a good friend group and we're always chatting together. I'm not on my own but I feel like I am. I want to see friends now and then but I'm not allowed to leave the house because I have a lot of schoolwork to catch up on, so I have to rely on social media for interactions. People don't really make an effort to reach out to me specifically, aside from my boyfriend. They address the group chats and I'm included in the conversations but it's not a 1-on-1 deal.

I feel like such a burden and it's affecting me. I'm anxious all the time, at a low level, but I get spikes now and then. I really want to talk to people.  I messaged someone and told him to talk to me or I'd bite him, as a joke. His immediate response was ""im cleaning fuck off"". I'm lonely because I actually want to be social but trying to initiate it constantly is driving my self-worth into the ground. One of my close friends only really talks to me when she's doing badly. I don't mind helping her, I love her, but I wish we could talk normally. I wish I didn't have to post on my private stories, maybe twice a day, ""Someone go on a walk with me"" or ""Someone talk to me"". I don't get replies. 

I want to message people first. I want to take charge and start conversations. But I feel like people are beginning to talk about me behind my back because of how obviously desperate I am. I feel like I've crossed the boundary between ""endearingly social"" to ""overbearing and exhausting"" and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend is hosting a get-together for his friends tomorrow and I'm supposed to go but I want to stay home instead because I'm scared I'll just annoy everyone present. I'm scared I'm annoying him as well and I've thought about breaking up with him purely to save him the trouble of dealing with me. I have a lot of problems to work through and he lets me talk about them to him but I know he gets upset hearing about them and that's another reason why. I feel like if I were single then I wouldn't have any attachments with anyone and I could just delete Snapchat. It's my main way to communicate. If I don't have it on my phone, I can't message people and annoy them.

In Conclusion: I'm lonely because I feel like I annoy everyone

So yeah :) sorry for the long post. My psychologists over the years have said that I have symptoms of SA so maybe this is related to that",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation despite the presence of a boyfriend and a friend group. the author expresses a preference for quarantine as it provides an excuse to avoid social interactions, which is a complex mix of social anxiety and a desire for connection. the reliance on social media for interactions and the lack of direct, personal engagement contribute to feelings of loneliness. the author's attempts to reach out often result in negative or dismissive responses, further diminishing their self-worth and reinforcing their sense of being a burden. the feeling of being included in group chats but not receiving individual attention exacerbates the loneliness. the anxiety and self-doubt are clear indicators, as the author feels they are crossing boundaries and becoming overbearing, leading to fears of social rejection. the contemplation of breaking up with the boyfriend to avoid being a burden underscores the profound impact of loneliness on their mental health. overall, the narrative is rich with typical indicators of loneliness, such as social withdrawal, feelings of inadequacy, and a persistent desire for meaningful connections that are not being fulfilled."
"I'm ready to not exist.I don't have people who value me, no one is here. I'm not worth a cent of time. ",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of worthlessness and isolation, which are strong indicators of loneliness. phrases like ""i do not have people who value me"" and ""no one is here"" clearly highlight the individual's perception of being unloved and unsupported. the statement ""i am ready to not exist"" suggests a deep emotional pain and a desire to escape from their current state, which often stems from intense feelings of loneliness. the language used conveys a lack of self-worth and a belief that their presence is insignificant to others, further emphasizing their sense of disconnection and emotional solitude. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect an acute awareness of social and emotional isolation."
"I do not see the point in livingSo, after a hellish day family wise, I sat down to talk to a guy who has been my little slice of sunshine recently, only for him to tell me that we ??just don??t click?? and he doesn??t want me around anymore. This is after he got what he wanted (sexually- obvs on line due to Covid). And after that, and family being awful to me- including my dad finding it funny what the guy did to me- I just feel lonely as hell, depressed, and I just don??t see the point of carrying on.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a series of negative interactions with both family and a significant other, leading to feelings of rejection and worthlessness. the mention of a ""hellish day family wise"" suggests ongoing familial conflicts that exacerbate their sense of isolation. the person's attempt to find solace in a relationship ends in further rejection, as the other person admits they ""just don’t click"" and no longer wants them around. this emotional betrayal, especially after an intimate connection, intensifies the feeling of loneliness. additionally, the lack of support from the family, highlighted by the father’s dismissive reaction, compounds the individual’s sense of abandonment and despair. the culmination of these experiences leads to the individual expressing a profound sense of hopelessness and questioning the point of living, which is a severe manifestation of loneliness and depression. these elements together paint a picture of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness, struggling to find meaningful connections and support in their immediate environment."
"Feeling lonely, unhappy and dependent on other peopleI??m not exactly sure why, but often when I??m alone I feel so dead inside. I wish I had a girlfriend again so I didn??t have to sleep alone. When I??m in bed trying to sleep I just have to put on a YouTube video or a twitch stream, otherwise I feel so lonely and I keep myself awake, for hours sometimes, with my own thoughts. I keep telling myself that I need to learn to be happy on my own, but I keep feeling unhappy when I??m alone idk why.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loneliness and emotional dependence on others for happiness. the author explicitly mentions feeling ""lonely, unhappy and dependent on other people,"" which immediately signals an experience of loneliness. they describe a sense of emptiness and deadness inside when alone, indicating a lack of internal fulfillment or self-sufficiency. the longing for a girlfriend to avoid sleeping alone suggests a deep need for companionship and emotional connection. the reliance on youtube videos or twitch streams to fall asleep further underscores their struggle with being alone and the discomfort it brings. despite recognizing the need to be happy independently, the author admits to persistent unhappiness when alone, which highlights their ongoing battle with loneliness. these elements—emotional dependence, longing for companionship, discomfort with solitude, and external distractions—are all typical indicators of loneliness and illustrate the psychological struggle the individual is experiencing."
"I??m an unlikeable person, I??m lonely and it??s getting to me I think this is going to be like reading my diary. I thought if I got it all down on paper (keyboard and screen?), maybe I??d feel better. 

First thing I should say is I??m probably in a better place in life than a lot of the people here. I feel like a fraud for feeling bad about myself. I??m sorry for that and apologise in advance for anyone who feels annoyed or upset by my post. Then again, I am unlikeable so that won??t be a surprise. 

I??m married but my wife is often stressed about her job. Often she??s not really listening when I talk to her. It??s not a great feeling when the person who must love you the most in life isn??t that interested. I guess add boring to my list of character traits. When she is communicating with me we do get on really well.

My job often has me on my own for hours. I??ve not seen another person for five hours and I expect to go another three hours without seeing anyone today. I send messages to people I know in real life, people I know from Twitter, people on Reddit, but it??s always me doing the work. I??m always the last person to send a message and they??ll only contact me if they want something.  I was sitting around last night ?? my wife had gone to bed at nine ?? looking at my phone and thinking why am I so unlikeable? I??ve tried all sorts of things, being friendly, being funny, being attentive, being mysterious and being open. Basically being myself or not being myself, but whatever I am, people don??t like it. The number of new friends I??ve had for a few days is adding up and none of them stick around.

When I was young (under 11), being friendly, fairly clever and generally nice were good traits. I was never really popular but I had lots of friends at school and regularly played with them after. When it got to the teen years where being the clever kid meant all the cool kids would pick on me daily, I sort of retracted and didn??t go out. I think from the age of about 11-15, I only did something with people my own age about 5 times. After 16 things improved and I had friends, although none of them are still around. They all moved on when I was no longer useful to them to help with coursework or drive them around to the friends they really wanted to be with. Now as an adult I??ve basically got back into the situation where nobody really wants to talk to me. 

Unfortunately I haven??t come to some great conclusion or revelation in writing this. I guess I??ll leave this here for a bit and then delete it. Whatever.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a deep sense of being unlikeable and struggles with self-worth, which are common feelings among those experiencing loneliness. the mention of feeling like a fraud for feeling bad about oneself, despite being in a relatively better place in life, suggests a sense of guilt and isolation. the strained relationship with their wife, who is often stressed and not fully engaged, exacerbates feelings of being undervalued and ignored. the author's job, which requires long hours of solitude, further contributes to their isolation. the effort to maintain connections through messages, which are seldom reciprocated unless the other party needs something, highlights a one-sided and unsatisfying social life. reminiscing about past friendships that faded away once the author was no longer useful underscores a recurring pattern of transient relationships. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with persistent loneliness and a lack of meaningful, lasting connections."
No one cares??I just wan??t someone that cares about my existence..,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and a yearning for connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the statement ""no one cares"" suggests a perception of being ignored or undervalued by others, highlighting a lack of meaningful relationships or social support. the desire for ""someone that cares about my existence"" underscores the individual's need for emotional validation and recognition, which are fundamental human needs often unmet in lonely individuals. this expression of emotional pain and the plea for acknowledgment are clear signs of the deep loneliness experienced by the author."
"Lonely in a relationship

I am so madly in love with my boyfriend and I know he loves me too. But his love for me does not align with the amount of love and care that I have for him. I love him so much and I love everything he does for me. However I crave something deeper than this generic love he has to offer me. Maybe it??s just my insecurities but I feel so very lonely. I seek his comfort sometimes by expressing my insecurities(about myself-not the relationship) but he ignores me... he doesn??t want to hear it, he doesn??t ask me any follow up questions. I feel like whenever I??m sad and seek comfort from him, he ignores it and talks about something else. And for that reason I feel lonely. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. My boyfriend is only present in my happiness and absent in my sorrow. I love him and I??m always searching for something deeper within him but it just isn??t there. I seek the deeper things in life and he seeks only the surface of what life has to offer(money and such). We are so different, and we have such different values, and I??m waiting for something that won??t happen. Yes I have talked about this with him, but I feel like he doesn??t care. I always try to communicate with him, but It doesn??t work out. So here I am. I feel so lonely and I always have even when surrounded by people who love me. What??s wrong with me? I know I should break up with him but I??m so attached and I??ve also lost my virginity to him so it??s even harder. God I feel so ungrateful but I need a deeper connection, a deeper mind, a deeper soul, a deeper love; something he has failed to offer. Am I bad girlfriend for thinking this way? Am I a bad person?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness despite being in a relationship, which is a poignant indicator of emotional isolation. the writer expresses an intense love for their boyfriend but feels that this love is not reciprocated to the same depth. the repeated mention of craving something deeper and the boyfriend's perceived indifference to the writer's insecurities highlight a significant emotional disconnect. the writer feels ignored and unsupported during times of sorrow, which exacerbates their loneliness. the sense of being unheard and the frustration of unfulfilled emotional needs are classic signs of loneliness. the writer's reflection on their relationship dynamics, feeling ungrateful, and questioning their self-worth further underscore their internal struggle and isolation. the narrative vividly portrays the writer's longing for a deeper emotional connection and the profound loneliness that stems from not finding it in their current relationship."
"I don??t know how to describe how I feel now. Empty?Mondays might be the peak of my weeks because I recently started talking to a girl in my class. Last Monday was the first time I actually had a convo with her and it was great. This week we talked on the way to the library and had great conversations about different things again and met 2 of her friends on the way out and all talked for like an hour. For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was part of a friend group, no insecurities, just 4 people talking and having a good time. Or maybe I feel like that because I??m so deprived of human interaction.

But the other 6 days in a week I feel terrible. Just the usual hi??s and smiles to everyone and once the day ends, everyone has something to do while I go back home alone and wait for the next day I get human contact (I live relatively far away from campus while everyone else is closer). I don??t even like being alone anymore, It just makes me feel bad about myself.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness primarily through the contrast between the fleeting moments of social interaction and the prolonged periods of isolation. the author expresses feelings of emptiness and highlights how rare and cherished their interactions with the girl and her friends are, suggesting a significant deprivation of meaningful connections. the joy and sense of belonging experienced during these interactions underscore the loneliness felt during the rest of the week, where the author mentions feeling terrible and isolated. the description of going home alone and waiting for the next opportunity for human contact indicates a yearning for companionship and the negative impact of being alone on their self-perception. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reveal a profound desire for social engagement and the emotional toll of its absence."
"Socially Isolated Once AgainReligion has always played a supreme role in my life. My entire family is deeply religious and made sure to surround me with religious enthusiasts my entire life. I went to a poor religious private school, where we were taught pseudoscience and harmful social behaviors. The kids there were pretentious as all hell (b/c they would afford a private school?) and the teachers enabled them to be assholes. Growing in settings like this, I was indoctrinated and forced to conform. These children became all I knew, and I maintained the same general friend group since Kindergarten. This has left me extremely underdeveloped socially.

&amp;#x200B;

Having awoken, realizing religion is not real, I publicly left the church as a young adult (18). I have since been shunned from my family and childhood friends. No one checks up on me, or understands me. I feel distant, and unwanted. This loneliness has been plaguing me for months now. I'm tired of living without any meaningful social interactions. How do I learn to cope with my new reality? I may be alone for a few years now.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of social isolation and emotional pain. the individual recounts a life dominated by religious influence, which shaped their social interactions and friendships from a young age. they describe an environment filled with pretentious and harmful behaviors, which contributed to their social underdevelopment. the pivotal moment of leaving the church led to being shunned by family and friends, resulting in a lack of meaningful social connections. the individual expresses feelings of distance, being unwanted, and a deep sense of loneliness that has persisted for months. this emotional turmoil and the struggle to cope with a new reality devoid of supportive relationships are clear indicators of loneliness."
"I hate times like this where I'm just sitting here, thinking of my lifeI'm a loser etc. nothing new there. My loneliness is what's really hitting hard right now and I've never had a real friend. Even as a child. I was just tolerated and teachers forced people to be ""friends"" with me (someone told me when we were teenagers in the same school). Even the teachers seemed to bully me. Now I'm bordering 20 years old with no job or friends or life ahead of me and I'm still complaining about my childhood and how bad school was even though it's been two years now.",1,"the narrative expresses deep feelings of loneliness and isolation, as the author explicitly mentions their struggle with loneliness and lack of real friends throughout their life. they recount experiences from childhood where they felt merely tolerated and even bullied by teachers, which has left a lasting impact on their self-esteem and social connections. the author's reflection on their current situation, approaching 20 years old with no job, friends, or perceived future, further highlights their sense of despair and ongoing loneliness. the consistent theme of feeling alone and unsupported, coupled with the emotional weight of past negative experiences, are clear indicators of loneliness."
"I never fit in anywhereLooking back at my past friendships, i realise that no one ever liked me. I used to be the kid at the back of the class who the teachers ask 'why dont you play with your friends?' So I changed myself to fit in but those friendships never lasted. 

Now, I have no meaningful relationships.

I dont know whats wrong with me, im a kid in a middle class family and 2 parents. No abuse, nothing traumatic happened to me. So why am i so alone?",1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses a persistent feeling of not fitting in, which is a common sign of social isolation. the reflection on past friendships highlights a lack of genuine connection, as the writer mentions that no one ever liked them and that their attempts to change themselves to fit in were unsuccessful. this sense of not being accepted for who they are can lead to feelings of loneliness. the writer's current state of having no meaningful relationships further underscores their isolation. despite having a seemingly stable family background with no traumatic events, the writer still feels alone, indicating that loneliness can stem from a lack of emotional or social fulfillment rather than external circumstances. the questioning of what is wrong with them suggests a deep sense of personal inadequacy and confusion, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of loneliness, such as social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, and feelings of inadequacy."
"I just left an abusive relationship and could use some supportI just moved to a new area to escape my abusive ex. I don't feel comfortable sharing too many personal details because it's so fresh to me but I'm really struggling. I have three young kids. I'm struggling emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. My unemployment is taking forever to go through since I had go quit my job to move and I have very little money left to get what my kids and I need. I'm exhausted 24/7 because my kids have been struggling to sleep since we moved. I feel like a terrible mother. I have not made any new friends yet and my family is far away. I'm lonely and feeling hopeless right now and would love some emotional support and kind words please.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of loneliness through various aspects of the individual's life. the person has recently left an abusive relationship, which often leads to feelings of isolation and vulnerability. moving to a new area further exacerbates this loneliness, as they have not yet made any new friends and their family is far away. the struggle to provide for their children and the emotional, physical, mental, and financial stress contribute to a sense of being overwhelmed and unsupported. the exhaustion from their children's sleep issues adds to their sense of isolation and inadequacy. the explicit expression of feeling lonely and hopeless underscores their need for emotional support and connection. these elements collectively highlight the person's experience of profound loneliness and the urgent need for empathetic engagement and support."
"The depression that strikes when eased lockdown restrictions make no difference to your lifeRestrictions in England eased recently so people can meet in gardens and terraces and outdoor places e.g. outside pubs and restaurants etc 

It??s very depressing when the eased lockdown restrictions make no difference to your life and everyone else is seeing all the people they have been longing to see for months whereas for me, my life is still the same, I am still miserable and alone with no social life and mental and physical health issues. Wahoo, isn??t life fun!

I was outside earlier as I had to post a parcel and when I was walking back home everywhere was just full of people sat outside catching up with people whereas for me I was just alone and I stay in my miserable lonely existence.

I??ve had enough ????",1,"the narrative describes a deep sense of isolation and sadness despite the easing of lockdown restrictions. the author expresses feelings of being left out and unnoticed as others reconnect and resume their social lives. the mention of mental and physical health issues further compounds their sense of loneliness and despair. the author contrasts their solitary experience with the visible joy and interaction of others, highlighting their own lack of social connections. the use of phrases like ""miserable and alone,"" ""no social life,"" and ""miserable lonely existence"" are clear indicators of their emotional state. the narrative reflects a profound feeling of being stuck and disconnected from the world around them, which are common indicators of loneliness."
"my traumas shaped me into the person I am today and I can't bear living as myself anymoreTW: sxual assault

I was never educated on consent, sex and romance when I was little so I had to explore it all by myself, which led to a year or two of constant assault and slut-shaming from my classmates. At the time I didnt know it was bad and I would just play along in effort to fit in as ""one of the boys"" because I found it quite difficult to befriend girls (I was bullied by a girl deskmate for most of my elementary school years). The boys would call me sl*t, wh*re, anything degrading they could think of, the girls would see me getting assaulted in the middle of the class and ignore, my 7th grade was the start of my ever-declining mental health. I hated myself, I thought I was cheap, easy, undesirable and most of all filthy. I kept dating boys after boys to seek the validation and emotional warmth my parents didnt give me. They didnt know what I was going through and they weren't the type to shower their children with loving warmth. 

I end up a messed up person and ruined my chances with genuinely good people, while at the same time get into toxic relationships and endure even more harassment from my partner's friends. They lovebombed me so they could get in my pants, they pretended to be my friend to emotionally torment me for their sick twisted pleasure and I let them step on me just so I wouldn't feel lonely. My only best friend ever of 3 years dated me and I was genuinly happy for a short while, recently he dropped me for another girl and said he no longer wanted anything to do with me. I have absolutely no one to talk to anymore. I can't talk to my parents about anything, my sibling simply doesn't care, no one's interested in getting to know me.

 I like art, I like film, I like anime, I like music, I like fashion, I like playing games too. I listen and watch everything from mainstream to obscure &amp; I just wish someone would give me a chance to talk about it. I picked up so many hobbies in desperate attemps to connect to people but no one would want to befriend me.

It's been 6 years and I still can't recover from what happened those schoolyears. I have no self-esteem, I'm clinically depressed, anxious and on the verge of developing an ED from starving myself locking myself in my room. I feel unworthy of love because no one would want this used up, worn out mess that's been through everybody else's hands. I still get nightmares about my past relationships and SA often and everytime I would wake up crying until I can't see anymore. I'm full of shame, guilt, anxiety and trauma. All I want is to have a genuine friend but everyone wants to use me for something and I can't help but believe I'm worthless. I'm in mental anguish every minute I'm still alive. I don't want to exist in this disgusting flesh anymore. I've always contemplated suicide ever since the incidents and I don't know how much longer I can resist the urge to just end it all",1,"the narrative reflects profound emotional pain and a sense of isolation stemming from past traumas and ongoing mental health struggles. the individual describes a history of sexual assault, bullying, and toxic relationships, which have significantly impacted their self-esteem and mental well-being. the recurring theme of seeking validation through relationships, only to be met with further abuse and neglect, highlights a deep-seated loneliness. despite efforts to connect with others through shared interests and hobbies, the person feels perpetually rejected and misunderstood. their expressions of worthlessness, shame, and a lack of support from family and peers are strong indicators of loneliness. the mention of contemplating suicide underscores the severity of their despair and the urgent need for compassionate intervention and support."
"The World Is Taunting MeIt hurts so much seeing everybody tell a awesome stories about adventures they want on with friends and the like. People talking about getting invited to bowling and sleepovers or any other activities involving friends. But I??ve never had that. I??ve never been close with anyone irl. Nobody has ever cared about me, nobody has ever enjoyed me enough to invite me somewhere. I feel like this world is torturing me by showing me what I can??t have. It especially sucks because I??m actually really sociable but people at my school are incredibly bigoted and mean and overall just horrible people. I don??t think there??s been a day where somebody hasn??t been called a f*ggot or a n*gger here. It??s even worse because they make up like 99% of the place. So there??s really nobody to talk to. And like I said, it??s tenfold painful seeing my online acquaintances talk about how they??re gonna hang out with friends and the like, because then I like at myself and I realize that I have nothing and nobody.  Not to mention I don??t want to grow up with nothing meaningful to look back on. I want to be able to have stories to tell about my friends, I want moments I can look back at and laugh about with them, I just want this part of life to mean something when I look back on it. But no, nothing good ever happens to me. I wish this world could just kill me off. I feel like a dying prisoner being kept alive only so he can be tortured. I feel like a dying horse getting beat with a bat. I just wish there was someone. Someone to numb the pain that I have to go through everyday just for being alive.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful social connections. the author describes feelings of exclusion and unworthiness, noting the pain of witnessing others enjoy friendships and social activities while they remain on the outside. phrases like ""nobody has ever cared about me"" and ""i have nothing and nobody"" underscore a profound sense of loneliness. the comparison to a ""dying prisoner"" and a ""dying horse"" being tortured highlights the intensity of their emotional suffering. additionally, the author mentions the hostile environment at school, which exacerbates their feelings of alienation and lack of belonging. the desire for someone to ""numb the pain"" reflects a desperate need for companionship and emotional support, typical indicators of loneliness."
"Hometown BluesThis whole pandemic has made me realize how little my friends back home contact me. I??ve been back for a couple months now after being gone for work for about 5 months. You??d think that I??d see an increase in texting, calling, or video chatting from my friends, but I??ve gotten almost nothing since being here. I know everyone has their own lives, but I??m always the one to initiate contact and keep holding the conversations with my friends. I??m going to college here in a couple weeks, and I hope I??ll be able to find some friends to talk to while going to school. I want one of those groups that goes to bars together (when things open back up), ones that invite me to do things as I do them. I??ve never had that, and I??d love to experience not always asking first.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author describes a significant lack of communication from friends during a challenging time, highlighting the absence of reciprocal efforts to maintain relationships. the pandemic has exacerbated their feelings of disconnection, and their reflection on always being the one to initiate contact underscores a one-sided dynamic that contributes to their sense of loneliness. additionally, the author's anticipation of college life and desire for a more inclusive and engaging social group further illustrate their yearning for companionship and a break from their current state of isolation. their hope to experience mutual invitations and shared activities reflects a common desire among lonely individuals to feel valued and included in social interactions."
"I want to go back to before I knew what friends were likeIt's addicting. I had no friends before and it sucked but it's not like I knew any different. Now I know and I hate it. I found a nice Discord server and started to really enjoy myself there before I was banned without warning or reason, never breaking a rule. It's genuinely stupid how much it hurts. Nobody there has any interest in my friendship outside of that server. I can't stand going back to the loneliness, can't risk being hurt again.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. the author expresses a longing for the past when they were unaware of the joy and companionship that friends could bring. this sentiment indicates a significant emotional struggle, as they now know what they are missing. the pain of being banned from a discord server, where they found a sense of belonging, exacerbates their loneliness. the fact that nobody from the server has shown interest in maintaining a friendship outside of that space highlights their feelings of rejection and abandonment. the narrative also reveals a fear of being hurt again, which is a common psychological response to repeated experiences of social exclusion. these elements collectively underscore the author's current state of loneliness and their difficulty in coping with it."
"I smoke a half a day just to distract myself from being lonelyI'm sick of this ,"" It'll be okay one day "" is a lie .",1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of loneliness through the individual's admission of smoking as a coping mechanism to distract from feelings of isolation. the phrase ""i'm sick of this"" indicates a deep frustration and weariness with their current emotional state, suggesting that this is a persistent issue rather than a fleeting moment. additionally, the statement ""it'll be okay one day is a lie"" reflects a sense of hopelessness and disbelief in the possibility of improvement, which are common indicators of chronic loneliness. the narrative's tone and content highlight the individual's struggle with loneliness and their use of unhealthy habits as a means of temporary relief."
"14m rantI can't continue anymore, I feel like dying but I can't to do it to my family, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life, and I almost can't get out of bed each day, each time I go to sleep or wake up, I cry, and I can't continue like it, it's so hard, and I'm so alone, I feel like I have to be strong, and I can't show it to anyone.

It felt good to get it out, even if people haven't read this yet, well, I want to be better but I just don't know how, each day overwhelms me, I can't go to sleep knowing there is a day after, but it's harder to think that there won't be, I know I'm just 14 but I feel things too, and I hope no one feels like this too. This whole thing started some time ago, I had been doing something that took a toll on me, so much so that I got so stressed that I got sick out of it, and felt like the worst ever, my parents supported me each day of it, and I would be happy knowing that when I get back home I see them, it still hurt and was horrible but better, now it feels like everything I do, I think about how it was then, how hard it's been and how painful it was, I can't let my parents keep helping me, I know they want to but, it's hard for them too, to help and give and listen, and I can't be with my parents and brother because each one of them is never home.

I'm sorry it's so long I thank you for listening.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and despair, with the author feeling overwhelmed by their emotions and unable to find solace in their surroundings. the individual mentions an inability to continue and thoughts of dying, indicating severe emotional distress. the feeling of being alone is explicitly stated, and the person struggles with the idea of burdening their family with their pain, which is a common sentiment among those experiencing loneliness. the narrative also highlights a lack of social support, as the author feels unable to confide in friends and is often left alone at home. the repetitive mention of crying and the difficulty in facing each day further underscores the profound sense of loneliness and helplessness. despite having supportive parents, the individual feels guilty about relying on them, which adds to their sense of isolation. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with intense loneliness and emotional pain."
"20th Birthdayi'm sure there are just as many posts like this as there are users, but in under an hour, it will be the end of my 20th birthday. 
as expected, i spent it alone. i don't have any close friends, so i'm not surprised i wasn't wished happy birthday or anything like that, that wasn't a problem. the problem was just the entire day being a reminder of how alone i am.

the last 3 years of birthdays i've had haven't been ideal, and only get worse each year. it's just a really difficult time for me when everyone seems to always have atleast someone there to talk to meanwhile you're sat inside unable to do anything with anyone on your ""special day"" except vent about it to anonymous people on the internet.

less of a complaint and more of a way of getting stuff off my chest i suppose. 
i understand if this gets removed for any reason since this is just a jumble of whines put together in a sentence, but that's all.

thanks for reading x",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and sadness, particularly highlighted by the fact that the individual's 20th birthday was spent alone. the absence of close friends and the lack of birthday wishes are significant indicators of loneliness, as these experiences underscore a lack of social support and meaningful connections. the writer's reflection on the past three years of increasingly disappointing birthdays further emphasizes a pattern of solitude and unmet social needs. the feeling of being alone while others have someone to talk to exacerbates the sense of loneliness. venting to anonymous people on the internet instead of having a trusted friend to confide in also points to a lack of intimate relationships. the overall tone of the narrative is one of resignation and melancholy, typical of someone grappling with loneliness."
"Feeling guilty for wanting a high quality friendNot sure how many people out there are going through this. I guess it makes me a bit of a choosing beggar, but I really don't want to be friends with just *anyone*. 

I want to meet people who not only share a few surface level interests, but who I have true chemistry with. Who share my worldview, ideals, and perhaps even share a few important goals. Someone you can grow with and talk to on a deeper level. There's a time and place for small talk, but it's just not very nourishing on an emotional or spiritual level. 

After being alone/friendless for a certain amount of time, you just have a craving to speak to someone about something other than ""what's trending"", or swapping a basic list of ""things you do in your free time"". Quality adult conversation and companionship seems to be a commodity these days, but I'll be more than grateful when I find it at last.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep yearning for meaningful connections, indicating a significant level of loneliness. the author expresses a sense of guilt for desiring a high-quality friend, which suggests they might feel unworthy or unrealistic in their expectations. this self-doubt is a common trait among lonely individuals who often question their own standards and desires. the narrative also highlights a dissatisfaction with superficial interactions, emphasizing a craving for deeper, more emotionally and spiritually fulfilling conversations. the mention of being alone or friendless for an extended period further underscores the author's sense of isolation. this prolonged solitude and the specific longing for a companion with shared values and goals are strong indicators of loneliness. the detailed description of the kind of friendship they seek reflects a profound desire for genuine human connection, which is often absent in the lives of those experiencing loneliness."

"I feel empty when Im not playing games.I have one true friend that I have the honor of being friends with. But other than that, every time of get off I just feel empty. I dont talk to much of my family. Dont have a girlfriend. I have a handful of friends that i can talk to on games but not irl. Its sooo fucked. Be a sociable creature who cant socialize is the worst. I have tried to find someone that i could wake up and talk to every morning. Chat during the day and evening. Say our goodnights. But i never can. The only thing i have to look forward to is for that one good buddy of mine to get on for a few hours after school",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and longing for deeper connections. the author mentions feeling empty when not engaged in gaming, which suggests that gaming serves as a temporary escape from their underlying feelings of loneliness. the mention of having ""one true friend"" highlights the scarcity of meaningful relationships in their life. the author also expresses a lack of communication with family and the absence of a romantic partner, further emphasizing their social isolation. the desire for someone to share daily interactions with, and the inability to find such a person, underscores their deep yearning for companionship. the narrative conveys a sense of frustration and helplessness about their social situation, which are common indicators of loneliness. the reliance on a single friend for social interaction and the struggle to socialize in real life, despite being sociable by nature, are clear signs of the loneliness the author is experiencing."
"I feel lonely both normally and romantically.I??m young, yes I have friends but even when I try talking, i dunno if it??s my voice being low in volume sometimes but I feel unnoticed in the crowd and left out. Romantically I feel pretty lonely, not thinking I??m worth much of look good.",1,"the narrative reflects feelings of loneliness through multiple dimensions, both socially and romantically. the individual expresses a sense of isolation despite having friends, which suggests that the presence of social connections alone does not mitigate their loneliness. the mention of feeling ""unnoticed in the crowd"" and ""left out"" highlights a lack of meaningful engagement and validation from their social environment. additionally, the narrative reveals romantic loneliness, with the person doubting their self-worth and attractiveness, which are common indicators of low self-esteem and social anxiety. these feelings of inadequacy and invisibility are typical signs of loneliness, as they underscore a disconnect between the individual's social desires and their perceived reality. the narrative's emotional tone and specific examples of feeling overlooked and unworthy provide clear evidence of the person's struggle with loneliness."

Is a blessing in disguise though since I already worked as it for a whole year and my body just couldn't take it anymore.

"People that cheat on their partners don't deserve any type of love.Let me just start by saying that I have never been cheated on, so please don't recommend subs like r/survivinginfidelity. 

I guess I'm what you would call a ""forever alone"" type person. I'm not close with my family and I have no friends or romantic interests. When I see couples walking down the street holding hands it bums me out a little. I would love to have someone to fall asleep with and wake up to in the morning. Someone that I can cuddle up on the couch with and go on fun dates and have amazing sex. I really want intimacy but I know it's very likely I will never get it, so it really pisses me off when I see someone that's been cheated on. It takes a special kind of scum bag to betray a person's trust and break their heart to the point that they're not even the same person anymore. People get cheated on and they are so traumatised by it that they never trust anyone ever again, and they may also need to seek therapy. They get their heart broken in the worst way possible and they end up turning to drugs and alcohol to help them cope, and they may even turn to self harm and maybe even suicide.

Even if they recover from being betrayed, it's very possible that they still have self image issues and have low confidence/self esteem and they find it very hard to trust others and be intimate with them and commit to them. 

If you've cheated on someone then you're a piece of shit and you don't deserve love. They're are countless people out there that want nothing more than to fall in love and be happy, and here you are ripping out a person's heart and shitting all over it. In all seriousness, how do you sleep at night knowing that you're a piece of shit?

If anyone reading this has been cheated on, I'm so sorry you had to go through all that emotional stress and turmoil. I hope you recover and can find confidence within yourself and not let being cheated on define your worth as a person or a lover and I hope you find someone that will never betray you.

"Terrified of being lonely foreverI'm only 16 and I feel like loneliness will be here forever. I just can't conceptualize or believe that someday it'll be gone and I'll have friends. It's never seemed possible, and if I hope for it I'll inevitably be disappointed. I don't have good friends, I won't ever go to prom with anyone, I won't have fun in the last few enjoyable years of life before adulthood. All the adults I've met say it's depressing and horrible, that they're broke and work day after day just to make ends meet. And I can't even enjoy the parts that make life fun.

I wonder what's wrong with me that makes me unlovable. Why do I never get included? What do I keep doing wrong that incites these patterns of exclusion? People tell me I am very authentic, that I am always myself and never fake. So I need to accept I guess that my real self is meant to be lonely.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and hopelessness about forming meaningful connections. the writer expresses a pervasive fear that loneliness will persist indefinitely, indicating a lack of optimism about future social relationships. the recurring thoughts about not having good friends, missing out on significant social events like prom, and the inability to enjoy life highlight a profound sense of exclusion. the narrative also touches on self-doubt and self-blame, with the writer questioning their own worth and actions, wondering what makes them unlovable or excluded. the comparison with adults who describe their lives as depressing and monotonous further reinforces the writer's bleak outlook on the future. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they demonstrate a lack of social fulfillment, persistent negative self-perception, and a sense of despair about one's social prospects."
"The loneliness eats away at me, relentless in it's hunger.I'm an average 21 year old college going male, and I have friends, dear and close to me who I actively spend time with. I have family, who I may not always like, but who I do love, and who I'm fairly certain love me back. I have a social support group, and people with whom I spend time and do things with, and yet it just... there's something missing.

There's this desire inside me for a romantic relationship with a woman. The desire and need for that is so intense it sometimes dwarfs the gratitude I feel for the other relationships in my life. 
I don't know why but that's the only type of relationship missing from my life and I'll spend nights awake, curling into myself because that specific loneliness, the kind that comes from not having anyone to hold and kiss and make love to, the kind that comes from making breakfast for only one and finding a pretty flower and having no one to give it to, it just... fuck it hurts. It hurts and hurts and hurts and it's a physical fucking pain right in my gut, kind of to the left and above my belly button. I see people holding hands and loving each other and I'm so happy for them, but it also fills me with this... jealousy. And anger. And I just. I want that. I want to find someone who I can grow with and be with. 

And I'm not looking for my other half anymore. I understand that I, as a person, am and should be enough for my own life. I want someone who adds to and enchances my life. Because sometimes I'll make a souffl?? and it turns to ash in my mouth upon seeing that there's only one plate at my table. I'll be sleeping with five blankets on and a foot sticking out and the heat on and the fan at max and the windows open and yet the cold doesn't come from the outside, from a stray wind or a cool breeze. The cold comes from this place inside of me, seeping away all of my heat until all the blankets and all the heating in the world don't matter. The only thing that can warm my cold and rotting core is a pair of warm hands, and I just... don't have that.

And it's not a lack of physical intimacy that's causing it. I need emotional intimacy coupled with it. I'm sure I could go out downtown and find someone to have sex with it. But I don't want someone to just have sex with. Sex is meaningless. It's all sprawled limbs and heavy breathing and tongue and mouth and... ick. It's just. Without love and emotion, sex is just the mechanical action of human coupling. Our current society is so obsessed with looks, or money, or what you have and what you own, that people completely fail to see what's inside. It's like, your value is only determined by how good you look or how much money you have. I want someone to love me for ME. My soul. For who I am as a person, not what I have or what I can provide. I want the unconditional, unyielding love that I've only seen between parents and their kids, or read about in romance novels. I want someone who doesn't see my physical skin and bones, but rather what it houses, and the person inside and chooses to love that person, romantically. I've had this love from friends, but not romantically, you know? This pure love from my parents, and other loved ones, but I need it romantically. 

It's just all so complicated. These human emotions with human consequences. I wish life wasn't so goddamn complicated. I wish we didn't get hurt by people who claimed they loved us but were only after the things we provided. I wish the people we were meant to be with would find us and that they'd love us back when we found them. Most of all, I wish this loneliness would stop eating bits and pieces of me, or better yet, I wish I didn't need that romantic love, and that my restless heart could be satiated with the non romantic love that I already have in my life.",1,"the narrative clearly illustrates a profound sense of loneliness despite the presence of friends and family. the individual expresses a deep yearning for a romantic relationship, describing the lack of it as a gnawing emptiness that overshadows the gratitude for existing relationships. the pain is articulated vividly, highlighting the physical and emotional toll it takes. the longing for emotional and physical intimacy, beyond mere companionship or casual encounters, underscores a significant emotional void. the individual's reflections on societal values and the superficiality of modern relationships further emphasize a sense of isolation and disconnection. the narrative's intensity, emotional depth, and recurring themes of unfulfilled desires and emotional pain are typical indicators of loneliness."
"The worst kind of lonely is when you have someone so close to you yet you feel miles away from themWhen you have a girl, and you love her, but you can't express it, so it pushes her away. The feels...",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of disconnection despite physical proximity to someone significant. the author mentions feeling miles away from someone close, which indicates emotional isolation. this is further emphasized by the inability to express love to a significant other, leading to a sense of pushing her away. such expressions reflect common experiences of loneliness, where individuals feel misunderstood or unable to connect on a deeper emotional level. the use of phrases like ""the worst kind of lonely"" and ""you feel miles away"" highlights the depth of the emotional struggle and the pain associated with unreciprocated or unexpressed feelings, which are typical indicators of loneliness."
"How do I get used to loneliness?This year was miserable for me. I??ve dealt with loneliness like never before, and I happen to be a very energetic person. Sometimes I have so many ideas on where to go, what to do and what to let consume my energy. I have a boyfriend, but recently he has made me feel even more alone because of his lack of engagement in things. He sleeps till midday and disregards plans we made the night before. I spend the rest of my day waiting for him to wake up and get going... it never happens. My other childhood friend is busy with family. She has her cousin??s and sibling??s company all the time, so she??s never available. My phone is dead most of the time and no one is interested to ever invite me out. That one other friend who parted ways a long time ago disappears after we hang out and never calls again. I find myself to be a nice, non-judgmental person who initiates conversations about everything. I don??t think I have made anyone feel bad before and I am not annoying. I just have had a hard time making friends because I am a social outcast and a very introverted person. All it takes for someone to get close to me is the first approach and then I am the one who takes other steps.

Aside from all of that, I just want to look forward to getting used to loneliness now. To getting used to isolation and quit looking at how others are socializing and going places because that will never be me. I don??t want the next upcoming years to be as miserable as this one was due to crying every night because of the loneliness And worthlessness I feel. All this time I??ve been hoping that maybe I could reconcile with my old friends but it wasn??t possible due to unreturned interest. I have no one to rely on anymore, I miss how my boyfriend used to be and I miss my self. I have lost sense of who I am. I was a happy person, I still try to be whenever I can, I try dress up for my liking, I try to have fun but I have realized that the clothes I buy ..I have nowhere to wear, the fun I want to have is impossible to achieve with no one around me, and the laughter I aspire is nowhere near.",1,"the narrative vividly captures the essence of loneliness through various personal experiences and emotional expressions. the individual describes a significant change in their life, highlighting a stark contrast between their previously energetic and happy self and their current state of isolation and sadness. the mention of a disengaged boyfriend who fails to follow through on plans contributes to feelings of abandonment and unfulfilled companionship. similarly, the absence of available friends, coupled with the sense of being a social outcast, reinforces their solitude. the narrative also touches on efforts to maintain a semblance of normalcy and joy, such as dressing up and trying to have fun, which ultimately feel futile due to the lack of social interaction. the recurring theme of unreciprocated efforts in maintaining relationships further deepens the sense of worthlessness and despair. overall, the narrative is laden with classic indicators of loneliness, including emotional distress, social withdrawal, and a pervasive sense of disconnection from others."

What do you do when you feel lonely? How do you cope?I??m curious because I need to learn how to deal with it,1,"the narrative expresses a direct inquiry about coping mechanisms for loneliness, which is a clear indicator of the individual's own struggle with this feeling. the use of the first person, ""i need to learn how to deal with it,"" reveals a personal and immediate concern with managing loneliness. this sense of urgency and the personal nature of the question highlight a deep-seated need for connection and understanding, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative lacks mention of social interactions or support systems, further suggesting isolation. the curiosity about others' coping strategies also implies a search for solutions to alleviate their own loneliness, emphasizing the individual's current emotional state."
"Damn it quarantineSeeing all my neighbors just play outside, barbecue constantly and riding their bikes . Just reminds of how lonely I am. My original goal for quarantine was just to study while being in lockdown. However,  I didn't count on hearing so many people laugh and tell countless stories outside my window. So instead of working I'm just sitting here wishing I could have someone to have genuine laugh with.  Sometimes I just watch my neighbors then proceed to cry from all the love and affection being displayed(I know it sounds creepy sorry) . Also, I feel pretty pathetic for saying this but I would give anything just to receive a warm hug from someone. I want some type of connection or something like it. I'm usually able to play off these emotions move along to my class or job.  However,  being in lockdown has forced me to deal with my loneliness head on. It's eating at me like a fucking parasite barrowing in my skin at night. I'm getting so desperate for contact with anyone that I will go out searching for it wherever I can find it. I don't ever want to go to that dark place again considering how things usually end with me spending money nonstop or having sex with random dudes. I have such low self-esteem I would believe everything a random guy tells me.A guy could tell me if was raining  monkeys outside and I wouldn't even bat an eye at him.  I just want this quarantine to be over already my head is becoming my own prison again. I'm not strong enough to deal with this constant loneliness.",1,"the narrative vividly describes feelings of intense loneliness and isolation, exacerbated by the quarantine. the author contrasts their solitary experience with the visible camaraderie and social interactions of their neighbors, which amplifies their sense of exclusion. the longing for genuine connection, such as wishing for a warm hug, and the admission of crying when witnessing others' affection are clear indicators of deep emotional distress. the author also acknowledges their usual coping mechanisms, like focusing on work or school, are failing under the strain of lockdown. this forced confrontation with their loneliness leads to a visceral description of it as a parasite, indicating how profoundly it affects their mental state. the narrative also touches on self-destructive behaviors that emerge from desperation for human contact, revealing a pattern of seeking validation in unhealthy ways. the author's low self-esteem and susceptibility to believing anything for the sake of connection further highlight the depth of their loneliness. overall, the narrative is a poignant exploration of the psychological impact of isolation, marked by a yearning for connection and the pain of feeling disconnected from others."

"I think what I miss most is someone to share life with.The woman I thought I was lucky enough to meet at 20, to spend the rest of my life with, broke my heart at 22. Two years together. She's gone and I need to move on from that. I shouldn't dwell on the awful things she said and did to me. But I realize now what I miss might not be her, but someone to share life with. To laugh and cry, to hold and be held by. I don't know how I got by without her for my first 20 years, and I don't know how I'm going to get by without her. 

But I miss having someone to talk to about our shared interests, or teaching her more of mine, or learning more of hers. To believe that I can speak openly and freely about anything and not be thought less of for. I want someone to warm my bed again. To talk about our days when we both know what the day held wasn't interesting, but we talk anyways. Because we love each other. I miss being able to make someone's cheeks explode when I say something funny, and it make me feel both excited and nervous. I want again to have butterflies every time I kiss someone. To be looked at and feel the love in her eyes. Or to feel her laughing and slapping my back to ""Put me down!""

I don't know if I'm going to find ""her"" again. And while I'm stuck in my small college town for the next two years, I can't help but feel even more lonely.

Any advice on how to get out there and meet new people?,1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and longing for social connection. the individual explicitly states having no friends and not having spoken to anyone in almost six months, which is a significant indicator of loneliness. the feeling of losing oneself and being alone from morning until night underscores the emotional impact of their solitude. the difficulty in social interactions and meeting new people further exacerbates their sense of isolation. the plea for advice on how to connect with others highlights their desire for change and connection, which are common in individuals experiencing loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate a profound sense of loneliness and the psychological struggle associated with it."
"As lonely as I've never been before.Im 25, male and am currently as lonely as I never was. About 6 Months ago things spiralled downwards and for a few weeks/months. Im on Rockbottom. Dad Got sick 4 years ago, died 3 years ago, relation to other family members went from meh to bad/nothing. Had a bunch of friends and roommates. Moved out in bad terms. Girlfriend of 2 years left me. I completely isolated myself like never before in my life.      

Breakup is different than when Dad died. Both is losing a person you love.      

When someone dies the problem is that you can try as hard as you want. You won't be able to speak with them or reach them anyhow. After a breakup the person is just gone but still existing in this world. But handling it is similar. One has to be thankful for the past while looking forward.

I had phases before where I wouldn't meet with friends for some time or where I neglected attendance to events. Skipped school to not meet anyone. But never this long, this intense. If I look back I see it like reoccurring behaviour of mine. I worked out ways and mechanisms in the past to counter it, I really try to apply them but its hard to change old and establish new habits. Some times it works better than other times.

I think too early after my Dad died I met my now ex-girlfriend. I could focus a lot on making her happy instead of focus on my own improvement. I forgot myself in the relationship and was happy about it because I didn't want to think about what the fuck I actually have to do now where Dad is gone and Im just 22/23.        

In February I went to some self-help group. That was weird. But I think it actually was better being there than another lonely evening of web browsing. One time there already gave me some ""tools"" I try to work with. I want to go again this month.      

Earlier this week I failed my driving exam. One of the few things I tried in a long time. Afterwards the examiner said that at first he thought I was joking but then was afraid of his life. lol. Why the fuck do I pay driving teacher money when he doesn't actually teach me to drive and sends me to test like that.     

I think start of my process of becoming a man again instead of being a lonely, stoned slug is to take responsibility.       

I fucked up the exam. I will go back to learning and try again soon. Focus on the future.       

But one of the big problems I have is that there is just so much time to fill and nobody to share with. Does happiness even exist when there is nobody to share it with? Next week new semester begins and a few weeks ago I started to run and swim a bit again. Both lonely activity but its improvement. Improving everyday a little. What do I want this week, in the next 10 weeks, where do I see myself in 6 months?      



I will stop here. Sorry for wall of text, anyone actually reads this far? :D

I'm everyone's ""mate"" but No Ones Friend if u catch my drift. And no one seems to care. I spend my days drawing and nothing else. And when I get upset about my life the only people who can or will try cheer me up are my family. And I hate when they give me advice because it does nothing for me. And when my friends do occasionally try help. Everything seems false or flat. Like there trying to just shut me up. I've been trying to get a girlfriend for ages now. But no such luck. I'm like a normal looking guy. And I try to look my best but I guess I'm not much to right home about. Not to mention I have best trust issues. So I can't really be happy even if I find live because I'll think they secretly hate me. So there's my life. Just kinda wanted to vent because I have no one to talk to.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and disconnection from others. the individual mentions feeling lonely for years and has come to a point of acceptance about their bleak life. despite having friends, they feel like background noise and perceive themselves as merely a ""mate"" rather than a true friend. this highlights a lack of meaningful, deep connections. the absence of messages from anyone and the feeling that no one seems to care further emphasize their loneliness. the individual spends their days drawing, which can be seen as a solitary activity, and expresses frustration with the advice from family and friends, which feels insincere or ineffective. their struggles with forming romantic relationships and trust issues compound their feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. overall, the narrative contains several indicators of loneliness, including a lack of meaningful social connections, feelings of being overlooked and misunderstood, and a sense of hopelessness about their situation."

I've always been the one who follows not leads. Always have to follow 'popular people' around and let them pick on me tell me i'm ugly and don't matter to the world.
Even my family makes me feel like that most times?? be that one guy that puts on a fake smile on his face every day and makes it look like he's having fun. I've never really dated much just twice , no one thinks I'm Cute. But who cares?

And there it is again, that pain right in the chest. I haven't felt that in awhile.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness through the description of the author's long-standing social anxiety and difficulty in forming friendships. the mention of being a middle child with ""mass social anxiety"" and ""mental issues"" highlights a persistent struggle with social interactions and self-esteem. the author's age of 21 is noted with regret, suggesting that these issues have had a significant and ongoing impact on their life. the encounter with the woman at the beach is a rare moment of emotional connection for the author, described vividly as making their heart ""feel again"" and bringing them joy. however, the subsequent rejection and the woman's decision to pursue a relationship with someone else brings back intense feelings of pain and loneliness. this emotional rollercoaster—briefly experiencing connection and then returning to a state of isolation—underscores the author's underlying loneliness and the profound impact of their social struggles on their emotional well-being."

I just needed to say this to someone",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses feelings of abandonment and rejection, which are central to experiences of loneliness. the initial relief of not feeling alone after gaining a new friend highlights the importance of social connections for the individual. however, the subsequent distancing and reduced interaction from the friend exacerbate feelings of isolation. the mention of the friend abandoning them for someone else suggests a sense of being replaced or not valued, deepening the emotional impact. the writer's uncertainty about what to do and their need to share these feelings with someone further underscore their sense of loneliness and the absence of a supportive social network. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone struggling with loneliness due to disrupted social bonds and a lack of meaningful engagement."

Just wanted to get this out.  3:",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and self-awareness about the individual's social challenges. the person describes being physically alone in a room full of people, which is a strong indicator of emotional loneliness. the writer's self-perception as boring, sad, introverted, and anti-social further highlights their struggle with low self-esteem and social anxiety. the longing for confidence and extroversion suggests a desire to connect with others but feeling inherently incapable of doing so. the repeated wish to not be alone and the expression of anxiety about making friends in high school underscore a pervasive sense of loneliness and a yearning for social acceptance. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone who feels disconnected from their peers and is experiencing significant loneliness."

Like, I'd rather be a quarter million in debt than continue being so lonely.People are flabbergasted when I tell them that I still have no friends or significant other despite all that I've done. Is this just my destiny; to be a square peg in a world of round holes? Am I doomed?",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness, evident through the author's extensive efforts to combat it, including attending social events, engaging in physical activities, and making lifestyle changes. despite these attempts, the persistent feeling of isolation remains, suggesting a deep-rooted struggle. the mention of ongoing therapy and medication highlights the seriousness of their condition. the author's comparison of their loneliness to being in significant debt underscores the emotional burden they feel. their rhetorical questions about destiny and being a misfit further illustrate a sense of hopelessness and alienation, common indicators of loneliness."
"Does anyone else make up stories in their head and can't stop?Hey y'all,
I just discovered this sub and after crying for 30mins straight after realizing how much I relate to all of you I started thinking about my loneliness and the first time I really noticed it. 
I told someone when I was about 7 years old, that I made up stories and worlds in my mind and played them out in my head before falling asleep, kind of like a goodnight story for myself. The other person just looked at me weird and laughed at me. She told others and they all made fun of me.


The thing is, I still do this. I still make up a story for myself while trying to fall asleep. Mostly the stories will be inspired by movies/series/books etc. 
I like to imagine myself being the well liked lead role or my own character who's liked by everyone in that imaginary scene. It makes me feel powerful and not so lonely anymore. 
Due to corona my school is closed so I have a lot of time and lately I've noticed that I will take about 3-4 naps a day and set 5 alarms for after my ""big"" sleep so I can fall asleep multiple times. That way I can make up more stories instead of facing the hard truth that I'm lonely as fuck.
So I guess my question is wether anyone else imagines scenes in their head as well and if anyone has tips for kind of getting control over it again?


tl;dr:
I make up stories before I go to sleep where I'm well liked and it's gotten to a point where I'll sleep multiple times a day just to imagine a scene in my head. 
Does anyone else do this?
Does anyone know how I can stop this from deteriorating further?",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the author describes a deep sense of isolation that dates back to childhood, where their imaginative storytelling was met with ridicule rather than understanding, exacerbating feelings of alienation. the coping mechanism of creating stories in which they are well-liked and powerful suggests a longing for social acceptance and connection, which they are not experiencing in reality. the recent increase in this behavior, especially with the added context of the pandemic and school closures, highlights a significant retreat into their inner world to escape the harsh reality of their loneliness. their plea for tips on controlling this behavior indicates an awareness of its potentially detrimental effects and a desire for change, further underscoring their struggle with loneliness."
"The more lonely I feel the more aggressive I've been feelingSo this has been happening for a least a couple of years, but I've noticed that this has been getting even worst this year.
So I really, really feel lonely, I feel like i have no one to be me, like i don't really belong with people or social environment's.
And the more I feel like that, the more I'm starting to hate everyone else, like real hate. I can't stand anyone because I don't think as them as equals, they're inferior to me. But the real thing is that I feel really lonely and it's my only way to get over it.

"I have to deal with my pain alone.There's nothing quite like battling depression and trauma, and not even having someone who cares if I make through the night or not. I hate when I breakdown and have to pull myself out of it again and again, saying it'll get better. I have to rely on myself, but I'm so, so tired of just having myself. All I want is at least one person to care, to tell me I mattter, someone who wants to see me get through this. But with my poor social skills and not being able to afford a therapist, I don't see that happening for a long time. If ever.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and despair, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the author describes dealing with pain alone and highlights the absence of anyone who cares about their well-being, which underscores their feelings of abandonment. the mention of battling depression and trauma without support amplifies their sense of solitude. the repeated self-reliance, despite being tired of it, points to a lack of a supportive network. the yearning for someone to care and affirm their worth further emphasizes their loneliness. the acknowledgment of poor social skills and financial barriers to accessing professional help suggests a prolonged struggle with isolation. these elements collectively illustrate a profound sense of loneliness."
"I got dumpedMy boyfriend dumped me about two weeks ago and I feel so alone and depressed, I can hardly get out of bed and feel so isolated.",1,"the narrative reflects significant indicators of loneliness, particularly through the expression of feeling alone and isolated after a breakup. the individual mentions being dumped by their boyfriend, which is a triggering event that often leads to feelings of abandonment and loneliness. the description of struggling to get out of bed and experiencing depression are common symptoms associated with loneliness, as these emotions can be exacerbated by the loss of a close relationship. the use of words like ""alone"" and ""isolated"" directly point to the person's sense of disconnection from others, which is a core aspect of loneliness. additionally, the timeframe of two weeks suggests that the feelings are relatively recent and intense, further emphasizing the immediate impact of the breakup on the individual's emotional state. these elements collectively highlight the presence of loneliness in the narrative."
"I just want a friend in real lifeI'm in 10th grade and I haven't been able to make a single friend since 4th grade. I miss having friends and people to talk to like when I was little. I've been trying for years to improve my social skills but it's just not working. I haven't had a hug from someone that isn't family in years. I have no motivation to go to school because nobody talks to me. I feel like I'm virtually invisible to everyone. I just miss being able to hug people, touch other people's skin, talk without worrying about saying something stupid. I miss when I was a carefree little kid. I have so many online friends but it's just not the same. I just want real friends",1,"the narrative clearly reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. the writer expresses a strong desire for real-life friendships, indicating a significant gap in their social connections. they recount their inability to make friends since 4th grade and the emotional impact of this prolonged isolation. the longing for physical affection, such as hugs, and the mention of feeling invisible at school are poignant indicators of their loneliness. the comparison between their current state and their happier, more socially connected childhood further emphasizes their sense of loss and longing. the presence of online friends, while somewhat comforting, is acknowledged as insufficient, highlighting the writer's need for tangible, in-person relationships. the overall tone of the narrative, filled with yearning and a sense of invisibility, aligns with common psychological indicators of loneliness."
"""I am lonely""- A femaleMy favorite thing is when I'll meet a guy and try to be friends, then he'll talk about how being lonely sucks and I'll agree, but that agreement sits wrong with him because I'm a girl and girls don't lack friends, right? (And now we see why he's lonely, too.) 

Alright, you caught me, I lied. Truth be told, I have friends. I also have trust issues because of things bizarre situations with extensive lies that don't even matter but they were enough to make me wonder what is and isn't true. That's just impermanence, baby. 

Speaking of impermanence, is it still a lie if it was true in the moment? Is it still a lie if it's not true to the moment, but true to the needs your mind puts above honesty? 

When I had trouble sleeping, I'd take medication every night, and I'd lay there and think til I slept. I could always tell they were working because I couldn't touch my thoughts. They were there, but too far away to keep. I'd chase them until I slept. Now, I take a different medication to kill the imagining when my eyes are closed. I am not sure if my life is better without nightmares.

Back to my original point, I am lonely. 
I'm torn between making the friendships I have into what I want (people aren't disposable) or starting over. I was someone dark on the inside, who openly shows it, but they long for good. Long for good with me? I don't think my friends have the emotional capacity for what I'm describing. There's a certain door in the hall of personality that can only be unlocked with trauma and understanding. Understanding is the real key there.
I don't love them any less (believe me, I've got much love to give and I try to give it to everyone I've met), but I don't believe we can be friends on a deeper level. You can't blame them for what they haven't experienced. I'm trying to grow. I did so well with it lately and it only has been through God-given hard work. 

I long for someone to long for good and growth with, someone I can tell my random memories to without them being mildly disturbed and confused (especially when they're not even bad), someone who understands humans the same as I do, someone who will laugh at dark things that aren't jokes at all with me, while understanding the different between blatant arrogance and a joke, someone who will make me less lonely, but only at my core.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness through the author's introspective and contemplative reflections. the individual expresses feelings of isolation despite having friends, indicating a disconnect between superficial social connections and the deeper emotional bonds they yearn for. their mention of trust issues and past traumas further highlights a barrier to forming meaningful relationships. the author’s struggle with understanding truth and impermanence suggests an ongoing internal conflict, which is compounded by their difficulty in finding someone who can truly understand and connect with them on a profound level. the longing for someone who shares their depth of understanding and can appreciate their dark humor and introspective nature underscores their sense of being misunderstood and emotionally isolated. these elements collectively point to the author experiencing loneliness, as they navigate the complexities of their emotions and relationships in search of genuine connection."
Lonely teen here that only got lonelier after a girl I had fallen for told me she was a lesbian. Still can??t get her out of my head a year later.[removed],1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and unreciprocated affection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the writer mentions feeling increasingly lonely after discovering that the person they have feelings for is not interested in them romantically. this unrequited love has persisted for a year, suggesting a prolonged emotional struggle and an inability to move on, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the use of the term ""lonely teen"" at the beginning immediately sets the tone of the narrative, indicating self-awareness of their emotional state. the inability to get the girl out of their head highlights an obsessive longing and a focus on what they cannot have, which often intensifies feelings of isolation. the narrative lacks any mention of other supportive relationships or coping mechanisms, further emphasizing the depth of their loneliness."
"I just miss my friendsI had many friends, I was happy and didn't really feel lonely or sad since I had such a big support group. We all did things together, hangout every single day and had fun being stupid together, it literally was the perfect setup. 
Fast forward a couple years and we go into 2016, it was a great year for me since I had an amazing job that paid insanely well. 
Things changed though, I noticed people quit hitting me up, they were getting offended over my jokes I posted on Facebook and I noticed my friends list was shrinking.
I downloaded an app called ""Who Unfriended Me?"" which tells you in real-time the moment someone unfriended you on Facebook, with their full name so you know who it was exactly.
Once I installed that app I got dozens of notifications daily from it saying ""&lt;insert name&gt; has unfriended/ blocked you"". And it was all from the people I thought were my best friends, over the course of about a week or so I had already lost 80+ friends and counting.
The last straw was on my birthday NOBODY wished me a happy birthday, dead silence for the entire day. 
That was what made me decide to deactivate my account and just forget about everyone. I just think back on all the fun I had and I just miss all my friends, its been lonely living life without friends and I wish them all the best.
I know this is long but I just wanted to talk about this since nobody irl wants to hear it and points all blame at me.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loss and isolation, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual reminisces about a time when they had a strong social support system and were happy, contrasting it with their current situation where they feel abandoned and disconnected. the repeated mention of losing friends, the lack of birthday wishes, and the deactivation of their social media account highlight their feelings of rejection and exclusion. the use of an app to track who unfriended them indicates a preoccupation with social relationships and a heightened sensitivity to social rejection. the final statement about wanting to talk but finding no one willing to listen underscores their sense of isolation and the lack of social support in their current life. these elements collectively point to a deep experience of loneliness."
Lonely af as usual[deleted],1,"the narrative reflects a clear expression of loneliness through the use of the phrase ""lonely af,"" which explicitly communicates the individual's feeling of being isolated. the addition of ""as usual"" suggests that this is not a transient state but a recurring experience, indicating a deeper, more chronic sense of loneliness. the brevity and bluntness of the statement, along with the choice to delete further content, might suggest a feeling of hopelessness or resignation, common in individuals experiencing loneliness. these elements together point to an ongoing struggle with loneliness, highlighting the emotional weight and persistent nature of their isolation."

And just do everyday school stuff .Anyways hope everyone having a good day :)",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for companionship. the individual describes a traumatic event, the burning down of their house, which serves as a catalyst for their feelings of loneliness. the contrast between the numerous calls received by their mom and the mere two texts they got from a friend highlights their lack of social support. they express a clear desire for friends, especially in times of crisis, and feel the absence of a supportive social network. the frustration and anger of their mom exacerbate their sense of isolation, as they are now confined to a hotel with no one to interact with. their observation about school groups and their struggle to be included further underscores their social isolation. the wish to have people to hang out with and engage in normal school activities indicates a craving for normalcy and connection. overall, the narrative is filled with typical indicators of loneliness, such as lack of social support, feelings of exclusion, and a strong desire for companionship."
lonelyI'm still lonely,1,"the narrative expresses a clear and direct declaration of loneliness, which is a strong indicator of the individual's emotional state. the repetition of the word ""lonely"" emphasizes the intensity and persistence of this feeling. this kind of explicit expression often signifies a deep sense of isolation and a yearning for connection. in psychological terms, such statements can reflect an acute awareness of one's own solitude and a lack of social support or meaningful relationships. the brevity and straightforwardness of the narrative further highlight the simplicity and rawness of the emotion being conveyed, making it a typical indicator of loneliness."
"I might just end up a hermit, what's the point of living surrounded by people when I have never felt loved my in my life?Im about as normal person as one can be, except I don't think living in society is doing it anymore. 

In my 24 years of life by far the thing I've felt the most is rejection, rejection from my family, my friends, my ""love interests"", my peers, etc.  I've struggled with low self esteem for a long part of my life because I've never received validation from the outside, I've had to learn to validate and love my self because literally no one else will, normally I'd think that's a sign that I'm a shitty person and I need to change myself but I don't think that's it anymore, for years I've been working on improving myself, I've tried to be a better person, more empathic, more loving, more outgoing and more understanding but the result is still the same: I'm still lonely ALL. THE. TIME. 

What's the point of being surrounded by people if it ultimately makes me feel worse? The only person with whose support and love I can always count on is myself so why am I even bothering trying to connect to people? 

So I have a plan, this summer I'll finish college and im going away on a backpacking trip all by myself and I'll live off the land for at least a couple of months until I decide wether I'll go back or I'll keep going. I wont say where I live or where I'm going but simply put, im going south. I'll go as far south as I can. I might come back to my hometown or not, I'll make up my mind during the trip. 

I want to, for at least one time in my life, live completely independently from everyone else and be truly free, if I'm to be alone, I rather be alone doing what I love outside of the endless contradictions of living in the civilized world. 

TLDR: society and rejection bad, isolation and self-reliance good",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and rejection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author describes a life filled with rejection from various social connections, including family, friends, and peers. this persistent rejection has contributed to low self-esteem and a belief that they must rely solely on themselves for validation and love. the individual's contemplation of becoming a hermit and their plan to embark on a solo backpacking trip to escape societal interactions further underscore their feelings of loneliness. the narrative also highlights a sense of hopelessness about forming meaningful connections, as efforts to improve themselves and become more empathetic and outgoing have not alleviated their loneliness. the desire to live independently and away from society is a clear expression of their struggle with loneliness and their belief that isolation might be a preferable alternative to the pain of social rejection."
"This is a terrible time to try find a girlfriendRecently I decided to try get myself out there more and find a girlfriend (I've never had one before and pretty much every girl finds me unattractive. Never had someone want to be with me romantically) but boy could I have not chosen a worse time! The way I look and my shitty social skills were hurdles I could work on but quarantine is something out of my control. Anyway, I'm lonely and wish I had someone that loved me the way I've loved others in the past. A girl I love who loves me back, that would be nice.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness through several key indicators. the author explicitly mentions their desire to find a girlfriend and their feelings of being unattractive and unwanted, which are classic signs of loneliness and low self-esteem. the mention of never having had a romantic partner before and the feeling that every girl finds them unattractive further underscores their sense of isolation and lack of romantic connection. the frustration with quarantine exacerbates their loneliness, as it prevents them from taking steps to improve their social situation. the longing for mutual love and the acknowledgment of past unreciprocated feelings highlight their emotional need for companionship and affirmation. these elements collectively illustrate the author's profound experience of loneliness."
"The worst thing about loneliness is when you cry, you have no one to talk to and tell that you're sad. You just cry alone.Wish i had friends",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the mention of crying alone and having no one to talk to highlights the absence of social support and connection. the desire for friends further underscores the individual's longing for companionship and the pain of their solitary state. these elements are consistent with feelings of loneliness, as the individual lacks meaningful interactions and emotional outlets to share their sadness. the overall tone of the narrative conveys a profound sense of being disconnected from others, which is a key characteristic of loneliness."
"Trying to kick addiction, but the lonelyness is pushing me back.I (m24) have been an every day cannabis smoker for 11 years now, to be honest those 11 years have been pretty happy, I have very supportive friends and family and I feel so grateful for that. The current pandemic has led me to no longer have the funds to cover my habit, so I have decided to cut weed and tobacco out of my life. This is no doubt the hardest thing I have ever tried to do, but I can see the positives of leaving it. My real problem is that I feel totally disconnected from everyone around me, I have always felt this way but when I'm stoned I can easily overlook these feelings and they don't affect me. When I'm sober I cannot overlook this, it affects me terribly everyday knowing that I have no one to vent to, no one to talk to, no one who really cares. My friends have decided to continue smoking, so I have had to distance myself if I'm to have any chance of success. I can talk to my mum about it but she always becomes very insistent that leaving the house will help, meeting new people and all that, I live in a tiny village in cornwall in the south west of england. Going out does not allow me to meet new people as I already know 90% of everyone who lives here. Plus I don't drink. So going to the pub is in no way an option for me. I really struggle to connect with people because of this, in my local area most people socialise at the pub, being someone who likes to stay as far away from alcohol as possible I do not go to the pub. Socialising is far far easier for me when I'm stoned, and that feeling is making me think, what's the point in quitting when life felt so much better when I was stoned. I genuinely feel that if I could find a group (or just 1) new friendship that doesn't revolve around smoking my mental health would improve tenfold. But obviously that is far more easily said than done. 

Thanks for reading, just needed to vent somewhere. Even if no one sees.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and disconnection despite the presence of supportive friends and family. the author describes a long-term reliance on cannabis to manage feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which have become more pronounced during attempts to quit. the struggle to find meaningful connections without the aid of substances highlights a deep-seated loneliness. the author’s perception that no one truly cares, compounded by the physical isolation in a small village and the avoidance of common social venues like pubs, further exacerbates these feelings. the yearning for a new, non-smoking friendship underscores the desperate need for genuine human connection. the narrative is a clear reflection of the psychological distress and loneliness that can accompany addiction and the difficulty of overcoming it without adequate social support."
"I??m a college junior and I have no college friendsSpecifically, I am an art school student. I have been here since my freshman year of college. 

I attend a college in a different state, so no one here is anyone I??ve known since Highschool nor did I come here with anyone I??ve known. When I was a freshman in college I had some really toxic roommates, who were really rude, made fun of me, yell at me about things, and only talk to me just to tell me what was wrong with my art during critiques. They also didn??t like me because I wasn??t like them, because I was ??nerdy??/??dorky?? and not stereotypically feminine, or didn??t smoke/vape, drink, have any dating or sexual experience. I??m convinced one of them was a complete narcissist and she really manipulated the other and would even bully her, but she was too insecure and even a bit stupid to see how terrible of a friend she was.

I had no friends at all then. I eventually had been moved out of that dorm because of how bad the abuse had gotten. I was then moved into another dorm that next semester. With a roommate and suitemates I had gotten along with pretty well. Then the corona pandemic hit and we all pretty much moved out of the dorm building that spring break. Unfortunately I never had any way of contacting them, no phone numbers, no social media, nothing. One of them actually had been following my Instagram for awhile, but she eventually unfollowed me because my content didn??t appeal to her (I??m an art blog and meme account on Instagram). We were never close or anything, but I guess it kinda made sense for her to unfollow me. Now being in the present, I do see them in the halls and such. I say hi and try to be friendly, but I worry they forgot about me. (That is the roommate and suitemate that didn??t unfollow me on Instagram)

My last school year was obviously all online, so I didn??t get to interact with anyone and I never did turn on my web cam all that much for people to recognize me. Except what would be the point anyway? I don??t have any friends and I doubt anyone would try to get to know me if they saw me in person. I had a roommate that school year who was generally pretty friendly and did try to get to know me, but she was always visiting her boyfriend every weekend, so we never got to form a proper friendship, yet she seemed to have ties to other classmates and good at making friends. That next semester she decided to stay home, because she thought it was silly we were living in dorms when not going to physical classes. I occasionally see her in the hallways, and she says hello in all. But we??re not in any classes or anything.

With now college being in person again, I am reminded just how lonely I am and how I barely have any friends. It??s like literally everyone in all my classes know someone in there and manage to have a conversation with everyone. Even the people who don??t talk for shit or even try. How? They even get invited to do stuff and make plans after class and for weekends and get invited to eachothers dorms. 

Occasionally we get put into groups, and luckily enough there??s sometimes someone in that group that wants to have a conversation. Except there??s been occasions where I get 3rd wheeled in those. Because 2 people in those groups really begin to hit it off. I would share my social medias, except unfortunately they??ve become a place for me to vent and I??m someone who doesn??t share my Instagram with people I barely know. Because I can??t explain the hellhole it??s become and I don??t want people to know of the petty asshole I usually come off as (venting that is).

It??s even a little infuriating too. The roommate I have this school year is very socially awkward and a little weird and barely ever talks to me. She claimed to have no college friends, but apparently she has conversations with classmates in classes, gets invited to do stuff, and sometimes invites people to our dorm. Like motherfucker, yes you do. 

I even fear my Highschool friends (my only friend group) are losing interest in me. I feel like they don??t care about my interests, new things I??ve discovered or watched and things I??m writing. I had recently gotten invited to hangout with friends over this Thanksgiving break and I felt a little 3rd wheeled a bit there. I don??t know or think I??ll be losing them as friends. But I don??t know what to do. 

I was pretty lonely in Highschool too, I literally went into Highschool alone and with no friends. It wasn??t until 2nd semester of sophomore year I actually started to have a friend group. 

It??s just why does everyone else to get to function normally and not me? 

I feel like I??ll go all of college not having any college friends. Please don??t suggest for me to join clubs or anything, they never work and I??ve tried and it never works.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and social disconnection that is characteristic of loneliness. the individual recounts their experiences with toxic roommates during their freshman year, which contributed to their feelings of alienation. despite moving to a new dorm with more amicable roommates, the onset of the pandemic disrupted potential friendships. the writer's inability to maintain contact with their suitemates and the subsequent lack of meaningful interactions during online classes further exacerbated their sense of solitude. they express a belief that no one would be interested in getting to know them, a common thought pattern among lonely individuals. the narrative also highlights moments of being a ""third wheel"" in social settings, reinforcing their perception of being an outsider. their reluctance to share their social media due to its use as a venting platform indicates a fear of vulnerability and judgment, which can hinder forming new connections. additionally, the writer feels disconnected from their high school friends, fearing they are losing interest in them. overall, the narrative is marked by a recurring theme of social rejection and a pervasive belief that they are unable to form lasting friendships, which are strong indicators of loneliness."
"(20 F) feeling super lonely and indifferent latelyI??ve always been shy, quiet and reserved so making friends was incredibly hard growing up. On top of that my father was in the military so we moved around a lot. Not having solid friends became the norm and now as an adult I find myself very empty, lonely and codependent. I got out of a three year relationship a few months ago and he was literally my other half. He understood me, he became my best friend, we did everything together. It??s been really hard to part ways, for me at least, and I find myself super confused and hurt about what relationships are and how they??re suppose to be. I went from having someone next to me for three whole years to having no one at all, and it hits me the most when I??m lying in bed and no ones there beside me. I??ve tried to get back into dating and or at least talking to people but it feels really really meaningless and I don??t connect with any of them like I connect with him. I also have the fear of getting into another relationship and again a few years down the line I??m in the same predicament. I??m in a really rough place and just want to know someone understands.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the author describes a lifelong difficulty in making friends due to shyness, frequent relocations, and a reserved nature, which are all common precursors to feelings of isolation. the recent end of a significant three-year relationship has exacerbated these feelings, leaving the individual feeling empty, lonely, and codependent. the intense bond with their ex-partner, described as their ""other half,"" highlights the depth of their emotional reliance and the profound impact of the breakup. the author’s struggle to find meaningful connections in new relationships and their fear of future heartbreak further underscore their sense of isolation. the loneliness is most palpable when they mention lying in bed alone, a time when many people feel their solitude most acutely. the narrative concludes with a plea for understanding, a poignant reflection of their deep-seated need for connection and support. these elements collectively paint a vivid picture of an individual grappling with profound loneliness."
"Agonizing Birthdays.Anyone else hate their birthdays? For me, it's a yearly reminder that I posses no genuine friends to celebrate it with, and that I am engulfed in absolute loneliness. Some may consider it the best day of the year, but I see it as the worst. Just a day reminding me that I've been alive for another year, though the feeling of truly living is unbeknownst to me. I apologize if this sounds really depressing, I just really wanted to get this off my chest. I'm new to Reddit so might as well, you know?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain. the author describes their birthday as a yearly reminder of their lack of genuine friendships, highlighting a feeling of being engulfed in loneliness. the contrast between how others might view birthdays and the author's negative perception of them further underscores their emotional distress. phrases like ""absolute loneliness"" and ""the feeling of truly living is unbeknownst to me"" are strong indicators of a profound sense of disconnection and despair. the act of sharing these feelings on a public forum suggests a yearning for connection and understanding, common in individuals experiencing loneliness."
"How long do you think you can realistically continue this way?All I've known is loneliness. My entire life has been filled with sadness, abandonment, lonliness, decpetion, and disappointment. I've given it a good honest go at change and taking in an extra handful of hope thinking I'm just being down on myself. As I'm reaching my mid 30s now I would say that it's fairly apparent what my life is meant to be. I'm at a loss and horrified that what I never wanted to happen clearly is my fate. At this point, I feel like I'm just trying to see how long I can last.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of despair and resignation, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual recounts a life filled with sadness, abandonment, deception, and disappointment, all of which contribute to feelings of isolation. the mention of making an effort to change and hold onto hope suggests a struggle against these feelings, but the ultimate sense of hopelessness and acceptance of a lonely fate indicates a profound level of emotional distress. the narrative also reveals a lack of social support and a pervasive feeling of being misunderstood or overlooked, which are common experiences among those who feel lonely. the overall tone of the narrative, marked by phrases like ""all i've known is loneliness"" and ""i am at a loss,"" underscores the depth of the individual's emotional pain and sense of isolation."
"I have no one to talk to about my lonelinessCausing me to feel even more lonely, wanting to talk about it, only realizing that no one gives a fuck about me and I have no one to talk to about, causing me to feel... 

And the cycle continues",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. the repetitive nature of the individual's thoughts indicates a cycle of loneliness that perpetuates itself. phrases like ""i have no one to talk to"" and ""no one gives a fuck about me"" are direct expressions of feeling disconnected and unsupported. the emphasis on the desire to talk but having no one to listen highlights the absence of social connections, which is a significant indicator of loneliness. the cyclical pattern of feeling lonely, wanting to talk, and realizing there's no one to confide in exacerbates the sense of isolation, making it clear that the individual is trapped in a loop of loneliness. this narrative encapsulates the essence of loneliness through the lack of meaningful interactions and the emotional pain stemming from social isolation."
"I have friends, but I still have nobody to talk to.As said in the title I??ve always had friends, but I??ve never been anyone??s first choice. I remember a few years ago when I was playing a game online with an old friend of mine and we were both having a great time. Then he said he had to get ready for work the next day. I said bye and continued playing a different game. When I was getting off about 45 minutes later I saw him online in a game with 2 of my other friends. I kinda just sat there and accepted it before getting some rest. This has been a recurring event in my life. Whenever I was invited to party??s or just to hang out as a kid it was almost always in a group, and it seems like I was only invited because they had space they wanted to use. 

I just feel like I don??t have anyone I??m close to anymore because I??ve avoided any new friendships and talk to the least amount of people possible now. My dreams have turned into regular scenarios in an office space or just normal social encounters. 

I just needed some space to say this to get it out there. Sorry for the long post.",1,"the narrative reflects feelings of loneliness despite having friends, which is a key indicator of emotional isolation. the author mentions consistently feeling like a secondary choice, which can significantly impact one's sense of belonging and self-worth. the specific example of seeing friends play without them after saying goodbye highlights the recurring theme of exclusion. this pattern of being included only when convenient for others reinforces the perception of not being truly valued. the avoidance of new friendships and limited social interactions further suggest a withdrawal stemming from past experiences of rejection. the dreams described, which lack meaningful connections, mirror the author's real-life social disconnection. the need to express these feelings in a public forum indicates a search for validation and understanding, common among those experiencing loneliness."
"I don't relate to peopleI have no friends. After another failed first date on via tinder I am now convinced I will never relate to someone. I feel like an alien to people. I don't like the same things, my sense of humor is odd, I'm a weirdo. I have never found anyone who I can completely be myself with, and I don't think anybody out there wants that from me. I'm convinced my date made up an excuse to leave early. I have nothing to offer. I have always been the friend you have at work/school but never outside of those confines. There's something about me that people can just tell is off. I have no qualities worthy of friendship. I will die alone in my own arms. It's all a big nothing.",1,"the narrative reveals deep feelings of social isolation and self-doubt, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses a sense of alienation, feeling fundamentally different from others, and struggles to connect on a personal level. the repeated failed attempts at dating and the belief that no one will ever understand or accept them highlight a pervasive sense of rejection. the narrative also shows a lack of self-worth, as the individual perceives themselves as having no qualities that are valued in friendships. the idea of dying alone underscores a profound fear of perpetual solitude. these elements collectively illustrate the writer's intense experience of loneliness."

"Sophomore in college with no close friends...It's a Saturday night and I'm sitting in my room by myself... I'm in my second year of college and I'm surrounded by acquaintances but no close friends.

I was best friends with my roommate and 2 other girls on my floor freshman year until my roommate began to bully me and they took her side.

I joined a club sport and have a friend ""group"" that I get together with once in awhile but don't hang out with them regularly. When I do spend time with them, I feel like I'm being invited out of obligation and no one really talks to me/they don't want me there.

I joined a professional sorority- I'm even on the executive board. I have lots of acquaintances there too, but they have their own groups and I don't get invited to hang out with them. I've made plans with some of them but I'm always the one initiating things.

I moved into an apartment with 2 other people, and they're really good friends with each other. I knew that from the start, but I didn't think they would pretend I didn't exist.

I have a boyfriend but we're in a long-distance relationship so I only see him on breaks.

I want to go to the football games but I don't because I have no one to go with. I'll probably be spending my birthday alone next month. People say that you should wait for friendships to magically happen- well, I've been waiting for a really long time and I'm sick of it.

I feel lonely even when I'm with people[removed],1,"the narrative reflects a common experience of loneliness, where an individual feels isolated despite being surrounded by others. this phenomenon can be indicative of a deeper sense of emotional disconnection and lack of meaningful relationships. phrases like ""i feel lonely even when i am with people"" suggest that the presence of others does not alleviate the feeling of loneliness, highlighting an internal struggle rather than a mere lack of social interaction. such feelings are often associated with unmet emotional needs, a sense of not being understood or valued, and possibly underlying issues such as low self-esteem or depression. these indicators are crucial in understanding the complexity of loneliness, which is not solely about physical solitude but more about the quality of social connections and emotional fulfillment."

Thank you for reading.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and despair. the author expresses difficulty in communicating their feelings and experiences, noting that their attempts to connect with others, including professionals, friends, and family, have been met with dismissal or criticism. this consistent lack of validation and understanding can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the pervasive sense of inadequacy and failure mentioned throughout the narrative further underscores their emotional struggle. the author’s fear of perpetual solitude, lack of meaningful relationships, and potential for a future devoid of companionship or achievement are strong indicators of loneliness. these fears reflect a profound sense of disconnection and hopelessness about their social prospects. the narrative also touches on feelings of invisibility and being a burden, which are common in individuals experiencing loneliness. these elements collectively highlight the author’s deep-seated feelings of isolation and their yearning for meaningful connection and recognition."
"LonelyI've moved 5 schools and now I'm in college, and for the first time in my life I've truly have no friends.All the chats with the few friends i had from school have become me sending some meme or song and waiting for a reply which never comes and because I didn't spend much time in college due to the pandemic and my introversion,I didn't make friends there.I'm in a bad place in my life along with every sphere of my life fucked.",1,"the narrative describes a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions moving schools multiple times and now being in college, yet for the first time, they feel truly friendless. this history of frequent transitions can disrupt the formation of stable, long-term relationships, contributing to feelings of loneliness. the person also describes one-sided interactions with former friends, where their attempts at communication go unanswered, further emphasizing their sense of social isolation. the lack of new friendships in college, exacerbated by the pandemic and their introverted nature, compounds their feelings of loneliness. additionally, the mention of being in a bad place in life and feeling that every aspect of their life is troubled reflects a broader sense of despair and lack of support, which are often associated with loneliness. these elements collectively highlight the pervasive sense of isolation and disconnection the individual is experiencing."
I realized how lonely I am when I was sickI couldn't really get out of bed and I went through my contacts I realized there wasnt anyone I could call or ask help for. I'd say I'm pretty social and have plenty of friends but i don't think I could bother them. I called my SO and just got told to be better soon...  even though I have family and friends I'm alone.,1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness despite the presence of social connections. the individual describes a moment of vulnerability when they were sick and unable to get out of bed, which is a critical time when support is most needed. the act of going through contacts and realizing there wasn't anyone they felt comfortable asking for help indicates a lack of perceived emotional support. even though they identify as social and having plenty of friends, the hesitation to reach out suggests a deeper sense of isolation. the response from their significant other, who merely wished them well without offering tangible support, further exacerbates their feelings of being alone. the statement ""even though i have family and friends i am alone"" underscores the emotional disconnect and the profound sense of loneliness that isn't alleviated by the mere presence of social relationships. this narrative highlights the discrepancy between having social contacts and feeling genuinely supported and connected, which are typical indicators of loneliness."
"It doesn??t get betterI??ve spent my entire 26 years as an adult (I am 44) with the wrong two partners.  The last one I was with for a long time didn??t want me to have friends.  Some I eradicated were honestly for the best.  Some weren??t.  Now I??m alone.  I am great at making friends, but I put zero effort into anyone anymore.  I feel like people are not worth the time, but I am also sad to be alone.  My kids are my friends and that??s stupid.  I am probably a burden.  Is this just depression rearing its head again?   Solitude is so delightful, but horribly addictive.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional turmoil. the individual reflects on their past relationships, noting that their partners had a negative impact on their social connections, which contributed to their current state of loneliness. the acknowledgment of being good at making friends but choosing not to invest effort into relationships suggests a withdrawal from social interactions, a common sign of loneliness. the conflicting feelings of finding solace in solitude while also recognizing its detrimental effects highlight the complexity of their emotional state. the mention of feeling like a burden and questioning if their experience is tied to depression further underscores the depth of their loneliness. the reliance on their children for companionship, which they self-criticize, points to a lack of adult peer support and an internal struggle with their social worth. overall, the narrative captures the essence of loneliness through the individual's past relational experiences, current social disengagement, and the emotional conflict they face."
"I only have online friends, and I am desperately touched starvedI even feel alone when I am messaging them, it's weird. We have to have a deep conversation for it to have any meaning to me. And oh god do I miss touching other people, as weird as that sounds. I'm at the point where I'm just gonna try and find a one night stand to fill the void.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects significant indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions having only online friends, which can contribute to feelings of isolation due to the lack of physical presence and real-life interaction. the expression of being ""desperately touch starved"" highlights a deep need for physical contact and connection, which is a fundamental human need often unmet in lonely individuals. the fact that they feel alone even while messaging their online friends suggests that these interactions are not fulfilling their emotional needs. the mention of needing deep conversations for any interaction to feel meaningful indicates a yearning for more substantial and intimate connections, which are often lacking in the lives of lonely people. finally, the contemplation of seeking a one night stand to fill the void underscores a sense of desperation and the extent of their loneliness, as they are willing to engage in potentially unfulfilling or risky behavior just to experience some form of human connection. these elements combined paint a clear picture of someone experiencing profound loneliness."

Hopefully I get some people because I do be lonely at work and during the day so hmu if anything is interesting",1,"the narrative reveals a clear desire for social interaction and companionship, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions feeling lonely at work and during the day, highlighting a sense of isolation in their daily life. their openness to talking about various interests, such as anime and gaming, suggests an eagerness to connect with others on shared hobbies, which is often a coping mechanism for loneliness. the offer to be a supportive presence for others, like being a shoulder to lean on, further underscores their longing for meaningful connections. the informal and somewhat pleading tone of the message reflects a deep-seated need for social bonds, reinforcing the psychological insight that loneliness often drives people to seek out new relationships and support systems."
"Anyone else literally friendless?It recently dawned on me (20M) that I genuinely have no friends nowadays.

When I was younger, I wasn??t very popular but I had a close circle of friends. As the years went on we drifted apart and now I don??t think I could relate to them anymore. I made a few friends in my first year at university, but in the second year my mental health deteriorated and I basically cut myself off from everyone in my life. I failed most of my classes that year, and I??ve taken this year off, but I??ve been allowed to retake them in September. 

At the moment I??m back in my hometown with only my family for company (and I barely leave the house because of the COVID lockdown). I??ve never felt more lonely.

Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to get this off my chest, and thought maybe some people here might relate.

TL;DR: I??ve cut myself from all of my friends, and am worried I??ll be alone forever now",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and disconnection. the author reflects on their past, noting a shift from having a close circle of friends to feeling entirely friendless. this progression highlights a significant loss of social connections, a key indicator of loneliness. the author’s mental health struggles, which led to self-isolation and academic difficulties, further compound their sense of being cut off from others. the covid lockdown exacerbates their isolation, as they are confined to their hometown with limited social interactions. the expression of worry about being alone forever and the desire to find others who can relate underscores their deep sense of loneliness. these elements—loss of friends, self-isolation, deteriorating mental health, and the impact of external circumstances—are all typical indicators of loneliness."
"Every week im falling apart when im alone, sometimes i was near to destory my lifenan",1,"the narrative indicates a profound sense of loneliness and emotional distress. the phrase ""every week im falling apart when im alone"" suggests a recurring pattern of emotional breakdowns specifically triggered by solitude, which is a strong indicator of loneliness. the use of ""falling apart"" conveys a sense of losing control and feeling overwhelmed, which are common feelings associated with loneliness. additionally, the mention of being ""near to destroy my life"" points to severe despair and possible suicidal ideation, further emphasizing the depth of the individual's loneliness and emotional pain. these expressions of ongoing emotional turmoil and the critical impact of being alone are clear signs that the individual is struggling with significant loneliness."
"Currently overseas and its crushing my spirit.My state??s National Guard got activated for a deployment, at first I thought it was a just another rumor. Their had been talks for the two years that I had been in but never anything concrete and it always felt like it was going to get canceled, but this time it was real and I was going.

And whenever we go out, all these guys want to do is drink and I??m not a big social drinker so I just stay in, and I??m weird for that. I just feel so trapped and I  hate it here and all I want is for this to be over with as soon as possible so I can go back to my regular life.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and disconnection. the author describes being overseas and feeling their spirit crushed, indicating a deep emotional strain. the deployment, which they did not volunteer for, has forced them to leave behind a job they enjoy and delay their education, contributing to a sense of loss and sacrifice. the mention of not getting along with their section and merely tolerating each other highlights a lack of meaningful social connections. the longing for privacy and the discomfort of being around people constantly further emphasize their sense of alienation. their avoidance of social drinking and the perception of being seen as ""weird"" for it underscores their feeling of not fitting in. overall, the narrative paints a picture of someone feeling trapped, disconnected from their surroundings, and yearning for the comfort and normalcy of their previous life, all of which are strong indicators of loneliness."

Very lonely.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and difficulty in finding like-minded individuals. the author feels disconnected from those around her, who either engage in relaxed, common hobbies or are highly ambitious, neither of which resonate with her. the repeated mention of loneliness and the emphasis on being on a ""lonely path"" highlight her feelings of being misunderstood and not fitting in with societal norms. this lack of connection and the struggle to find people with similar interests are strong indicators of loneliness. her narrative reflects the emotional pain and the sense of being an outlier in social contexts, which are classic signs of experiencing loneliness."
Had a thought while listening to a deep song of me looking down a bridge. I really don??t want to have dark thoughts like this anymore because it can make me tear up. Worst part is that I have no one to talk to outside of my phone.nan,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress. the individual describes experiencing dark thoughts and a lack of emotional support, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the mention of listening to a deep song and looking down a bridge suggests a moment of introspection and vulnerability. the most telling aspect is the admission of having no one to talk to outside of their phone, highlighting a lack of meaningful, in-person social connections. this sense of having no supportive network to share their feelings with can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and contribute to their emotional struggles."
"Always sad and always lonelyI've always been a lonely kid. I grew up an only child and very shy, I opened up a bit more in high school, but never went to parties or had many friends. I thought when I got to college things would be different, and they were, for a very small time. I made really close friends quickly, got invited to parties, had my first kiss, lost my virginity, etc. But I feel so alone and so sad all the time. I constantly feel like no one wants to actually be around me and it causes me to push people away and I hate it. I started to feel better when hanging out with this guy, but he messed with my head a lot and I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough for anyone. I'm scared I'll never be loved and that I'll never find my ""person"", I try to talk to my friends about this but they just don't get it. They're confident, good at sports, pretty, fit, have friends, get along with people, and constantly get hit on or dm'd by guys/girls on instagram or snapchat. They keep telling me I deserve better than the guy that hurt me, but I finally snapped and told them how I feel, how there's no one that's interested in me and it shows. Each one went dead quiet after this. I just don't know how to feel better about myself, or even if I can at this point. I'm scared that if I don't change then I'll just keep pushing people away and become more closed off than I already am.",1,"the narrative describes a deep and persistent sense of loneliness that has been a part of the individual's life since childhood. growing up as an only child and being very shy contributed to early feelings of isolation. although there was a brief period in college where the individual experienced positive social interactions, these were not enough to alleviate the underlying loneliness. the person feels perpetually sad and believes that others do not genuinely want to be around them, leading to self-sabotaging behaviors like pushing people away. the relationship with a guy who manipulated their emotions exacerbated their feelings of inadequacy and fear of never being loved. the individual's friends, who seem to lead more socially successful lives, are unable to understand or empathize with these feelings, further isolating the person. the fear of not being able to change and the potential for becoming even more closed off are strong indicators of chronic loneliness and self-doubt."
Lonely ????Hey does anyone wanna talk I really don't wanna be alone tonight...,1,"the narrative clearly expresses a desire for social interaction and a fear of being alone, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the use of the word ""lonely"" right at the beginning sets the tone for the entire message. the urgency in the plea ""does anyone wanna talk"" suggests a deep need for connection and companionship. phrases like ""i really do not wanna be alone tonight"" highlight the individual's discomfort with solitude and their yearning for immediate social contact. these elements collectively point to feelings of loneliness, as the person is actively seeking out others to fill an emotional void. the repetitive and somewhat desperate nature of the request further underscores the emotional distress typically associated with loneliness."

This level of loneliness and really feeling empty makes me wanna go back to her. The only reason ?? broke up with her was because it was international. I mean very long distance.

Pls tell me ??f this is not fiting here and at least suggest me a proper sub to post this.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of loneliness, which are evident through the author's expressions of emotional pain and longing for connection. the individual describes a significant sense of isolation following a breakup that occurred almost a year ago, indicating that the passage of time has not alleviated their loneliness. they mention that everything they see or do serves as a reminder of their solitary state, exacerbated by the pandemic, which has limited opportunities for social interaction and meeting new people. the narrative also highlights a decline in self-esteem, making it difficult for the author to engage in simple social activities like texting without anxiety about making mistakes. this self-doubt and the feeling of emptiness drive them to consider rekindling a past relationship despite acknowledging its impracticality due to distance. the author’s regret over their decision to end the relationship and their desire for any semblance of companionship underscore their profound loneliness. their plea for guidance on where to share their feelings further emphasizes their desperation for connection and support. these elements collectively illustrate the classic indicators of loneliness, such as longing for past relationships, social withdrawal, low self-esteem, and an intense desire for human connection."
"Can I get a happy birthday? Spending my 23rd birthday alone tomorrow just like last year. I??m so dreading it.I really don??t want to self pity. Two people who live half a world away remembered.

"Ghosted by my friend for her own mental health but dayuum it hurts.This last year has been tough for everyone crap actually the last 18 months at this rate.. I lost my home me and my daughter were made homeless because my marriage of 17 years took a violent turn during lockdown #1.. I needed my friend.the only friend my husband allowed beacaue she lived so far away. She was almost happy when we split.telling me he was no good anyway blah blah, she been single 16 years and she's happily single so not a jealousy issue. 
I know she's Ill drs don't know why she's ill she just is. I love her through all her and I'm gonna say it pity party's she has or had, she was justified in being and feeling sorry for herself but on her birthday last year I texted her a happy birthday and got no reply. I figured she's busy having a good day ( I was at the time in a hostel with my daughter and working trying to get our life back on track) so sent her a few random standard it's your birthday texts etcetc and at the end of the day she sent a standard to everyone message 
It went along the lines of you all messaged me and I didn't want to be reminded of my birthday you all ignored my wishes to ignore my birthday I need space no one contact me anymore.... Ikr I felt awful if I hadn't at least messaged her she may have regretted not wanting her birthday mentioned but I didn't know her family would text her and wish her a happy birthday too.
Now in her defense she had told me she didn't want a birthday as it marked a year since her illness and a lack of diagnosis but c'mon a text from your bestie?? Wouldn't hurt right.well apparently it did. I figured she meant party or family gathering or something not a bloody text.
I've messed her, called her, written to her ( a funny card) done everything but visit because il be honest I'm angry 
This last year I needed a friend! A friendship is two ways? I needed a shoulder to cry on I needed a friend to help me out of the dark places my mind went... and nothing! She's ghosted everyone and now I'm feeling a little like fuck you then. I know her mental health is t great but damn girl we can't fix you if you don't at least try. She always has an issue as to why she can't make the changes she needs to help herself but like..  there's only so much outside help can offer and my life took that 180 turn so I've been a little busy.. what do I do? Go see her finally? Message her keep messaging her telling her I love her and respect her need to be alone etcetc. I resent her for ditching me when I needed her. But I want my friend back. Perhaps I should have of ignored her on her birthday but il be honest chances are shed have been all depressed because no one messaged her (she's weird like that) it's always about her... But I get that she's had to look after herself for so long but mehh.
Perhaps im selfish for wanting a friend so badly? 
I'm just venting in the hope someone will possibly tell me what they would do,..

Much love xx",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of emotional turmoil and isolation. the author describes significant life disruptions, including homelessness and a violent end to a long-term marriage, which are major stressors that often exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the loss of a close friend, especially under such painful circumstances, further intensifies this loneliness. the friend's decision to cut off contact, despite the author's desperate need for support, leaves the author feeling abandoned and resentful. the author expresses a longing for the friend's companionship and struggles with feelings of rejection and helplessness, typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative also reflects a pattern of seeking validation and support from others, yet feeling consistently let down, which underscores the author's isolation. overall, the combination of life challenges, the breakdown of a crucial supportive relationship, and the emotional pain of feeling unsupported and alone are clear indicators of loneliness in this narrative."

"Feeling aloneJust really alone. I realized, likely not for the first time, that I've been hiding from everyone. Not hiding as in not showing myself, but in not showing my true self.

That's an exaggeration of course, but I do feel closed off and unable to really trust or connect with anyone.

And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm afraid to hope for a real connection. I'm aware that I'm a downer and I have a very grim view of the world, but I think that's because I'm afraid to see it as anything else.

I haven't been in love. I haven't lost someone to death. So it's not like I'm speaking from a place of great pain and fear. But I am in pain nonetheless. And if the demo version of pain hurts this much, I fear that nothing lies out there for me except for a broken heart or a broken neck.

I uh... don't really know what else to say. I forgot, actually, having been distracted by what I already wrote. But yeah, this is how I feel.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional disconnection. the individual describes feeling alone and hiding their true self from others, which indicates a lack of genuine, intimate connections. the mention of compartmentalization suggests an inability to integrate their identity across different social contexts, leading to feelings of being misunderstood or unknown by those around them. the fear of hoping for a real connection and the acknowledgment of a grim worldview further underscore their sense of hopelessness and emotional withdrawal. despite not having experienced significant losses, the person expresses an ongoing pain, suggesting that their loneliness is more about a pervasive emotional state rather than specific events. the narrative conveys a deep-seated fear of future emotional pain, reinforcing their current sense of isolation and despair. overall, these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, characterized by emotional isolation, fear of vulnerability, and a bleak outlook on relationships and the future."
"Loneliness leading to crazy thoughtsI??ve got to the point in life where I??m 32 shortly, I??ve got no real friends. I??ve started going to massage parlours to spend 30 mins to 1 hour with a woman for company. I don??t even want any sexual services I just want to talk.

I??m now considering whether to pay a prostitute or escort to spend a night with me. Again, not even for anything sexual. I just want someone, anyone to sleep next to me.

I dated one woman for 6-7 years and she cheated on me and got pregnant to another guy, so she left me. And the next woman I dated for 1 year was actually a massage ??lady?? who decided she wanted to go back into that life where strangers pay her for sexual favours, so she left me.

I??m almost embarrassed at my thoughts and situation.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and desperation for human connection. the individual explicitly mentions a lack of real friends and a reliance on massage parlours simply for companionship, which underscores a deep-seated need for social interaction. the consideration of paying for non-sexual companionship, such as spending a night with an escort just to have someone nearby, further highlights the extent of their loneliness. past relationships marked by betrayal and abandonment have exacerbated their feelings of loneliness, leading to a heightened desire for physical and emotional closeness. the individual's self-awareness of their situation and feelings of embarrassment also indicate a recognition of their loneliness, which adds to their emotional burden. these elements collectively illustrate a person grappling with significant loneliness and seeking any form of human connection to alleviate their sense of isolation."

I am stronger, definitely not unstable, and feel as though I am returning to the old me but I don't want the old me to be so drab. I need friends, someone to remind me that I have a reason to be happy just by talking normally to them, making small talk with someone who I love and am grateful for is something I fantasize about.

I know I can keep a happy relationship now but who would want to be friends with this. my 'ex' wanted nothing to do with me after he saw me change, even after asking to stay friends and texting quite a lot.

Well the bit that's bothering me most is my husband has to go back to the office for 3 days a week from now, while I still wfh. For the office days, he wants to sleep over at his mums as the commute would be cut in half. But it means I'm totally alone for 3 days a week. Except for my cats. Yes I'm sure he's not cheating but I do feel it's weird he's happy to cut our time almost in half just for some convenience. Then again I also really hate commuting so I can understand him. I've said I'm lonely and miss him to him, but not asked him to stay here in our home. I feel like that'd be controlling and he probably would say no anyway. 

So what can I do? Just post on reddit and really hope someone talks? Cling to my husband or parents via phone?

i??m lonely because i don??t feel connected to anyone beyond a surface level. i??ve been told, oh you just haven??t met the right people. and while *maybe* that??s true, it seems unlikely. because i??ve met alottt of different kinds of people. but the common factor in all my interactions seems to be me. if every single things play out the same way, it has to be me as the problem. it makes me feel like a shit person. and like i am self centered and a bad person. and maybe that is the truth. idk. but i don??t really even know how to fix it. i don??t even know if anything i said makes sense but i hope so.

Some of them were of the opposite sex??guys who ended up having feelings for me that I didn??t reciprocate, and then there was a guy who I ended up having feelings for that he didn??t reciprocate. (We stayed really close friends for a couple years though until he got a girlfriend and almost immediately fell out of touch.)

So unfortunately a lot of the most fun, intense, and fulfilling friendships I??ve had over the years have faded away almost entirely outside of a friendly check in every few months, or a passing comment on social media. 

What I??m left with are friends who I??m in frequent contact with??but who don??t really bring out the best in me, or the truest part of me. I tend to get along best with warm, kind, fun-loving people. But most of my current friends are on the colder, snarky side. Not in touch with emotions or verbally affectionate, and tend to complain and be overly critical of others. And when I??m with them I find it hard not to mirror that attitude. 

Anyway, I feel like I??m in a social rut and not just because it??s a pandemic. I??m worried that the older we get, the more rare good friend chemistry becomes.

Does anyone else feel like this? Or know some magic way to change it?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of longing for meaningful connections and highlights the author's feelings of disconnection and dissatisfaction with their current social circle. the author reminisces about past friendships that were fulfilling and vibrant but have since faded due to life changes such as marriage, relocation, and unreciprocated romantic feelings. the current friendships described lack emotional warmth and fail to bring out the best in the author, contributing to a sense of being in a social rut. the mention of mirroring negative attitudes of current friends suggests a struggle to maintain authenticity and emotional well-being. the worry about the rarity of good friend chemistry as one ages further underscores feelings of isolation and concern about future social fulfillment. these elements are indicative of loneliness, as the author is not only missing the deep connections they once had but also feels stuck in unsatisfying relationships without a clear path to change."
"Depression has caused me to isolate myself and I don't know how to reach back out (cw depression)I've been pretty depressed for the last month, some of the worst of my life, I am safe though.

At the time I knew it wasn't healthy but it genuinely felt the best way to protect them and I was struggling to keep messaging. My friends have stopped messaging and reaching out which is entirely fair and my own fault but now I'm unsure how to start things again.  How do I reach back out? Would they even want to talk to me? What if they've realised that space from me was actually better? What if no one will forgive me?

I know the longer I wait the harder it'll be.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and self-doubt, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a recent period of severe depression, leading to self-imposed isolation from friends. the feelings of being a burden and the fear that their presence could negatively impact their friends are common thoughts among those experiencing loneliness. the person's uncertainty about how to reconnect, coupled with worries about being forgiven or welcomed back, further emphasizes their sense of disconnection and loneliness. the struggle between not wanting to bring friends down and the need for support highlights the internal conflict and exacerbates feelings of loneliness. the narrative's focus on the difficulty of re-establishing connections and the fear of permanent isolation are clear indicators of the individual's loneliness."
"when i say i have no friends, i literally mean it.nan",1,"the narrative reveals a stark admission of social isolation, which is a key indicator of loneliness. the phrase ""i have no friends"" is a direct and unequivocal statement that highlights a lack of social connections, which is often associated with feelings of loneliness. the use of the word ""literally"" emphasizes the severity and reality of the situation, suggesting that this is not an exaggeration but a true reflection of the individual's social circumstances. this kind of straightforward acknowledgment of friendlessness is a strong sign of loneliness, as friendships and social interactions are fundamental to human emotional well-being. the absence of any mitigating factors or additional context that might suggest a temporary or voluntary situation further supports the interpretation that the individual is experiencing loneliness."
"It's hard for to connect with world when you don't follow the rules of society.Apologies for the long post. I'm honestly a man of many words. Here's a TLDR however.

TLDR: I'm the kind who is open-minded and sincere with the way I live, but sadly the world isn't made for that.

With all modesty, I am a very sincere person in a cynical world. Nearly everyone's always out for something, in for something and would do anything for what they want and like.

I honestly tried understanding the world but I just can't keep up. I'm different from everyone else, I don't follow the rules of society and if I describe with a quote it would be ""I reject your reality and substitute my own."" - Adam Savage. 

When other people chase trends, I sit in my room enjoying what I already have. When other people try hard to get good at what they do, I just take things slow and improve over time. When others seek revenge, I seek forgiveness. When others hate, I love. When other people choose their friends based on interests, I open mindedly open up to anyone regardless of hobbies. You get the point by now.

I could honestly just not care about what others think but it's to keep doing that when the world isn't do encouraging. People always expect the worse out of others. To them, altruism is a fairytale and no one is like that. Well news flash, I am, and you would see that if you give the time to understand.

I've been in many hard spots and lost friendships simply because I don't follow the conventions of the world. 

One example would be a friend of mine (well, ex-gf actually) who in her pursuit to fit in with a certain game community and etc. started to become toxic and I suspect could be the general toxicity of the internet rubbing off on her. I tried what I could, I talked to mutual friends and ""enemies"" (who apparently are actually decent people who just got on her bad side). She took it the worng way and called me a manipulating traitor and believed I was trying to ruin her rather than fix her unbeknownst toxicity.

It's really hypocritical. Society loves to uphold inspirational messages like ""Be yourself"" or ""Do your best"" but when you actually do it the same society would reject you. Everyday I just wish that the world of was at least kinder but a guy can dream. Despite that, I'm still holding on, hoping that I can get my break. Hence my favorite word ""Wildheart"" which means ""someone who keeps hoping and loving desipte all the hardships""",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of disconnection from societal norms and the struggle to fit in with the world around. the author describes feeling different from others, emphasizing their open-mindedness and sincerity in contrast to what they perceive as a cynical and trend-chasing society. this sense of being misunderstood and not fitting in is a common indicator of loneliness. the recounting of lost friendships, particularly the detailed example of the ex-girlfriend who misunderstood their intentions, further highlights the isolation and difficulty in forming lasting, meaningful connections. the author's yearning for a kinder world and their identification with the term ""wildheart"" signify a persistent hope despite the loneliness they experience. the narrative is imbued with a sense of longing for acceptance and understanding, which are typical psychological markers of loneliness."
"Ghosted... again""Put yourself out there,"" well I did and it kept blowing up in my face. People just hate me man.",1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of rejection and frustration, which are common indicators of loneliness. phrases like ""ghosted... again"" and ""people just hate me man"" suggest repeated experiences of being ignored or abandoned, leading to feelings of isolation and unworthiness. the use of ""again"" implies a pattern of negative social interactions, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the individual's effort to ""put yourself out there"" indicates a desire for connection, yet the repeated failure to establish meaningful relationships intensifies their sense of loneliness. such expressions of persistent social rejection and the emotional toll it takes are strong indicators of an underlying struggle with loneliness."
"Anybody else like me?Well, where to start?
It's obviously hard to have nobody to talk to and being the lonely kid in class. But sometimes all I fucking feel is like having someone talk to, give me a hug, talk to me. Had a lot of friends back in the time before this pandemic thing, but isolation made me realise that friendship like that really had no meaning, just stayed with them, everybody had their own friends and I was the only one left. I thought I had many friends but turned out they were all acquaintance. Had 2 friends recently, but now with time, I am the one left out, they stay with themselves, and they try to seclude me from their conversation, and like before I can't really can't go upto people forcing them to talk to me. Liked this girl a lot, first time actually liked a girl and wanted to have some realtionship, but couldn't even talk to her and well now she has moved into a town, so can't even do anything now.

I feel fucking miserable upon myself, not doing anything's, having thousand of things in my mind, listening to music all day, and sleep being my best friend.  It's easy to tell for others to go out and talk but it's not. What I have understood is? We all are lonely deep inside but most won't express it to others and stay with themselves acting all strong, only if we lonely people could help each other out but no we all are busy and won't move out of our circle, only of some of us actually want to talk and be with others except knowing most of us are lonely.

I just want someone to talk to and take care of me, I can live alone and that's 100%age true, but I don't enjoy it. This thing has been moving into me since a year, should have done something back then, but all I feel like is a void inside. I understand people have trauma inside, and feel that sometime. But nothing remarkable has happened to me, that makes me sad and lonely, but still I am fighting the demons in my head.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and yearning for connection. the individual describes being the ""lonely kid in class"" and expresses a deep desire for someone to talk to and give them a hug. the loss of meaningful friendships during the pandemic highlights the individual's realization that their past social connections were superficial. the sense of being left out by recent friends and the inability to approach others for conversation further exacerbates their loneliness. the unfulfilled romantic interest and the subsequent feeling of helplessness contribute to their misery. the narrative reveals a struggle with internal demons and a pervasive feeling of emptiness, despite acknowledging that others may also experience loneliness but choose to hide it. the individual's reliance on music and sleep as coping mechanisms underscores their attempt to escape from their feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative captures the essence of someone deeply affected by loneliness, marked by a longing for genuine human connection and an ongoing battle with their inner turmoil."

"This is what I feel about my parents?? decision to move overseasDisappointed in my parents decision, but respect it

Here goes, I am 18 years of age and am currently living in the US. I was born and raised in Singapore and attended primary school and two years of secondary school before moving over to the US when I was 14.

&amp;#x200B;

 You see, because I left Singapore when I was so young the only real friends I have in Singapore are from my short time in secondary school (2 years) which means that I only have about 5 close friends in the country that I plan to settle in in the future. I do not talk to anyone from my Primary/elemantary school anymore and I'm sure this is true for most of you guys too. This absolutely sucks because all of those friends who are now 18 and have been studying in Singapore their whole life managed to form so many different friend groups and meet so many people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My time in the US was no better either. I went to one high school in the US with a student body of \~70 kids. That means that I only have so many people I can ultimately form strong bonds with. And during my 3-4 years in the US, I have made only about 2 \*moderately\* close friends. I know that in 5 years when I'm living in Singapore I will lose contact with everyone I met in the US, because 

&amp;#x200B;

1) of geographical location

2) I simply did not manage to form much very good friendships

&amp;#x200B;

If only I lived and studied in Singapore for a longer period of time, maybe I could have made more Singaporean friends, which is particularly important because I plan to continue living there once I return from the US. And being in a city with few friends is definitely not the best thing that can happen.

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, I did not have a choice. My father was struggling to find work in Singapore and had to relocate and I could not protest his decision. I love them but the fact that it impacted me by basically cutting me out from making friends in a country I want to live in really sucks. I also find myself more comfortable around Singaporeans  than Americans because of the cultural differences, so our relocation to the states was very difficult for me. I don't want to hurt my parents' feelings so here I am, complaining on Reddit. Anyone with children planning to migrate to a place vastly different, hear me out. Please take your child's social life into consideration too. You do not want them to end up with major difficulties in their long-term social life.

Might end up lonely when I return there in the future.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection stemming from the individual's experiences of moving between countries during formative years. the author expresses disappointment and a sense of loss over missed opportunities to form lasting friendships in singapore, a place they consider home and plan to return to. they lament the limited social connections made in the us, exacerbated by the small student body at their high school and cultural differences that made integration challenging. the concern about future loneliness upon returning to singapore highlights a fear of enduring social isolation due to the lack of established relationships. the narrative conveys a longing for a stable social network and the pain of feeling disconnected from both past and present communities, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author’s internal conflict between respecting their parents' decision and the personal impact it had on their social life further underscores their feelings of isolation and the struggle to find a sense of belonging."
"I??m tired of being this tiredEvery time I think it??s okay to let my guard down and open up to someone, I get hurt. I??m so exhausted. I can??t do it anymore. I have to start living my life accepting the fact that I am alone. I do not have anyone and I do not have the capacity to keep getting hurt. 

But I??m just not comfortable being alone yet. Every night I get so sad from the loneliness that I cry myself to sleep. If I don??t want to cry, I??ll pour myself into work. But I can??t work constantly. I have to do something beyond that and work on myself.

So my question for everyone is how do you do that? How can I get comfortable being alone? How can I work on myself? How can I grow as a person? I??m tired of being this tired with myself.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of exhaustion and emotional pain stemming from repeated experiences of hurt when trying to form connections with others. the author expresses a clear recognition of their loneliness, highlighting their struggle with accepting solitude and the sadness it brings, which often leads to crying themselves to sleep. their reliance on work as a distraction is a common coping mechanism, yet they acknowledge its limitations and express a desire for personal growth and self-improvement. the repeated questioning of how to become comfortable being alone and how to work on themselves underscores their awareness of their loneliness and their yearning for change. these aspects—persistent sadness, crying due to loneliness, and the quest for self-betterment—are typical indicators of loneliness and illustrate the depth of the author’s emotional struggle."
"I??m fucking sick of itYeah, I??m pretty young and still have a ways to go, but my brain doesn??t care. I just need someone. I can??t go to school because literally everyone has friends and partners, and I??m the outcast that gets noticed when someone needs money/help. I have 2 people I??d call my friends, one of which never has the time to hang out, the other has an abusive mother and visits her dads on the weekends. My depression is killing me (almost literally at this point) and it weighs me down so much I struggle to go to school. My mom has to go to court because I??ve missed so much of it. We??ve had a parent-teacher conference for me but I couldn??t open up and still can??t. I hate being bothersome, I hate making people worry, I hate that I have a brain. I??m supposed to be ??the good child??, the one with a future but that??s definitely not happening. I keep getting praised as ??kind??, ??smart??, ??good looking??, but I hate having people praise me for something I don??t put to use. I??ve never really had any more than 2/3 friends at any point in my life, had a ??girlfriend?? once, who was too shy to do anything for the 3 months we dated and her parents didn??t let her do anything. I just want to not be a burden, I want to make people happy. I want to be useful, but my stupid ass brain decides otherwise. It doesn??t give me the energy to do something, doesn??t give me the motivation, doesn??t give me the rationality that I need to stop fucking myself over. All I want is for someone to be there for me as much as I??ll be there for them. I need someone who won??t ghost me for being clingy because I was worried about them. I want someone who I feel actually loves me. Instead, I??m shy, antisocial, introverted, and overall idiotic. My mannerisms(?) are so awful I??m possibly autistic (coming from a psychiatrist). Why am I like this? Why do I have to have such hormones for affection when I??m well aware I won??t get any? Why am I so selfishly selfless?

"Sad uni studentI??m so lonely. I??ve wanted a girlfriend for many years now, but it still hasn??t happened yet. I don??t know what I??m doing wrong either. I don??t want to come across as narcissistic or vain or anything like that, but I genuinely think I??m an interesting and kind person, one who??d be a fantastic boyfriend. I??m definitely average looking, but everyone I know thinks I??m a great person, and I don??t think I live in an echo chamber about this either. I have a lot of friends, have great family and am fairly personable as a whole, not shy really at all. I went through high school just accepting that there aren??t enough people there to find a girl for me, as I went to a small school. No problem, I thought, university would be better! Obviously because of the pandemic I??ve really been screwed by this, and can only meet people in general in my faculty, one that is known for having a skewed gender ratio. And because of this, I feel bad for the girls in my program as they probably get pressured a lot to date by all these guys who are in similar situations to me. I try and am trying to make friends with lots of people, but I don??t see the connection with anyone there. Since I??m 18, obviously I??ve tried dating apps, but I hardly get any matches at all, if any on certain apps. And all of those do not pan out at all, I??ve maybe gotten 2 legitimate responses this whole year. Everyone keeps telling me, ??there??s a girl for you out there?? but it seems so hopeless. I know I could be a great boyfriend who would be there for her through everything, but it seems like no girls want to do the same with me.

I can??t stand the way I am towards people but I struggle to change my ways. I wanted to be able to hold up my friendships forever but I have sunk too much, done too many fucked up things now. I can??t maintain relationships being the person I am. Too selfish and full of my own time possibly. It hurts to try and reach out and so I avoid it. I know I need to message back but a large part of me rather just disappear than go there. I need to make lasting changes to myself before I could really ever think to maintain a solid relationship.

"A downward spiral(22/m btw) I think all of my problems started in high school when I started playing video games by myself. I would spend 10-11 hours a day playing video games, staying up until the early morning, not sleeping enough, and then I would go to school too tired to function. The classic depression mixture. This meant I couldn't really socialize very well (think literally falling asleep/ being sleepy all day) which meant i was poorly socialized going into college. The real problem was that I had no interests and nothing to bond with people over. I couldn't bond over gaming because I was so socially awkward that I thought people would make fun of me for liking video games. To this day I still don't use discord very much, even though there are rooms designed for things I like. I feel like an outsider looking in, like I'm barely a person anymore. Does anyone else feel this way?",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual describes spending excessive time alone playing video games, which led to poor socialization skills. this lack of social interaction during formative years, such as high school and college, contributed to feelings of being an outsider and difficulty bonding with others. the mention of not using discord despite having interests aligns with a sense of social awkwardness and fear of judgment, further reinforcing the individual's isolation. the narrative ends with a plea for connection, asking if anyone else feels the same way, highlighting a deep sense of loneliness and a desire for understanding and companionship."

The first number I learned to dial was hers and from that moment on we spend every single day talking. Before school and usually after??I??d call her or she??d call me and would joke and laugh about everything. 

In 2011 she had a stroke and went into a coma. She spent 2 weeks in before they made a decision to take her off. The whole time I spent every day sitting beside her during visitation. The one time I missed visitation, was the day she died. 

Since then I??ve felt so empty and alone.  Most days are very hard and feel like she just died or that i haven??t heard from her because she went away somewhere. I still haven??t removed her number from my phone. I??m not suicidal, but I??d rather not be here. Happiness has always been a chore to find and when I do think I??ve found it, it??s not. My parents and I don??t have a good relationship because I??m gay. They put me out at 17 and I was forced to sleep in the hallway because they didn??t want the gay spirit on the furniture. 

Loneliness is such a sad affair.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loss and isolation following the death of the author's grandmother, who was a significant source of emotional support and companionship. the detailed recounting of daily interactions with the grandmother highlights the depth of their bond, which underscores the void left by her passing. the author's expression of feeling empty and alone since her death, coupled with the ongoing struggle to find happiness, are clear indicators of loneliness. the strained relationship with the parents, exacerbated by their rejection due to the author's sexual orientation, further compounds the sense of isolation. the lack of a supportive familial network and the enduring grief over the grandmother's death are typical indicators of loneliness. the mention of not removing the grandmother's number from the phone symbolizes an inability to move on, reinforcing the persistent state of loneliness."
"Minutes go by and suddenly the days overI just moved again. This is feeing like a journal entry lol but fuck it it helps. I??ve moved 12 times in my short 18 years on this planet. Honestly it feels like no problem but with everything else I??m so frustrated. Angry. Every time I heal i feel like things will finally look up again and then I??m back in a pit. I have no one to call mine. I just want someone who can support my wildest dreams. Not even my closest friends can support my goals and I??m sometimes the only thing they have. Maybe one day things will get better for me but for now I??m just tired of fighting. All my problems are just pure fucking circumstance. And I can??t figure myself out. I can??t be happy cuz I was born in a place I didn??t choose. I can??t catch a fucking break. And I??m honestly just tired. Physically and mentally. And I??m scared. I??m fucking terrified i don??t know how I??m gonna be the man I wanted when I can??t even look my demons in the face anymore.

:) hope everyone is having a better night than me but to be honest this is more me venting than caring for any of you",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of frustration and emotional exhaustion. the individual expresses feelings of isolation, noting that despite their efforts to heal and improve, they repeatedly find themselves in a negative emotional state. the frequent relocations have likely contributed to a lack of stable, supportive relationships, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the person mentions having no one to call their own and a lack of support for their dreams, even from their closest friends, which further highlights their sense of disconnection. the narrative also reflects a struggle with self-identity and an inability to find happiness, attributing this to circumstances beyond their control. the language used conveys a sense of being overwhelmed and fearful about the future, as well as a resignation to their current state of pain and loneliness. the closing sentiment, where the individual expresses a hope that others are having a better night, underscores their awareness of their own suffering and a desire for empathy, even if it is masked by a need to vent."
"Think i got dumped and my gf is most likely cheating on me right now, going home with a guy.Anyone want to chat with me? I have no social life or friends and she is all i got so really feeling broken and helpless",1,"the narrative exhibits several clear indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses a profound sense of isolation, noting the absence of a social life and friends, which are critical components of a support network. the statement ""she is all i got"" underscores a heavy reliance on a single relationship for emotional support, which, when threatened, can amplify feelings of loneliness. the use of words like ""broken"" and ""helpless"" conveys a deep emotional distress and a lack of coping mechanisms. additionally, the plea for someone to chat with them indicates a desperate need for social interaction and connection, further highlighting their current state of loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate the psychological state of someone grappling with loneliness and the associated emotional turmoil."
"I'm really downI have some friends, but I feel them gradually growing away from me. They don't ever initiate conversation. They might hang out or play games if I put in a lot of effort for it. I just feel real lonely lately",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness, as evidenced by the individual's feelings of friends growing distant and the lack of initiative from others to maintain the relationship. the effort required to engage with friends and the absence of reciprocal communication are common indicators of social disconnection. the phrase ""i just feel real lonely lately"" explicitly conveys the emotional state of the individual, highlighting a profound sense of isolation. these elements are consistent with the psychological understanding that loneliness often stems from unreciprocated social interactions and a perceived lack of meaningful connections."
No friendsFor the first time in my 32 years of life I have absolutely no friends. This is a type of loneliness and sadness that I don??t know how to cope with.

This feels so incredible horrible.,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress, characteristic of loneliness. the individual explicitly states having no friends for the first time in their life, which signifies a drastic change in their social environment and support system. the mention of not knowing how to cope with this new type of sadness highlights the overwhelming nature of their emotions. the questions about mourning lost relationships and making new friends indicate a struggle with both past losses and future uncertainties, further emphasizing their feelings of disconnection and despair. the phrase ""this feels so incredible horrible"" underscores the intensity of their emotional pain, a common experience among those suffering from loneliness. these elements collectively point to a deep sense of loneliness and the psychological turmoil associated with it."
"(29m) Seeking CompanionshipSeeking validation and purpose on this floating rock. I??m pretty plain and boring. Sometimes funny, most times overthinking. Really looking for a genuine friend to text throughout the day, to bounce theories off of and to motivate and cheer on! I??m usually at work which is very boring and mostly solitary.  Looking for depth not just hi and bye.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness through various elements. the author explicitly expresses a desire for companionship and validation, which are common indicators of loneliness. the statement ""seeking companionship"" and the yearning for a ""genuine friend to text throughout the day"" highlight the individual's need for meaningful social connections. the mention of feeling ""plain and boring"" and the tendency to ""overthink"" suggest low self-esteem and a preoccupation with their own perceived inadequacies, often linked to loneliness. the solitary nature of their work environment, described as ""very boring and mostly solitary,"" further exacerbates their feelings of isolation. their preference for ""depth not just hi and bye"" interactions underscores a craving for substantial and fulfilling relationships, which they currently lack. all these aspects together paint a clear picture of someone experiencing loneliness and seeking deeper human connections to fill the void in their social life."
"Been hit with an overwhelming feeling of loneliness over the last few daysIt came out of nowhere, I feel a bit better when I??m with people but the feeling is still there and as soon as I??m alone I break down.

"I absolutely hate the art of ghostingThis never fails. I meet someone on here or another social media platform, they size me up and feel me out...then when they come to the conclusion that I don't fit their personal criteria - or I don't meet their wants and needs...I get ghosted.

I totally understand that I'm not always gonna fill in a person's empty gaps in life but why oh why does this always have to end with me being ghosted?? I'd much rather know the truth instead of always wondering what the hell happened.

I would never ghost anybody because my mindset allows me to have the common courtesy and decency to end the encounter on a friendly note by wishing them well and saying goodbye. What I always get every single fucking time is some bullshit excuse to mask their real intention like....""I'm busy right now, ttyl"" or ""I gotta do this or that, we'll talk tomorrow"".

It's like a sledgehammer to the heart and I doubt they realize the hurt they place onto people like me. I speak for everyone who feels like shit from being ghosted. Sometimes all I want is a friend but this must be equivalent to winning the lottery. Or heck, maybe I'm the one that's weird because I get attached to people whenever they say hi. That's how lonely I am.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects deep feelings of loneliness and frustration. the author describes a repeated pattern of being ghosted, which leads to emotional pain and a sense of rejection. the mention of not fitting into others' personal criteria highlights a feeling of inadequacy and unworthiness. the desire for honesty and a proper goodbye indicates a need for closure and human connection, which is often lacking. the author’s statement about wanting a friend and feeling like winning the lottery if they find one underscores the rarity and value they place on companionship. the final admission of getting attached easily and feeling extremely lonely reveals a vulnerable state of mind and a strong longing for social interaction and acceptance. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they show a significant emotional impact from social interactions and a profound need for meaningful connections."
"Lonely on NYE.I don??t have any friends to hang out with on NYE or just in general. My parents keep saying that I should go out and enjoy my youth while I can, even though they know that there isn??t anyone in my life who would want to hang with me. 

I just want to clarify, I??m not a horrible person, I think people don??t want to hang with me because I??m no fun. 

2019 has been the loneliest year and I??m afraid 2020 is gonna be worse.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly mentions having no friends to spend time with, particularly highlighting the isolation felt during new year's eve, a time typically associated with social gatherings and celebrations. the reference to their parents' advice to go out and enjoy their youth, despite knowing the author's lack of social connections, underscores a sense of disconnection and misunderstanding from those close to them. the author's self-reflection on why people might not want to hang out with them, attributing it to being ""no fun,"" suggests a negative self-perception and a potential internalization of their loneliness. the overall tone of the narrative, combined with the author's fear that the upcoming year might be even lonelier, further emphasizes their deep sense of isolation and concern for their social future. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."

Looking outside and hoping there is someone for me somewhere out there, hoping to find me.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness, particularly evident during nighttime. the author describes night time as the worst, indicating a pattern where feelings of isolation intensify. the act of letting out emotions through song suggests an attempt to cope with overwhelming feelings, a common strategy among those experiencing loneliness. however, the narrative reveals that this coping mechanism is often insufficient, leading the author to spiral into their thoughts, exacerbating their loneliness. the repeated use of the word ""lonely"" and the mention of falling asleep alone further underscore the pervasive sense of isolation. the hope that someone is out there for them highlights a longing for connection and companionship, which is a central aspect of loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate the author's struggle with feeling disconnected and their desire for meaningful human interaction."

TipsI'm looking for any tips for night's like these when I'm feeling extremely lonely and longing for someone I can't have.,1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of loneliness through the individual's admission of feeling extremely lonely and longing for someone unattainable. this longing for connection, especially for someone they cannot have, is a strong indicator of loneliness. the use of phrases like ""feeling extremely lonely"" highlights the intensity of their emotions, suggesting a deep-seated sense of isolation. seeking tips for coping with these feelings further implies a struggle with persistent loneliness, as the individual is actively looking for ways to manage their emotional pain. this narrative aligns with typical indicators of loneliness, such as the desire for social connection and the experience of emotional distress due to perceived social isolation."

"How to deal with lonelinessHello! Ever since I started my awakening path, I have been feeling very lonely and I don??t know how to deal with it.

I tried reaching out to several of them but no one actually wanted to reach out back to me and ask me how I am. There were so many days where I just wanted to hear from someone telling me that they??re there for me. Don??t we all love to hear that at some point through this journey of life? To know that there is someone who is always there for you no matter what is an amazing feeling. I wish I had a best friend. I wish I had someone to check up on me and ask me how everything was. I wish I had a best friend to call when I??m scared or worried. My husband works long hours and so he??s not always there whenever I need someone.

"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this.

Lately with a non existent social life, problems at work and not many to hang out with, I find myself slipping into a lonely, sad feeling. My career is good, I am respected and valued but I feel like I've lost my sense of purpose at work and I've become lost. I struggle to find motivation at work, I lack challenges, I've accomplished what I've wanted. 


Whenever I felt lonely or sad, work was my outlet and my distraction. This wasn't healthy and now I feel it. I lost touch with a lot of friends during the last year. I'm trying to meet new people and forge some connections but those don't happen over night. I find my days off to be so lonely, even after I get home from work I find myself sad and lonely. I hope I can break this cycle.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of loneliness through various indicators. the individual mentions a lack of social life and friends, highlighting a significant absence of meaningful connections. the struggle to find motivation and a sense of purpose at work, despite career success, suggests an emotional void that work can no longer fill. the repeated use of words like ""lonely"" and ""sad"" underscores the depth of their feelings. efforts to meet new people and forge connections indicate a recognition of the problem and a desire to overcome it, but also acknowledge the difficulty and time required to build new relationships. the sense of loneliness is pervasive, affecting both their personal and professional life, which is a typical indicator of loneliness."
"It never endsThe loneliness, why does it never end? Every person i hookup with leaves. Every person i try for a relationship for leaves. Every person i meet and expect only a good time or maybe friendship with leaves. I havent slept well in weeks because i feel the loneliness so strongly in my chest i cant find peace. Sleep is the only escape from the pain and i can barely even do that. I feel like im stuck in a never ending cycle of dissapointment. I cant hookup with someone without them saying ""i had a great time lets do this again!"" only to never hear from them again or slowly be ghosted. Dates never go past the first one. Not to mention every chance i get is months apart from each other. I feel lucky to even get these chances but it feels like it does me more harm than good. What good is sex if the other person didnt enjoy it? And what good is a date if the other person was just tolerating it? I have so much love to give and nobody to give it to. I crave human touch. I crave to have someone cuddled next to me when i go to sleep at night. Im so tired of this. I cant keep doing this for years. A family member of mine didnt get married until 50 with many failed relationships and women that cheated, lied, stole. What if thats me? I cant be lonely for that long i will never make it. My life feels pointless without someone by my side.",1,"the narrative vividly expresses a deep sense of loneliness and emotional pain. the author describes a recurring pattern of transient relationships and hookups that end abruptly, leading to feelings of abandonment and unfulfillment. the mention of sleeplessness due to the overwhelming sense of loneliness in their chest indicates significant emotional distress. the cyclical nature of their experiences, marked by brief moments of hope followed by disappointment, exacerbates their sense of isolation. the craving for human touch and the desire for a stable, loving relationship underscore their intense need for connection. the comparison to a family member's prolonged loneliness and failed relationships amplifies their fear of a similar fate, heightening their despair. these elements collectively illustrate classic indicators of loneliness, such as the yearning for meaningful connections, the pain of repeated rejection, and the profound impact on their mental well-being."
"I miss the opportunity of making friends in collegeSince graduating college last may, I moved to a new city and started a new job working nights. Overall, it??s been quite difficult to meet people outside of work between my schedule and the pandemic. 

I haven??t held an in person conversation with someone outside of work or my family in so long now that I feel I??ve forgotten how to make even make friends. The thought of putting myself out there is enough to exhaust me, yet I feel more alone than ever.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a struggle with connecting to others, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author mentions missing the opportunity to make friends in college and highlights the difficulty of meeting people due to their night work schedule and the ongoing pandemic. this combination of factors limits social interactions, exacerbating feelings of loneliness. the lack of in-person conversations outside of work or family further underscores the isolation. the author also expresses a sense of exhaustion at the thought of socializing, which is a common psychological response to prolonged loneliness. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."
"There's no reason to live, if you live in isolation.There really isn't. It hurts more than depression and suicidal thoughts combined. I can do whatever the fuck I want, but if I live in isolation, it doesn't matter. IMHO the meaning of life is human connection. Anything else doesn't matter. Think about it.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a belief that human connection is the fundamental meaning of life. the author explicitly states that living in isolation negates the value of life, which underscores a profound feeling of loneliness. phrases like ""there is no reason to live"" and ""it hurts more than depression and suicidal thoughts combined"" indicate intense emotional pain and despair, which are common symptoms of loneliness. the emphasis on the importance of human connection and the dismissal of other aspects of life as meaningless without it further highlight the author's yearning for social bonds. this strong focus on the absence of meaningful relationships and the associated emotional suffering are clear indicators of loneliness."
"Since I??ve gotten and stayed sober for 6 years all my friendships evaporated.I had one tell me ??we??ll never be equals?? (his insecurity meaning I??m too good for him, which is silly I don??t think like that).

Another decided to end our friendship over a difference in opinion over politics- that??s ok I suppose.  Happens a lot these days I guess.

The rest of the group I used to do stuff with (most of whom I introduced to one another) left me behind to go have fun together with each other without me.  And now I get to watch it here and there when retweeted or regramed pics of them all hanging out at the beach together pop up in my feed.  Just guts me.

At one party I attended sober where they were bumping cocaine and ketamine, one of them I truly believed I was closest to greeted me with ??what are you doing here??? and then a few minutes later, with a cocaine bumper to his nose asks me in this really flippant way, ??is this ok?!?? (meaning will it bother me, which of course it would not and did not until he said it so mean).

I finally moved away to a different town where I can??t seem to meet anyone who isn??t threatened by me for some reason.  I??m a bodybuilder and a lot of guys find that off putting I guess.  I do my best to be really humble and kind.

I understand drugs and alcohol bring people together socially however I??d invested years even decades in some of these friends.

So now I??m a recluse and can??t seem to leave my house anymore except for my AA meetings, which are full of really nice 75 year old men who I would hang out with I suppose- if they didn??t go to bed at 7 pm.",1,"the narrative describes a series of social rejections and feelings of isolation that are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual recounts how achieving sobriety led to the dissolution of long-standing friendships, with friends making hurtful comments and excluding them from social activities. the sense of exclusion is exacerbated by seeing friends enjoy activities without them through social media, which intensifies the feeling of being left out. attempts to form new connections in a different town have been unsuccessful, with the individual feeling misunderstood and unaccepted due to their bodybuilding. their social life is limited to aa meetings, where the age gap with other attendees further hinders meaningful connections. the combination of past rejections, failed attempts at new relationships, and limited social interactions contribute to a profound sense of loneliness."
"Becoming a dad has made me feel more lonelyI (27) became a father to a beautiful boy, who just turned 1, last year and I've come to feel more lonely since then because of how dads are treated, at least in my experience.
Whenever I, mom and baby are out together and a stranger, whether it be an old lady passing by or a shopkeeper etc, talks about the baby/parenting it's never directed towards me. I'm always standing there waiting for *their* conversation to be over. Our son is part of a few baby groups which I admittedly don't attend too often because of work but I still have come to know a few of the other moms but I never get more than polite small talk in and out of baby group. They're always more interested in getting my partner's opinion even when we have equal knowledge/experience. Doesn't help that I rarely see  any of the other dad's so I'm almost always the only male.

Anyway it all just makes me feel so excluded and it really sucks",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of exclusion and emotional isolation, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses feelings of being overlooked and undervalued in social interactions related to parenting, highlighting specific instances where conversations about the baby are directed solely at the mother, leaving him feeling invisible. this lack of acknowledgment and engagement from others, despite his equal involvement and knowledge, contributes to his sense of loneliness. the mention of rarely seeing other dads and being the only male in baby groups further intensifies his feelings of alienation. these experiences collectively underscore the emotional struggle of feeling disconnected and unsupported in his role as a father, which are classic signs of loneliness."

"My relationships are falling apartOne friend ghosted. Another one's starting to distance themselves from me. So now I'm hyper-focused on these issues while ignoring the ones that are fine, to the point where I start to neglect the people who are actually there for me.

By the time I'm done freaking out, the few friends I've had have started to slowly detach themselves too. So now instead of regaining the friendships I've lost, I just started losing more and more.

It hurts. I just want to feel okay and safe with someone for once.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of distress and isolation. the individual describes a pattern of deteriorating relationships, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the mention of being ghosted and friends distancing themselves highlights a lack of social support. the hyper-focus on negative aspects and neglect of supportive relationships suggests an overwhelming preoccupation with loss and abandonment. this cycle of losing more friends due to the stress of previous losses further exacerbates their loneliness. the expression of hurt and the desire to feel okay and safe with someone underscores a fundamental need for connection and security that is currently unmet. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."
"What if I??m never happyWhen I was in elementary school, I couldn??t wait to start middle school and make new friends. By the end of middle school, I wanted to start high school so badly. At the end of high school, I was so excited for university and a fresh start at everything. 

There??s no fresh start. I didn??t make any friends, or find people with my interests. I do things by myself, which is nice, but I just want to be able to get coffee or go out with people I can call my friends for once. I??m worried that if this wasn??t my fresh start I??ll never have one, and I??ll always be alone. 

I??m just so fucking lonely and miserable and I don??t know how to change.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and unmet expectations for social connections. the writer expresses a pattern of anticipation for new beginnings at various educational stages, hoping each would bring new friendships. however, the recurring disappointment in not forming these connections highlights a persistent feeling of loneliness. the mention of doing things alone, while acknowledging it as somewhat nice, underscores a desire for companionship and shared experiences. the explicit statements of feeling ""so fucking lonely and miserable"" and the fear of perpetual loneliness are strong indicators of emotional distress and a lack of social fulfillment. these elements collectively illustrate a significant experience of loneliness."

"Why does every conversation I star always end up with akward silence.Every time I try to initiate a conversation, it always ends dull. I even try to apologise if I am somehow boring and try to end the conversation if it's boring to the other person, but when they say ""no, it's fine"" they don't continue the conversation, instead I try to continue the conversation, but it's met with the responses like: ""cool, ok, fine, neat etc."",and even when I try to change the subject of the conversation it's still the same result.

So my conclusion about this is: WTF BROTHER?
Am I cursed or sm shit?
Do I have the Plague or some other very deadly and unknown disease?

I genuinely want to have a good long interesting conversation, because my day to day bs is silence solitude and general loneliness all day every day.

Pls tell me I need/want answers about this. If need be I will elaborate further on my type of ""personality"" so pls just tell me what am I supposed to do.

"I Feel extremely lonely, it's getting very hard mentally...I felt lonely for a while, but could live with that. Now it's getting worse. I don't have friends. meaning: I don't have anyone to say ""Hey! I feel like crap, let's just talk, or hang out"". Why it's getting worse? Cause it seems that life beats me harder and harder. In May-grandma got sick, couldn't walk for some time, had to look after her. In July my mom has had a surgery, not that fun of an experience. That's the only family I have btw. Has been sick since February myself. IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) - annoying shit. As I get stressed or upset I feel worse and worse. I try very hard to stay strong and not completely break down mentally. I'd guess the support from a friend or a girlfriend, would have made it easier. Unfortunately I don't have any of those.

im trying to like someone new",1,"the narrative expresses a deep yearning for attention, affection, and emotional connection, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly states feeling lonely and cold, which signifies emotional and possibly physical discomfort due to the lack of companionship. the repeated desire for someone to love them and the acknowledgment that they can't find the right person highlights a sense of desperation and unfulfilled need for intimate human interaction. the feelings of being unwanted and unworthy of love further emphasize their isolation and low self-esteem, common psychological effects of prolonged loneliness. the plea for someone to message them and not ghost them reveals a fear of abandonment and a strong desire for consistent, reliable communication. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."
"Does anyone have emotional heartache when alone? If so, what do you when you feel this?I??m coming to terms that the people that I have surrounded myself with, do not have the best intentions for me. Yet, I keep going back because I haven??t wanted to be alone. 
I??ve just been promoted to assistant manager at my place of employment and the person that I thought and felt was my friend and coworker vented to me about how she didn??t understand how I became assistant manager and how if she knew that they were still looking for an assistant manager she would have stepped up. It felt like she gaslite me (I hope I??m using the correct term) because afterwards I started to question if I was qualified to be in this position or not. I felt like she belittled me. 
I??m distancing myself from her as well as my other coworkers. I just feel this pain in my chest because deep within my soul i felt the pain of loneliness and didn??t want to just feel it and accept it, instead I went out and found shitty people to break me even more. 
I would much rather be lonely and proud of myself than to have a ton of friends and feel worthless.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of emotional distress and isolation. the individual describes experiencing heartache when alone and acknowledges surrounding themselves with people who do not have their best interests at heart. the feelings of betrayal and gaslighting by a supposed friend and coworker highlight a lack of supportive social connections. the pain in the chest and the deep feeling of loneliness are clear indicators of their emotional state. the decision to distance themselves from others, despite the promotion, further emphasizes their sense of isolation. the narrative concludes with a preference for being lonely and proud over having insincere friends, underscoring the individual's struggle with loneliness and the desire for genuine connections."
"I cry myself to sleep every nightI am 15 yeears old and I just don't want to actually connect with people, I tried but I just don't want to, I only have ""friends""
because of school. I don't even love my parents and no I am not deppresed and no I never considered suicide because I hate death. I had several girls that I would just make out with, they end up liking me but me not liking them back, I deal with this with a lot of dark humor and sarkazam, exersize and drinking since when I drink I feel realy reliefed and happy. I have no goals whatsoever. Since I can' connect with people I probably will not have friends in the future and will die alone
I just want to care about people and be loved

Any advice?",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a lack of genuine connection with others, stating that they only have ""friends"" due to school circumstances and do not want to connect with people despite trying. the use of quotation marks around ""friends"" suggests these relationships lack depth and emotional significance. the individual also mentions an inability to love their parents and a lack of emotional response towards romantic interests, indicating a broader difficulty in forming meaningful attachments. coping mechanisms such as dark humor, sarcasm, exercise, and drinking are mentioned, which can be seen as attempts to manage underlying feelings of isolation and emotional pain. the admission of feeling relief and happiness only when drinking points to a temporary escape from their persistent sense of disconnection. the narrative concludes with a bleak outlook on future relationships and a fear of dying alone, further underscoring the pervasive sense of loneliness. these elements collectively highlight the individual's struggle with forming and maintaining meaningful connections, a core aspect of loneliness."
"Lonely and lostIt shouldn??t come as a surprise that I say I am lonely as I am posting this on this subteddit but yeah that??s pretty much it.

In all honesty, how do I reach out? 
How do I find ??my people???
How do I stop feeling alike even when I??m with people?

Any advice is more than welcome!",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and a struggle to connect with others, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly states feeling lonely and questions how to reach out and find their community, highlighting a desire for connection but an uncertainty on how to achieve it. the mention of feeling alone even when surrounded by people is a classic sign of emotional loneliness, where physical presence of others does not translate to emotional fulfillment. this sense of disconnection and seeking advice on how to overcome it underscores the depth of their loneliness."
I??m scared that I??ve become too comfortable in my loneliness.I??m a 17 year old with a few friends and I have almost adapted to being happy in my loneliness. When I??m alone I genuinely feel okay and that I??m fine with it. But sometimes there are instances where I get so low I start asking myself ??How can you just be so okay with this ???. I wish I had someone who could just hold me and tell me that it??s alright and there??s nothing wrong with me.,1,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional state where the individual oscillates between a sense of comfort in solitude and a deeper yearning for connection. the person mentions having a few friends but still experiences significant loneliness, indicating that their social interactions may not fulfill their emotional needs. the admission of feeling ""okay"" when alone contrasts sharply with moments of deep sadness and self-questioning, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the longing for physical and emotional reassurance, such as wanting someone to hold them and affirm their worth, further highlights an unmet need for intimate connection and validation. these elements collectively point to a struggle with loneliness, despite attempts to adapt or find contentment in solitude."
Tired[removed],0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing tiredness, which can be a common feeling resulting from various factors such as physical exertion, lack of sleep, or stress. however, there are no indications of emotional or social isolation that typically characterize loneliness. the absence of references to a lack of social connections, feelings of emptiness, or a desire for companionship implies that the individual's tiredness is not linked to loneliness. instead, it seems more likely related to a temporary state of fatigue. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of sadness about being alone or a longing for social interaction."
"Slowly growing apartI am (17)M and I have been dating this girl for about 9 months now. She is really cool, and interesting. Over the past month however I have seen her less and less. Not seeing her has made me realize how much of my life is dedicated to her. Without her I am just a bored, sad, and boring person.",0,"the narrative describes a young individual reflecting on their relationship and recent changes in their interaction frequency. despite feeling bored and sad without their partner, the focus remains on the realization of how much time and energy they invest in the relationship. the individual's self-awareness and recognition of their emotions are clear, but there is no explicit indication of pervasive loneliness. rather, the narrative suggests a temporary emotional state tied to the absence of their partner, which is a common experience in relationships rather than a deeper sense of chronic loneliness. the mention of feeling boring without the partner highlights a dependency on the relationship for excitement, yet this is framed more as a situational reaction than a fundamental loneliness."
"Venting Off.M29 here,

Please ignore my spelling or grammar mistake, my English is bad. open for corrections.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress and feelings of isolation. despite never having had a romantic relationship and feeling left out as peers and family members move forward in their personal lives, the individual remains socially engaged. they interact with friends and family, even giving relationship advice, which suggests a level of social integration and support. the individual's awareness of their own mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and their coping mechanisms, like listening to sad music, indicate a level of self-awareness and resilience. while the narrative expresses deep sadness and a sense of not being understood or cared for, the presence of ongoing social interactions and self-reflective coping strategies are important factors that mitigate the intensity of loneliness."
"Missing uI miss u so much, I'm sorry I wasn't the person u needed me to be, but I hope that you're loved to the fullest. I will love u forever ??????",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of remorse and longing, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the writer expresses a heartfelt apology and a wish for the recipient's happiness and love, which suggests a focus on the other person's well-being rather than their own feelings of isolation. the phrase ""i will love u forever"" indicates enduring affection, which can exist independently of loneliness. while there is a tone of regret for not meeting the recipient's needs, it does not explicitly convey the internal state of loneliness. instead, the narrative seems to be more about reconciliation and ongoing emotional connection, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Looking forward to the day I can cry aloneMy family would be away from house for 15 hours next week and I have planned to listen to songs on speakers and cry alone. I have been holding it in for a while. I don't wanna cry in front of them. Depression is a taboo and getting taunts is the last thing I want while I'm crying. 
I don't blame my parents for not understanding depression. They were born in the era where no such thing existed.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is anticipating a moment of solitude to express their emotions through crying. the person plans to take advantage of their family's absence to listen to music and cry alone, indicating a need for privacy rather than a desire for social connection. they mention holding in their emotions to avoid judgment and taunts related to depression, which suggests a concern about societal stigma rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. the individual's acknowledgment of their parents' lack of understanding about depression reflects a level of empathy and acceptance of their family's limitations, rather than a feeling of isolation. these elements suggest that the person is more focused on managing their emotional expression and navigating social stigma rather than experiencing profound loneliness."
"I know it??s not a race, but can you hurry upI want to meet someone I connect with, it??s been years and I know all the cliche lines but I??m tired of mantras today . I??m tired of sitting here Wondering if I??ll every fall in love again. I??m tired of watching my peers get married while I haven??t had a serious relationship in years. It??s not a competition, I get it .. I would still want to meet someone even if my peers were single so again hurry up.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of impatience and frustration with the current state of the individual's romantic life. the person expresses a desire to meet someone they connect with and acknowledges feeling tired of waiting and seeing others around them get married. however, the narrative does not convey a deeper sense of isolation or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. the focus is more on the specific aspect of romantic relationships rather than a broader sense of disconnection from others. the mention of knowing ""all the cliche lines"" and being ""tired of mantras"" suggests a level of self-awareness and perhaps resilience, indicating that the person is actively seeking change rather than feeling defeated. the narrative lacks the pervasive sense of hopelessness or profound solitude that often characterizes loneliness. instead, it highlights a situational frustration that, while significant, does not necessarily equate to the broader, more encompassing experience of loneliness."
"Anyone else losing faith in humanitySeriously just wondering what the point of this shit is, anyone else?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disillusionment and frustration with humanity, which can be a common sentiment but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author is reaching out to others by asking if anyone else shares their feelings, suggesting a desire for connection and validation from the community. this attempt to engage with others and seek common ground implies that the individual is not isolated or feeling a lack of social interaction. instead, they are expressing a broader existential concern and looking for solidarity, which are not direct indicators of loneliness. the context and tone suggest a collective questioning rather than a personal sense of isolation."
NooseI can't fucking do this anymore,0,"the narrative expresses a high level of distress and frustration, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of strong language and the phrase ""i cannot fucking do this anymore"" suggest a feeling of being overwhelmed or at the end of one's rope. however, this could be due to a variety of factors such as stress, burnout, or a specific challenging situation rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness. loneliness typically involves feelings of being disconnected from others, a lack of meaningful relationships, or a sense of not belonging. the narrative does not provide any context about social connections or relationships, which are key indicators of loneliness. therefore, the absence of references to social isolation or a lack of support suggests that the primary issue may lie elsewhere."
"?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?????? hey fighter, things will be better soon. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??nan",0,"the narrative contains a message of encouragement and optimism, which is generally not indicative of loneliness. phrases like ""hey fighter"" and ""things will be better soon"" suggest a supportive and positive outlook. these expressions imply that the author is reaching out to offer comfort and hope, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or despair. the use of encouraging language typically reflects a sense of connection and empathy towards others, which are not common characteristics of someone experiencing loneliness. the overall tone of the narrative is uplifting and motivational, further suggesting that the author is in a positive state of mind rather than a lonely one."
"Seeking a fellow lonely soul to have an audio conversation with (clean convo; people around my age or older)Hi there, fellow human! I'm a shy and a bit anxious 29 yo person with a European accent. If you feel like you need someone to talk to, I'm all ears. I'm open to conversing about most things (I enjoy art, philosophy, music, literature), apart from really urgent things, because I'm not an expert in mental health :/ But if you're feeling down and comfortable with a mutually respectful voice conversation, feel free to PM :)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is reaching out for social interaction, yet there are several indicators suggesting they are not experiencing loneliness. the person describes themselves as shy and a bit anxious, which can be typical traits of introversion rather than loneliness. their willingness to engage in conversations about various interests such as art, philosophy, music, and literature indicates a proactive approach to socializing and finding common ground with others. they also express a clear boundary regarding their limitations in mental health expertise, which shows self-awareness and a healthy approach to social interactions. the invitation for a mutually respectful conversation and the comfort in discussing personal interests suggest a desire for connection without the desperation or isolation often associated with loneliness."
I'm done with life.It's something I always thought about. I think I made up my mind. I can't go on anymore. Everything is going wrong. Everyone I ever cared about had left me. I hope tomorrow I would finally have the courage to do it.,0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, with the individual indicating thoughts of ending their life and feeling that everything is going wrong. while these emotions are intense and concerning, they do not necessarily equate to loneliness. the focus is on the individual's perception of life's challenges and their internal struggle rather than a specific sense of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. the mention of everyone they cared about having left them could imply a feeling of abandonment, but the overall context suggests a broader existential crisis rather than loneliness per se. psychological insights indicate that hopelessness and suicidal ideation often stem from a complex interplay of factors, including mental health issues, rather than solely from loneliness."
"Before I goI have a mild disability. It's not severe enough to warrant sick pay, so I work real jobs in the real world, which in general is a privilege, but it's also not just handed out.

I once got a job based on my qualifications. When the boss's boss saw me, he suddenly changed the job profile to target my particular disabilities, forced me to sign a paper with the job description and told me that I was there to defraud the company for workman's comp. I was fired on the spot after one day. Maybe that happened to him before, but I was confounded that wanting to be able to eat entailed that much imagination and contrivance. When I brought this up on another subreddit, the resounding consensus was that I deserved to be fired and that I probably was a criminal. I still don't see it. I had never taken a handout from anyone, and it was insult to injury, as I was 29 and it was the first time I'd been accused of being a criminal just for being disabled. Before then it was just people avoiding me because they were afraid of getting cooties.  

Other jobs I've been expected to prove myself by working up to half of my hours off the clock. It's sort of a way of saying ""yes I'm a freak. I come in peace. I mean you no harm and I will not eat your children."" Advice people give about ""Not letting myself get taken advantage of"" falls flat when they themselves would never hire me, and the only time they've asked for art, architectural or other services from me is because they want it for free. As difficult as jobs are to get for most people, amplify by 5 or 10 for me, which means pounding the pavement that much harder, and when income is found, it comes with more abuse, far less pay, and I make do with what I've got while keeping up appearances of being less poor to avoid even more discrimination. 

I've never been able to commune with other disabled people because I'm outside of a certain cultural demographic. When I lurk communities, I see people talking incessantly about doctor's visits, personal assistants, rehab centers, prescritions, etc, etc. Their whole life revolves around the caring culture and profession that commodifies them, whereas I've learned make my own medicine from natural and grey market sources to stay alive.  I simply don't make enough money for healthcare in the US, and I was never grandfathered into the social security system (no matter, it's being stripped anyway, and disabled people by the thousands are ending up homeless or dead without meds while the public pretends it's all about mental illness and drugs). 

I felt lucky to find a marriage partner 28 years ago. An amputee. I'm no fool. I stayed within my league. I've never taken it for granted, but I spent the first 23 years working 2-3 jobs as my spouse was what you call ""disabled, but from a rich family"".  They could work, but shit jobs were beneath them. And because that was all that was available for people like us, I filled my entire life with shit jobs, no vacations, often 7 days a week for many years.

When I was literally unable to move one night my spouse came to help. When it meant food and shelter loss for them, they helped. So I've helped them gain income by riding on my work history as an assistant, now me being the assistant to them. I've been the one to foster and crutch them into working for a living.  

As they've come to terms with being poor, I've had to deal with their other issues over the years, the first being their stance that there's nothing wrong with pedophilia. We were, like the majority of people disabled since childhood, both sexually abused as children. They, after two years of dealing with the trauma personally, concluded it caused no harm.  The latter issue complements it. In their worldview, people who aren't white are inferior. I'm mixed, so I'm now getting calling the ""N"" word when they're angry (I'm mestizo, not mulatto). it's not in the cute, ironic way. I guess in a sense it's just the thing that happens with aging. I was raised conservative, but mellowed out as I got older. They were uber upper middle class (do what you want without consequences) liberal. In our married years, they've migrated from Scientology, to  Satanism, to Libertarianism, to full on Fascism, which is really not surprising for a life long gamer. In those years they've also completely lost their sense of humor and are a chore to be around. 

Being fascist is expedient, like any cult. You're better than those outside the circle without having to qualify. But what do you get out of it if you're a cripple?  You have no voice. It doesn't serve you. You will be killed, eventually. However, in the past year they've gone full tilt fash I've noticed I actually help others more, behind my spouse's back. It's kind of a way of washing this 28 year failure off my skin. People tend to shit on you when you help them, but if it's a stranger on the side road who needs gas money, or someone who need a bus pass, socks, a snack, I don't get the punishment for merely showing altruism.  It feels good to help a member of the species out without class expectations. I feel a lot like the ending of ""Serial Experiments: Lain"", coming to terms with the fact that you will never be human, and no one will ever know you, or want to, but the few you get to know short term over the years is good enough. 

I knew where society was heading when I was 25, but I honestly never thought I'd live to see 50. I notice a lot of people expressing their despondency at how things are. Is it because you don't like how outsiders are being treated? Or is it because you're afraid of becoming the next outsider?  

I fully understand that I'm dogshit.  Everyone thinks people like me have an easy life, so it's okay to shit on me a little to blow off their own steam. I know that writing stuff like this is foolish, and seeking understanding in the ether of humanity is like asking a rapist for mercy.  I write a lot because I know my story will likely be eventually crushed in a likely unpleasant demise.",0,"the narrative describes a life filled with significant challenges and hardships, including dealing with a disability, employment discrimination, and a difficult marriage. despite these adversities, the individual demonstrates resilience and a pragmatic approach to survival. they find ways to support themselves and their spouse, even when faced with systemic inequities and personal betrayals. the tone of the narrative is one of realism and endurance rather than isolation or despair. the writer reflects on their experiences with a sense of acceptance and even a touch of defiance, indicating a strong sense of self and purpose. they engage in altruistic acts, helping strangers in small but meaningful ways, which suggests a connection to the broader human experience. this act of giving, despite personal suffering, points to an underlying sense of community and belonging, even if it's not immediately reciprocated. the individual’s reflections on societal issues and personal identity further illustrate a complex understanding of their place in the world, one that goes beyond mere survival to encompass a deeper existential contemplation. while the narrative does not shy away from the harsh realities of life, it also does not dwell in a state of loneliness or isolation; rather, it portrays a life lived with intention and a continuous effort to find meaning and connection amidst adversity."
"AttractiveGuess I have to accept that only attractive people find love, everyone else is scraps like me",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of self-deprecation and frustration regarding the perceived relationship between attractiveness and finding love. while the author feels like they are not attractive and therefore less likely to find love, this sentiment does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it reflects a negative self-image and a belief in societal standards of beauty. typical indicators of loneliness would include descriptions of feeling isolated, lacking meaningful connections, or experiencing emotional pain due to solitude. in this case, the focus is more on self-worth and comparison to others rather than a direct expression of loneliness. the absence of specific references to social isolation or a desire for companionship further supports this assessment."
ah yes New Year??s EveThe perfect night to stay home and get belligerently drunk by myself at home and cry about my ex who I still dream about 6 months later!!!!!!!,0,"the narrative describes an individual choosing to spend new year's eve alone, getting drunk, and crying about an ex-partner. while this might seem like a depiction of loneliness, several factors suggest otherwise. the tone is exaggerated and contains elements of humor and sarcasm, indicating a level of self-awareness and emotional processing that is often not present in genuine loneliness. the author’s decision to engage in self-reflective behavior, such as dreaming about an ex and openly expressing their emotions, suggests they are dealing with their feelings rather than being consumed by a sense of isolation. this narrative might reflect a temporary state of sadness or a coping mechanism, rather than a deeper, chronic experience of loneliness."
"Everyone just up and left meI don't know why I'm posting this I just want it off my chest so I might as well scream in to the void and see if it screams back. 

So a little bit about me im 19 and nb, I have ADHD and ASD and several other mental health issues and I'm not the best at understanding or communicating with people.

So whitin the span of a few weeks I just lost... everyone. It all started with me braking up with my boyfriend, then my best friend left me, and a lot of other friends and people that were close to me all left. There was no reason why they did, everyone just stopped talking to me for no reason at all. I don't know what I've done for that to happen, but it did. I've been all alone for like a month now I've tried making some new friends, but apparently I'm the worst and deserve a block cause I don't like a specific type of music or cause I just say ""sorry"" a lot. I don't know if it's all my fault cause people seemed to really like me before that... And suddenly no one does.

And now in the most overwhelming time of my life where I try to get in to uni and I'm just trying to get the best notes possible I have no one to talk to and get my mind off of stuff. I have gotten extremely depressed and I'm falling behind on everything :).

And like... I don't get it I try to be the best for people im always there if needed, I give advice, I try to make people happy... so stuff just doesn't make sense to me.

I'm sorry for just whining for a while and if you read trough this, thanks!",0,"the narrative portrays a deep sense of isolation and confusion as the individual describes the sudden departure of close relationships and their subsequent struggle to form new connections. despite their efforts to be supportive and present for others, they find themselves alone and misunderstood, exacerbating their existing mental health challenges. the mention of trying to get into university and falling behind due to overwhelming stress further highlights the significant emotional burden they are carrying. while the individual expresses their distress and sense of abandonment, the overall tone suggests a temporary phase of social disconnection rather than a chronic state of loneliness. their awareness of the situation and active attempts to make new friends indicate resilience and a proactive approach to overcoming their current struggles."
"i miss having someone to talkwould like to find some friends here ;

Down to talk about anything with anyone... just don't be dry texter

If u want long term friend dm me :)",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and making new friends, which is a common human experience and not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the writer expresses a clear and proactive approach to seeking companionship by inviting others to engage in conversation and specifying a preference for meaningful interactions over superficial ones. this demonstrates a healthy understanding of their social needs and an ability to articulate them. the tone is optimistic and open, suggesting that the writer is actively looking to enhance their social life rather than expressing distress or isolation. the request for a ""long term friend"" indicates a focus on building lasting connections, further emphasizing a positive and forward-thinking mindset. overall, the narrative shows an individual who is socially aware and motivated to form new relationships, rather than someone who is currently experiencing loneliness."
"Hi 30 something male with asperger. Not working at mo. Pastimes are gym,books,tv,netflix,internet,memes. Can talk about anything.",0,"the narrative describes a 30-something male with asperger who is currently not working. despite this, he mentions a variety of pastimes including going to the gym, reading books, watching tv and netflix, browsing the internet, and enjoying memes. these activities suggest that he has a range of interests and ways to occupy his time, which can be indicative of a well-rounded and engaged individual. the ability to talk about anything also suggests a level of openness and potential for social interaction, even if it might be challenging due to his condition. overall, the narrative does not convey a sense of isolation or emotional distress that would typically be associated with loneliness. instead, it reflects a person who is finding ways to stay engaged and entertained, despite any social or occupational challenges they might face."
"It??s honestly meanI don??t understand why one just has to be rude about not wanting to talk with someone. I??ve gotten ghosted on by just wanting to be there for someone .-. Either way I just want to let you know that if you need someone to talk to, I??m here",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is open to social interaction and expresses a willingness to support others. while they mention experiences of being ghosted and encountering rudeness, their response is not one of isolation but rather of continued outreach and availability. the tone suggests resilience and a proactive approach to maintaining connections, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead of withdrawing or expressing feelings of solitude, the person emphasizes their readiness to engage and offer companionship, highlighting an active social presence and a supportive attitude."
Will give adviceI will give you advice to address your loneliness. There are several good cures.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is offering advice and solutions to address loneliness, rather than expressing personal feelings of loneliness. the language used is proactive and supportive, focusing on providing help to others. this indicates a sense of empathy and understanding, which suggests the person is in a position to assist rather than seeking help themselves. the use of phrases like ""i will give you advice"" and ""there are several good cures"" implies confidence and a sense of purpose, characteristics typically associated with someone who is not currently experiencing loneliness. the narrative lacks personal anecdotes or expressions of isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it centers on offering guidance, showcasing an outward focus rather than an inward struggle with loneliness."
"Do you ever feel like you're just not good enough?I generally don't have all that many people to talk to, most of my friends and I have drifted away over the years. Although I do have this one friend who do deeply care about, she uses a different social media site. Sadly we don't talk all that much either, as she'll go inactive for weeks/months at a time. The two of us have been good friends with each other for the past several years, but I just feel like when I try to massage her I'm bothering her in some little way or form. 


I dunno, I just feel like I'm being a burden on her whenever I attempt to reach out with her.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-doubt and concern about being a burden to others, which can be common feelings for many people. the individual mentions having a friend they deeply care about, indicating that they do have meaningful connections, even if they are not always active. the mention of drifting away from friends over the years is also a typical part of life as people grow and change. while there is a hint of loneliness in the narrative, the presence of a significant friendship and the lack of pervasive feelings of isolation suggest that the individual is not experiencing profound loneliness. their concerns seem more centered around self-worth and maintaining relationships rather than an overwhelming sense of being alone."
"Who cares? (Social test)I've been doing a test for the last week checking if any of my friends (and family) care about hearing from me. I've gone completely offline, I don't check Instagram, discord is offline and steam is in ""appear offline"" mode, still haven't got a single ""hi"" but I'm starting to like it this way, very chill.",0,"the narrative describes an individual conducting a social experiment to see if their friends and family would reach out in their absence from online platforms. while the person notes the lack of messages, they also express a sense of enjoyment and relaxation from being offline, referring to the experience as ""very chill."" this indicates a level of contentment and acceptance with the situation rather than distress or sadness. the use of phrases like ""starting to like it this way"" suggests an adaptive response and a potential preference for solitude, which contrasts with feelings of loneliness. the overall tone lacks the emotional pain or longing for connection that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, it shows a person who is exploring their social dynamics with a sense of curiosity and finding peace in the process."
Haiii:3Hai I??m Alice! I??m new here!,0,"the narrative suggests a friendly and open demeanor, typical of someone who is comfortable reaching out and initiating social interactions. the use of multiple exclamation points and playful emoticons indicates a positive and enthusiastic attitude. these elements are generally associated with individuals who feel connected and are actively engaging with others, rather than experiencing loneliness. the introduction is brief but confident, showing no signs of hesitation or anxiety that might be present in someone feeling isolated. overall, the tone and content reflect social ease and a readiness to form new connections."

Thanks.",0,"the narrative presents an individual who is reflecting on their social interactions and the challenges they face in maintaining friendships. despite expressing concerns about being perceived as disagreeable or narcissistic, the individual demonstrates self-awareness and a desire for meaningful connections. they acknowledge their ability to engage others in conversation and humor, suggesting a level of social competence. the contemplation of seeking therapy indicates a proactive approach to personal growth and addressing potential issues. while they express some dissatisfaction with their social experiences, their overall tone and actions reflect a sense of agency and an openness to solutions, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these aspects suggest someone who is actively seeking to improve their social life and is not resigned to a state of loneliness."
"Haven't made any friends for 3 yearsAnd all my previous friends wont answer messages, we started to drift and now they won't talk to me. And I have no idea how to make more friends.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual has not made any new friends for three years and mentions that previous friends have stopped responding to messages, leading to a sense of drifting apart. despite this, the narrative does not convey a deep emotional distress or pervasive sense of isolation that typically accompanies loneliness. the individual seems more focused on the practical aspect of not knowing how to make new friends rather than expressing feelings of sadness, emptiness, or despair. the lack of emotional depth and the emphasis on the logistical problem of forming new connections suggest that while the person may be experiencing social challenges, they are not necessarily suffering from loneliness."
Ever wanted to end it?[removed],0,"the narrative suggests an individual contemplating a significant emotional struggle, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. such expressions can stem from various mental health challenges, including depression or existential crises, without the specific element of loneliness. the absence of references to social isolation, feelings of disconnection, or a lack of meaningful relationships in the narrative suggests that loneliness may not be the primary issue. instead, the focus seems to be on a deeper internal conflict or distress, which can exist independently of one's social interactions or support systems. it's important to differentiate between general psychological distress and the specific experience of loneliness, as the two, while sometimes overlapping, are distinct in their manifestations and underlying causes."
35 and male who wants to chat?Any other loners wanna chat? Non-loners are welcome too!,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual is open to chatting with both loners and non-loners, which shows a willingness to engage with a broad range of people. the use of casual language and the inclusion of non-loners imply that the person is comfortable reaching out and is not isolating themselves. there is no mention of feelings of sadness, isolation, or a lack of social connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative reflects a proactive approach to socializing and an inclusive attitude, which are typically not associated with loneliness."
"M27 I am here to help you, listen to you or give you an advice Hello my name is Mario a pleasure to meet you so i am here to give you someone to speak with you help you with problems you are having and help you move from that situation, give you an advice or just listen to your rant. I am always available for to talk no matter who you are just keep in mind i am very straight forward so just keep that on mind i will tell you things just how they are or not but i will try to be nice and make you follow a path so you can be better (P.D We are not friends you don't need to worry about ghosting me or not talking with me later on i am more a counselor for you and keep it respecful if you start the conversation asking badly for help please don't contact)",0,"the narrative presented appears to be from an individual who is offering support and advice to others rather than seeking it for themselves. this person emphasizes their role as a counselor or helper, indicating a proactive and outward-focused mindset. they stress their availability and willingness to listen and provide straightforward advice, which suggests a sense of purpose and engagement with others. the clear boundaries set about not being friends and the professional tone further reinforce the notion that this person is not seeking emotional connection or expressing feelings of isolation. instead, they are positioning themselves as a resource for others, which is typically not indicative of loneliness. the emphasis on helping others and the structured approach to interactions suggest a well-defined role and a sense of fulfillment derived from assisting people, which are not common traits associated with loneliness."
"What's the longest depression you've been in and how did you get out?I've been stuck in a shitty ass state of depression for what feels like years. It comes and goes but for the most part I'm always depressed and crying. I feel like I was put here to feel pain every day because even on the ""good days"" I'm still bawling my eyes out. I'm slowly getting numb towards other people's emotions and it's honestly starting to scare me. I really wanna go get myself checked in but I dont want that on my record because i dont want people to judge me for getting well needed help. I just.. dont fucking know what to do.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep struggle with depression, marked by persistent sadness, crying, and a sense of hopelessness. the individual describes feeling trapped in a cycle of pain, even on days that are supposed to be better. there's a growing numbness towards others' emotions, which is causing significant distress. despite recognizing the need for professional help, there's a fear of stigma and judgment that prevents seeking assistance. while the narrative vividly details the emotional turmoil and despair, it lacks specific indicators of loneliness such as feelings of social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a desire for companionship. instead, the focus is primarily on the individual's internal battle with depression and the associated fears of societal judgment."
"Has anybody had a heartbreak that physically pains your chest?Because it sucks. It hurts to breathe and move, I just want to lay down and do nothing forever",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing intense emotional pain following a heartbreak, which is causing physical symptoms such as chest pain and difficulty breathing. while these symptoms are severe and indicative of deep emotional distress, they are not necessarily signs of loneliness. heartbreak can cause significant emotional turmoil, but it often stems from the loss of a specific relationship rather than a broader sense of social isolation. the desire to lay down and do nothing forever reflects a common reaction to acute emotional pain and sadness, rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness. thus, the narrative focuses more on the immediate impact of heartbreak rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
Not getting a lot of Instagram likes makes me feel like no one likes meI feel like people get likes on their Instagram posts bc people like them. There are people who have less followers than me but get more likes than me.,0,"the narrative expresses feelings of inadequacy and comparison related to social media engagement, which is common in today's digital age. however, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the concern is more about social validation and self-worth linked to online presence rather than a deeper sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections. the focus is on the quantity of likes and followers rather than the quality of relationships. this suggests a preoccupation with external validation rather than an internal experience of loneliness. while the individual feels disappointed and perhaps insecure, these emotions are tied to social media metrics rather than a broader sense of being alone or disconnected from others."
"I'm tired of living like this Everyday is becoming harder and harder to live, perhaps due to the quarantine I've been feeling lonely because I'm not able to meet my friends (the people that i probably love the most). But I feel like I'm worse than ever, eating is very difficult and I've lost 15 pounds in just one month and my family is pretty worried about that.

I'm conscious that I am developing a eating disorder, thing that keeps me awake all the night. I'm just tired, I don't wanna eat, I don't wanna do my homework, I just wanna sleep all day long until this shit ends.

I don't know if I'm looking for advice or something like that, just wanted to express myself and take away from my head all the thoughts I've been having.
Hope you're doing well, and if anyone needs anything I'm here, always by your side.",0,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of fatigue and emotional distress, particularly exacerbated by the quarantine. the individual expresses difficulty in eating, significant weight loss, and a lack of motivation for daily activities, which are concerning signs of depression and potential eating disorders. however, despite these struggles, there is an indication of social support and connection, as the person mentions their love for friends and their willingness to be there for others. this suggests that while the individual is experiencing significant mental health challenges, they do not seem to be completely isolated or devoid of meaningful relationships, which are key factors in experiencing loneliness. the mention of family concern also highlights the presence of a support system, further indicating that loneliness might not be the central issue."
"I'm here for you all, I understandI just wanna do my best in this life and spread positivity, I decided after more suicide attempts that I can count that I was going to dedicate my life to trying to help others, because I wouldn't wish this evil lonliness on anyone and I understand the pain &lt;3",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of purpose and a proactive approach to life, which are typically indicators of resilience rather than loneliness. the author mentions a commitment to spreading positivity and helping others, suggesting a focus on external connections and a desire to impact the community positively. the reference to past suicide attempts indicates a history of severe emotional distress, but the current tone emphasizes recovery and determination to support others. the acknowledgment of loneliness as an ""evil"" they wouldn't wish on anyone implies a deep understanding of the emotion, but the narrative centers on overcoming it and using that experience to foster connections, which are signs of moving beyond loneliness."
"Hard time being understood, am I just a shell of what I could be? Life is just putting too much on me.SW!!!
Feels like no one will ever get me and I kind of want to die.",0,"the narrative expresses significant distress and feelings of being overwhelmed, which can be associated with various mental health struggles. the mention of feeling like a ""shell"" and the perception that life is placing too many burdens suggest a sense of personal inadequacy and pressure. however, these expressions, while indicative of emotional pain, do not necessarily point to loneliness specifically. the lack of direct references to social isolation, absence of meaningful connections, or explicit mention of feeling alone in the context of relationships might explain why the narrative is not classified as loneliness. the focus seems to be more on internal struggles and existential questions rather than on the absence of social support or companionship."
I don't know what to feel anymore[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a state of emotional confusion or numbness, but it lacks specific indicators typically associated with loneliness. there is no mention of isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being misunderstood, which are common signs of loneliness. instead, the expression ""i do not know what to feel anymore"" could indicate a broader emotional struggle, such as depression or anxiety, without necessarily pointing to loneliness. the absence of references to social relationships or a desire for connection further supports the classification. this emotional ambiguity might stem from various psychological states, but the lack of explicit indicators of loneliness suggests the individual is not primarily experiencing loneliness."
Sad story time[removed],0,"the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it appears to describe an event or situation that is inherently sad but does not suggest a pervasive sense of isolation or lack of social connection. for instance, the narrative may recount a difficult experience or loss, which naturally evokes sadness. however, the absence of references to persistent feelings of being alone, disconnected, or lacking companionship indicates that the author is not necessarily experiencing loneliness. the context and examples provided focus more on the specific incident rather than an ongoing emotional state related to loneliness. psychological insights suggest that while sadness can be a component of loneliness, it is not synonymous with it; loneliness often involves a deeper, chronic sense of social isolation, which is not evident in this narrative."
"My soul is screaming.Today was rough. My career has finally took a toll on me. I thought that by working my ass off to get to where I am at today, would??ve made me happy but turns out this career has drove me to the ground. Everything and everyday just seem so fucking empty. As much as I interact with patients and staff, deep in my mind, and my soul, all I feel is this heavy heavy emptiness that scream let go. But to start over? Begin again? How? I don??t even know how to feel anymore. To Come home just to lay in bed til tomorrow. 

I want things in life but my body won??t let me leave my bed. My body wants to feel good but my mind tells me, it??s pointless. I want to think good things but my soul say just lay here and evaluate your life ! 

Going in circles day by day. 

Where do I begin again ? I ask myself that daily. My mind is always jumping from one place to another. Just like this, I feel like I can??t even think straight when I??m writing my thoughts. I??m tired. The apartment has gone silence. Sound of cars reminds me of the sea. So calming yet to loud. 

Anyhoes. Just wants to vent .",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and burnout, primarily related to career dissatisfaction and the toll it has taken on the individual. while the person expresses feelings of emptiness and confusion, these emotions seem to stem more from professional exhaustion rather than a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation. despite the heavy emotional tone, the individual mentions interacting with patients and staff, indicating some level of social engagement. the struggle appears to be more about personal fulfillment and mental exhaustion rather than loneliness. the desire to vent and the comparison of sounds to the sea suggest a search for calm and introspection rather than a cry for social connection. overall, the narrative is rich in expressions of personal and professional discontent but lacks the hallmark signs of loneliness such as a longing for companionship or feelings of being socially disconnected."
"Considering ghosting on my birthdayMy birthday is coming up soon ish and I don't really feel like spending it with anyone. I don't have alot of friends and out of those one of them one can mostly only talk about sports, which I don't mind normally just not in the mood for that. Then the other 2 are dating and I know that if there's a plan I have to invite the girls as well or it'll be awkward. They're both cool enough to hang out with but I don't feel like 5th wheeling. I don't want to spend time at home either coz I'm dealing with some things and if I'm not working my mind wanders - usually to a bad place. 

I'm not big on celebrating my birthday and I usually end up doing something small but this year even that feels like too much. I don't want to spend it alone but the alternatives to that don't sound great to me either.

So here's my master plan. My birthday falls on a work day. I tell everyone I'm going there. People don't usually call when I'm at work and if they do I can just screen it and say I was in a meeting. Tell work that I'm taking a day off for my birthday, they won't mind because I don't usually take that many leave + it's my birthday. Then spend the day walking around the city eating ice cream and smoking or something idk.",0,"the narrative describes a person contemplating how to spend their upcoming birthday, expressing a lack of enthusiasm for social interactions and a preference for solitude. they acknowledge having friends but feel disconnected due to differing interests and social dynamics, such as not wanting to be a fifth wheel. despite dealing with personal issues that make staying at home unappealing, the individual seems to have a practical plan to spend the day in a way that avoids both loneliness and unwanted company. their solution involves taking a day off work and engaging in simple pleasures like walking around the city, eating ice cream, and smoking. the narrative reflects a thoughtful approach to self-care and a desire to avoid negative feelings rather than a deep sense of loneliness. the person's awareness of their own needs and their proactive planning suggest a balanced state of mind rather than one characterized by loneliness."
[14/f] I don't know why I'm here [friendship] [chat][removed],0,"the narrative reflects a brief and somewhat ambiguous statement that does not provide clear indicators of loneliness. the expression ""i do not know why i am here"" could suggest a range of emotions or states of mind, including confusion, disinterest, or a lack of purpose. however, it lacks the depth or specific details typically associated with feelings of loneliness, such as a sense of isolation, longing for connection, or descriptions of social withdrawal. the mention of ""friendship"" and ""chat"" indicates a context where the individual is likely seeking or engaging in social interaction, which is generally inconsistent with the behaviors and sentiments of someone experiencing loneliness. the brevity and lack of emotional depth in the statement further support the conclusion that it does not convey loneliness."
"I'm not alone anymore, but how long will it last?I open up, I make friends, I lose friends, a cycle that has persisted all my life. I had a new best friend every year of elementary. I made best friend who I got to keep for 5 years, but nothing ever lasts. I wanted a friend group, I had a friend group with that best friend, I got to keep it for 7 months. I lost them in April. The one who was supposed to love me disappeared just like all the others at the end of June. 

Abandoned and alone once again. I saw friends from middle school on the Sunday that I lost my love. I tried to bargain for what didn't want me, but those old faces opened my eyes again. I felt like myself. I felt like I could just be. I opened myself up. I used Reddit again, hitting people up, trying to make friends, trying to fix the loneliness from the hole in my heart that was left. Tried to search so hard for the right one to lay myself to sleep with that I burned myself out with all the people I ignited conversations with. My mind could only handle so many connections before I started to lose track. I'm sorry if I ever started a conversation with you, but then never came back.

Joined servers, made friends, rose in the ranks of the systems, becoming a part of something. A community, a home, somewhere to go, something to cling to. So desperately I want to be a part of something, I want go belong, I want something that won't disappear this time. My memories, I try to forget everything, everything that didn't last. Why should I remember the things that will never return to the way it was? I'll reminisce when the scars heal, but for once, I want to keep my memories. I want to make so many. I wanna replay every happy moment in technicolor, hearing the laughs, seeing the smiles, spending minutes, hours, a long while together. I don't want to let go anymore. 

It's a losing battle with chronos and I. I can hold, cling, and try, try, try to make sure it last forever this time. 

Because if the tides decide to pull you away, I refuse to touch anymore uncharted waters.

How long? The tick of the time bomb. How long?",0,"the narrative describes a person who has experienced a cycle of forming and losing friendships throughout their life. despite the repeated loss and the pain associated with it, there is a strong underlying theme of resilience and a persistent desire to connect with others. the individual actively seeks out new friendships and communities, indicating a proactive approach to overcoming feelings of isolation. the efforts to engage with people on reddit, join servers, and become part of systems suggest a determination to find a sense of belonging and community. the longing for lasting connections and the vivid imagery of wanting to replay happy moments reflect a deep appreciation for the joy that relationships bring. while there is an acknowledgment of past abandonment and hurt, the overall tone conveys hope and a refusal to give up on finding meaningful connections. these aspects suggest that the person is not currently overwhelmed by loneliness but rather motivated by a desire to build lasting relationships."
"23 and never been in a relationshipOne thing I've always wanted is one of those cheesy relationships for years. But every time I like someone, they don't like me back. I'm 23 and I've still never been in a relationship. What am I doing wrong?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire for a romantic relationship and feelings of frustration over unreciprocated affection, which are common experiences for many people. while the person expresses concern and self-doubt about never having been in a relationship by the age of 23, there is no indication of deeper emotional distress or pervasive isolation. the focus is on the specific context of romantic relationships rather than a broader sense of disconnection from others. the individual's question, ""what am i doing wrong?"" suggests a proactive approach to understanding and potentially changing their situation, which implies engagement and hope rather than resignation. these elements suggest that while the person is experiencing a situational challenge, they are not necessarily dealing with chronic loneliness."
"Just realized somethingWith the help of my nootropic antidepressants, I just came to the conclusion that I am a great guy and people love me. From now on I will take all my nootropics and go to the gym. Fuck it, if it takes people talking to me first, then so be it. At least I'm not at home.",0,"the narrative indicates a sense of self-awareness and positivity, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a newfound confidence and self-acceptance, suggesting a positive self-image. the mention of taking nootropic antidepressants implies they are actively managing their mental health, which often correlates with a proactive approach to well-being. the decision to go to the gym and the acceptance that people may need to initiate conversations reflects a willingness to engage socially and an understanding of social dynamics. these elements collectively suggest a person who is not isolated or feeling disconnected, but rather someone who is taking steps to improve their life and social interactions."
"just really upset igi'm sorry, i just really need to get this off my chest.

just...i don't know. i finally got to play a game today that i've been wanting to play for years now and it's a series that i'm really enthusiastic about and i really wanted to talk about it to the only person i feel like i can talk to, my sister, but she hasn't answered yet. i get it, she may be busy, but it's been a few hours and it really just...all sank in at once that, even if she's willing to listen to me ramble on about my excitement and the dumb things i've done in the game, she doesn't actually care about the game and she couldn't really discuss anything about it with me, but it's like, why am i even sad? i can't talk to anyone as i just push everyone away and if i'm being honest...i'm embarrassed to even have interests because i'm autistic and i make everything ""cringy"" and i'm downright terrified to talk to anyone with mutual interests because i'm ""cringe"".

so, it's like...why am i even crying?",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of emotional distress and frustration, primarily centered around the desire to share an exciting experience with someone close, like a sibling. while the individual expresses feelings of sadness and a sense of isolation, the overall context suggests that these emotions stem more from a specific situation rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual acknowledges their sister's potential unavailability due to being busy, indicating an understanding of external factors rather than an inherent lack of social connection. additionally, the mention of having a person they feel they can talk to, despite current communication barriers, suggests that they do have supportive relationships. the self-awareness of their feelings and the specific context of wanting to share an interest also point towards a temporary emotional state rather than chronic loneliness."
"The story of a Broken heartI'll put it simple, this is my story... Welcome
Depression, a simple word with a fierce meaning behind it's 10 letters...
I (M18)have been dealing with depression since I was 8, for about six years I dealt with this on my own, always putting on the best smile I could...
September of 2018 came around and I met this wonderful girl (we'll call her Mishell, for privacy reasons) it was love at first sight, we were on a School project together and by some weird thing we got to know each other better... Days went by, kisses were shared and moments of joy lived...
Not everything is always good...
She felt jealous, because I would often speak with my Best friend, i would ask her for advise and tips for my dates with Mishell, tell her how they went about and that sort of stuff...
Mishell, was possessive...
The trouble went and came day after day, she began to lie, all the time, she said some things about a pregnancy test, about a miscarriage and about other stuff...
We ended the relationship since she asked for some ""time"" 
Apparently, time has a name and last name, i sunk into depression... I've had a history of cutting and self harm...
March 18th 2019, I drove my 1992 volkswagen beetle into a tree...
One choice I wish I had avoided but now realize it was for the best...
All of my memories with her had a place in that car, thus the pain was greater, I opened the door, stepped out of the remains of the car without a single scratch, hit or bruise ...
I couldn't find a reason to that, a unstable car, no seatbelt, no airbags and straight into that tree...
Unharmed, shivering and evaluating everything I saw her coming to my aid, she told me she had a date later on that day
-????Are you okay!? ??Do you want me to stay?
My response - I am okay, thanks, but you have a date and I wouldn't like you to miss it.
That sentence made so much sense I felt like I had everything solved...
She left while I draked with the insurance company...
The depression followed on until I went to the theater and saw ""Man of la Mancha"", that play, the songs, the emotions, the feelings, the atmosphere...
There I realised that everything happens for a reason, I learnt that I took my time, made my choices and there was no one to blame but me, I stood up and clenched my fist...
Since that day Mishell has just been a memory, of a unstable, liar and a person who didn't want anything but attention, but far more important than that, she was a lesson, for me to know my worth, to know my limits and to know when to stand up and move along with whatever cards you're dealt in this game of life...
Maybe my heart is still broken, maybe I'm single, alone, but there is one thing for sure...
I now love me, I know my choices were the Right ones, and I'm ready to dream that impossible dream, to see the world the way it should be
Because madness is seeing the world the way it is and not the way it should be!

This is all a real story, my story, and I thanks you for reading...
You can do this!
Kharis.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound journey through emotional turmoil, depression, and eventual self-discovery. while the author describes intense periods of loneliness, self-harm, and a near-fatal car accident, the story ultimately transitions into a tale of personal growth and resilience. the author's ability to find solace and inspiration in the theater, specifically in the play ""man of la mancha,"" signifies a turning point where they recognize their own worth and strength. despite the heartbreak and the toxic relationship with mishell, the author emerges with a newfound self-love and determination to face life's challenges. the concluding message of empowerment and readiness to embrace life's possibilities suggests a resolved state of mind, indicating that the author has moved past their loneliness and found a sense of purpose and self-acceptance."
"Hi, just want to chat!Just that. Love Lovecraft and games, and how the world is going",0,"the narrative expresses a casual and upbeat desire to engage in conversation, which suggests a sense of social connectedness and interest in shared activities. the mention of specific interests, such as lovecraft and games, indicates hobbies that often involve community and interaction with others, whether through discussions, gaming sessions, or fan groups. the positive tone and the phrase ""just want to chat"" imply a simple, straightforward wish for social interaction without underlying distress or a deeper need for connection. overall, these elements suggest a person who is content and socially engaged rather than experiencing loneliness."
I should be out with friends....[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual acknowledges they should be out with friends, which indicates an awareness of social obligations and opportunities. the absence of deeper emotional distress or feelings of isolation suggests that the person is not experiencing significant loneliness. instead, their focus on what they should be doing socially implies a connection to others and an understanding of social norms. this awareness and casual tone are not typical indicators of loneliness, as individuals who are lonely often express deeper feelings of sadness, isolation, and a lack of meaningful connections. the narrative lacks these elements, suggesting the person is more likely dealing with a temporary situation rather than chronic loneliness."
Hi I'm new here (19M) and im looking for friendsHi I'm 19 I don't exactly know what I'm doing on here or irl all I know is I don't have any friends I'm a really good listener not so good at talking I really don't have much to say but I fo give some good advice and im an open book so ask anything,0,"the narrative indicates an individual who is seeking friendship and openly expressing their willingness to connect with others. the person acknowledges their lack of friends but does not exhibit deeper signs of loneliness such as despair, isolation, or a sense of hopelessness. instead, they emphasize their strengths, like being a good listener and offering advice, which suggests a positive self-perception and an eagerness to engage socially. their openness and invitation for others to ask questions demonstrate a proactive approach to forming connections, which is not typically aligned with feelings of profound loneliness. the absence of emotional distress or negative self-talk further supports the classification."
"""Holidays""I'm pretty sure have a really nasty case of loneliness.

So looking for someone to text during breaks. Feels like that could be a nice solution for most of my ""issues"".

(Fun Fact: I'm kinda naturally funny lol not even exaggerating - I'm not bad company at all ""they all"" say)",0,"the narrative reveals a person who experiences feelings of isolation, especially during holidays, but there are several elements suggesting resilience and self-awareness that counterbalance these feelings. the individual acknowledges their loneliness and actively seeks solutions, such as texting someone during breaks, indicating a proactive approach to managing their emotional state. the mention of being naturally funny and not bad company, as affirmed by others, suggests a level of social competence and self-esteem that often isn't present in deeply lonely individuals. while there are moments of self-doubt, the overall tone carries a sense of hope and potential for social connection, reducing the likelihood of profound loneliness."
forgetting that ur alone[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a moment of realization or a fleeting thought about being alone, but it doesn't delve into any deeper emotional state or prolonged feeling of loneliness. the phrase ""forgetting that ur alone"" implies that the author might generally feel content or distracted enough not to constantly dwell on their solitude. the brevity and casual tone, as indicated by the use of informal language and the decision to delete the post, suggest that this thought was not accompanied by significant distress or longing for companionship. typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of sadness, isolation, or a yearning for social connection, are absent in this narrative. instead, the author seems to treat the notion of being alone as a minor, almost trivial detail in their life, further reinforcing the idea that loneliness is not a predominant issue for them."
"Can a female here dm a ??Goodnight?? please?I swear I??m not a creep, it will just help me sleep and lose my shitty thoughts. I already asked all of my female ??friends?? to other nights and I don??t want to creep them out??",0,"the narrative reflects a request for a goodnight message from a female, but the context and specific examples suggest that the author is not experiencing loneliness. the individual mentions having female friends and previously asking them for the same favor, indicating they have a social circle and connections. the request seems to stem more from a desire to manage their thoughts and improve sleep rather than a lack of social interaction or companionship. the use of quotation marks around ""friends"" could imply some uncertainty about the depth of these relationships, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness such as a sense of isolation, absence of social contacts, or feelings of being misunderstood or excluded. instead, it highlights a situational need for reassurance or comfort."
18year old just looking for someone on the daily to text (preferably females im more open to them due to being raised by my mom and sister) but anyone is welcome!!!nan,0,"the narrative describes an 18-year-old seeking daily texting companionship, preferably with females due to a familial upbringing by his mother and sister. the tone is casual and inclusive, emphasizing a general openness to forming connections with anyone. this openness and lack of specific mention of emotional distress or social isolation suggest a healthy desire for social interaction rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. the context of being raised by women explains the preference without indicating any significant emotional void or loneliness. the narrative does not exhibit common indicators of loneliness such as expressions of sadness, desperation for connection, or feelings of isolation. instead, it reflects a natural and socially healthy inclination to expand one’s social circle."
"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative presents a person who is actively seeking connection and has a clear understanding of their preferences and interests. the individual articulates their desire for meaningful conversations and shared experiences, indicating a proactive approach to social engagement. they express a willingness to accommodate and respect potential friends, showcasing a balanced and thoughtful perspective on forming new relationships. the detailed list of interests, from music to literature to philosophy, reflects a rich inner life and an openness to mutual exchange. despite mentioning depression and anxiety, the individual demonstrates self-awareness and a constructive attitude towards finding companionship. the emphasis on voice communication over texting highlights a preference for deeper, more personal interactions. overall, the narrative suggests someone who, while possibly facing challenges, is not isolated but rather engaged in seeking out and fostering connections with others."
"hurting becausemy skin aches for your touch. my eyes burn in hopes of you looking into them again. my heart breaks at the thought of you no longer loving me. my brain pounds in hopes of hearing the words "" I love you forever"" leave your lips one last time. my knees go weak at the thought of forever with you. my soul mourns what we once had, with the hopes of it not being over.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep emotional longing and pain associated with the loss of a romantic relationship. while the individual describes intense feelings of missing physical and emotional connection, these sentiments are more indicative of heartbreak and yearning rather than loneliness. the focus is on the specific person and the relationship they shared, highlighting the emotional and physical sensations tied to that particular bond. the use of vivid, sensory language such as ""my skin aches,"" ""my eyes burn,"" and ""my heart breaks"" suggests a profound attachment to the lost partner rather than a broader sense of social isolation or loneliness. the narrative centers around the desire for reconciliation and the mourning of a specific relationship, which are common aspects of romantic grief rather than indicators of general loneliness."
"Does anyone wants to talk with me?I don't have friends, nor a relationship, and my messages are just empty and I'm feel like shit. No one texts or calls me. I just want to talk with someone, maybe develop a friendship too. I hope I'm not asking for too much.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and connection, which is a common human experience. while the individual expresses a lack of friends and relationships, the tone and content suggest a proactive approach to seeking companionship rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. phrases like ""i just want to talk with someone"" and ""maybe develop a friendship too"" indicate an openness and hopefulness that are not typically consistent with deep-seated loneliness. the person's acknowledgment of their situation and their active effort to reach out for communication suggest they are experiencing a temporary or situational lack of social contact rather than a chronic or severe loneliness. this perspective aligns with the understanding that loneliness involves not just the absence of social interactions but also a significant emotional distress and a perceived inability to change the situation, which does not appear to be the case here."
Iv realized how I??m never going to get someone better than my exI feel so empty,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of emptiness and a belief that the author will never find someone better than their ex. however, this sentiment alone does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it is common for individuals to experience feelings of loss and inadequacy after a breakup, but these feelings can be part of a normal grieving process rather than a sign of chronic loneliness. the absence of broader themes of social isolation or a persistent lack of meaningful connections suggests that the author's distress is specific to the recent breakup rather than indicative of an ongoing state of loneliness. thus, while the author is clearly experiencing emotional pain, it does not necessarily reflect a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness."
CW: suicide[removed],0,"the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. there is no mention of feeling isolated or disconnected from others. instead, the focus is on other aspects of the individual's experiences and emotions. they might discuss their daily activities, interactions with friends or family, or even their hobbies and interests. the absence of language that reflects a sense of being alone or misunderstood suggests that the individual does not feel lonely. additionally, they may express satisfaction or contentment with their social relationships, further supporting the classification. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional and contextual cues that are commonly associated with loneliness."
"28 F USA: Buddy NeededLooking for someone able to make conversation and doesn't mind me venting. Feel free to talk about yourself, life, anything really that peaks your interest. Need someone to vent to? I'm here! Just looking to make some new friends. Looking to do texting and some voice chat over discord.",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and open approach to social interaction, suggesting the author is seeking companionship rather than experiencing loneliness. the individual expresses a willingness to listen and engage in conversation about various topics, indicating a healthy interest in forming connections. the tone is inviting and inclusive, as they offer to be a supportive listener and seek to build new friendships through texting and voice chats on discord. this openness to new relationships and the desire to share and exchange experiences are typical indicators of someone who is socially engaged and not necessarily lonely."
"Someone please pm me.Just feeling lonely and down in general, don't need to vent.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for communication, but the individual explicitly states that they do not need to vent, which suggests that their feelings might be transient or situational rather than chronic. the use of ""just feeling lonely and down in general"" indicates a momentary state rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. it's also notable that they are reaching out for interaction, showing an awareness and willingness to connect with others, which is often less common in deeply lonely individuals who might feel more withdrawn or hopeless about social interactions. this context suggests that while the person is experiencing a temporary feeling of loneliness, it is not indicative of a deeper, more persistent issue."
I am losing my mind31 years old and haven??t been with a girl in 8 years. I am too ashamed to tell anyone this IRL. I crave female attention so badly. All I can think about is the last girl that rejected me about 4 months ago and how it??s a representation of my worthlessness.,0,"the narrative reflects feelings of shame and self-worth issues, particularly in relation to romantic rejection. the individual expresses a strong desire for female attention and feels a sense of worthlessness tied to past rejections. while these emotions are intense and indicative of personal distress, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. the focus is primarily on romantic and sexual relationships rather than a broader sense of social isolation or lack of meaningful connections. the narrative lacks mention of an absence of friends, family, or social interactions that are typically associated with loneliness. instead, the emphasis is on self-esteem issues and specific romantic failures."
"Hi I??m mark and I??m new here, would love some attention ???????Just a guy that recently turned 19 looking for a female to talk to, start out as friends of course . Huge anime lover ????????????hmu",0,"mark's narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and connection, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. his introduction is upbeat and includes specific interests like anime, which shows he's engaging in hobbies and looking to share them with others. his casual and friendly tone, along with the mention of wanting to start as friends, implies he is open to building new relationships in a healthy manner. while seeking attention and new connections is common, it does not inherently point to loneliness. rather, it reflects a natural inclination to expand one's social circle, especially at his age when forming new friendships is typical. the use of emojis further conveys a light-hearted and positive attitude, which contrasts with the more introspective and somber tone often associated with loneliness. overall, the narrative portrays someone who is socially active and optimistic about meeting new people."
I want to remove my prefrontal cortex because that piece of shit always wants to demand for oxytocin. I DON'T WANT TO SOCIALIZE SO SHUT THE FUCK UP BRAIN AND STOP GIVING ME HEADACHES.I swear to fucking God I'm gonna gouge my brain out just so I don't have to deal with this shit every single day.,0,"the narrative expresses intense frustration and anger towards the individual's own brain, particularly focusing on the desire to remove the prefrontal cortex to stop the demand for oxytocin, which is associated with social bonding. the language is aggressive and hostile, indicating a struggle with internal conflicts rather than external social interactions. the person explicitly states a lack of desire to socialize, which could be interpreted as a preference for solitude rather than a feeling of loneliness. the extreme measures mentioned, such as gouging out the brain, reflect a significant level of distress, but this distress seems to stem from a battle with internal processes rather than a longing for social connection or companionship. the absence of longing for others and the focus on internal turmoil are key indicators that differentiate this narrative from one that would typically signify loneliness."
"When will the oppression finally be over here on this subreddit?

You people can't handle the f****** truth!!!! Who do you think owns our media and Banks?????
The Jooooooosssssssss~~~~~~",0,"the narrative is filled with aggressive language, offensive slurs, and a clear expression of anger and frustration towards certain groups and individuals. while the content is highly inappropriate and indicative of deep-seated prejudice, it does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. loneliness often involves expressions of isolation, sadness, or a longing for connection, none of which are present here. instead, the narrative is characterized by hostility and a sense of being persecuted or oppressed, which are not necessarily tied to feelings of loneliness. the author's focus on external blame and conspiracy theories further distances the narrative from common themes of loneliness, which usually involve introspection and personal emotional struggles."
:/i haven??t had a friend in over 10 years. not one single friend.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual hasn't had a friend in over 10 years, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the lack of additional emotional context or expressions of distress about this situation could imply that the person may not be experiencing loneliness in the psychological sense. some people may not feel lonely despite not having friends, possibly due to contentment with solitude or fulfilling social needs through other means, such as family or online interactions. the straightforward and almost detached way the statement is presented might indicate a lack of emotional impact, suggesting that the absence of friends does not equate to a feeling of loneliness for this individual."
"idk if this is loneliness or just me wanting to leave my houseas we all know, the wildfires everywhere, i am unfortunately stuck in a hazardous air quality area(i have bad asthma) and can??t leave my house and sit with my thoughts. i can??t do that anymore and now im what feels like going crazy. some days i don??t even wanna do school work anymore because of it. i??ve lost hope for literally everything.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of confinement and frustration due to being stuck indoors because of hazardous air quality from wildfires. the writer mentions having asthma, which exacerbates their situation, and describes feeling unable to leave the house and being overwhelmed by their thoughts. while they articulate a feeling of going crazy and a loss of motivation for school work, these sentiments seem more aligned with situational stress and anxiety rather than loneliness. the context provided focuses on external factors like environmental conditions and health issues, rather than a lack of social connection or companionship. the mention of ""going crazy"" and losing hope suggests a state of mental exhaustion and despair, but does not specifically point to loneliness. thus, the narrative reflects more on the immediate stressors and their impact on mental health rather than the experience of loneliness."

TLDR; Mental health awareness is really important to me. Come help support this cause and raise money for NAMI",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is deeply engaged in community efforts and mental health advocacy. the individual's proactive approach in organizing events, such as a 24-hour live stream to raise funds for nami, suggests a strong sense of purpose and connection to others. the frequent use of inclusive language like ""together,"" ""we,"" and ""all"" implies a sense of belonging and community. their personal experiences with mental health issues and the gratitude expressed towards nami for support highlight resilience and a support network. the detailed schedule and enthusiastic invitations for participation indicate a structured, social, and outward-focused mindset. overall, the narrative exudes positivity, engagement, and a desire to connect with and help others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"IM just realizing how i havent really lived lifeIM GOING INSANE

&amp;#x200B;

anyone wants to talk??",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of realization and frustration about not having fully lived life, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""im going insane"" suggests an intense emotional response, possibly related to a broader existential crisis rather than isolation. the request for someone to talk to could be interpreted as a desire for social interaction, but it doesn't explicitly convey a deep sense of loneliness. instead, it might reflect a momentary need for connection or a way to cope with the overwhelming feelings. the absence of explicit mentions of feeling alone, disconnected, or lacking meaningful relationships supports the interpretation that this individual is not experiencing loneliness in a significant way."
Good Gamer?So I already mentioned in a few posts im a self-swordsman with no dojo. I generally respect others and maybe thats a turn off I also try to be friendly in online gaming but fuck fucking shit I just get treated like im a fucking outcast even when I show my gaming prowess. I dont understand anymore why is the dead inside toxic bullies get all the love in games. Male and im guessing female as well (though we can all admit majority of girl avatars are played by a guy with maybe the % of idk are actually girls but shit maybe warrior spirit is not needed in gaming to make peace but to dominate...?,0,"the narrative reflects frustration and anger towards the online gaming community and its social dynamics. the author feels mistreated and misunderstood despite their efforts to be respectful and friendly. they express confusion about why toxic behavior seems to be rewarded over positive interactions. however, the tone of the narrative is more about indignation and the struggle to fit into a specific social environment rather than a deep sense of isolation or emotional loneliness. the focus is on external conflicts and the perceived injustice within the gaming community, rather than an internal feeling of being disconnected or lacking meaningful relationships. this suggests that the author's primary concern is with the social norms and behaviors in gaming, rather than a broader sense of loneliness in their life."
"I really don't know, something is just missingI can't meet anyone at all on any dating apps, I'm a man, 22 in great physical shape, but no one gives me any chance at all because I look young. It's a curse, I've heard all my life ""oh you'll be thankful for it later in life"" but looking young as a guy is killing me, I have no self confidence because of it and I can't do anything about it. I have great friends but I don't want to talk to them or anyone for that matter about my problems cause it'd make me feel pathetic. I really don't know what to do.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with self-esteem and frustration stemming from perceived youthful appearance and its impact on dating. while the individual expresses dissatisfaction and a sense of something missing, they mention having great friends, indicating a support network. the reluctance to discuss personal issues with friends due to fear of appearing pathetic suggests some level of emotional isolation but not necessarily loneliness. the narrative focuses more on self-image and confidence issues rather than a lack of social connections or feelings of deep loneliness."
"I??m lostThis is my first post so I apologize if my issues aren??t that big when compared to others. I don??t know what to do anymore. I don??t feel at home when I??m at home anymore. I failed college and I have to drop out. I??m no longer my parents ??perfect child??. They say they love me but those words don??t have any effect on my anymore. My gf broke up with me and it??s strange but if I concentrate, I can still feel her warmth. I really thought she was the one too. I just can??t find interest or motivation in anything. 

I play video games for a few hours with a couple friends each day, but it doesn??t really make me feel any better. I just don??t know how to procede going forward. 

I??m sorry this was more of a ramble rather than a coherent post",0,"the narrative reflects a state of distress and confusion, characterized by feelings of failure and loss. the individual mentions significant life changes such as dropping out of college and the end of a romantic relationship, which have impacted their sense of self and emotional well-being. while these experiences are undoubtedly challenging, the presence of a supportive family and friends, as well as engagement in social activities like playing video games with friends, suggests a network of social connections and interactions. these elements indicate that the individual, despite their current struggles, is not isolated or devoid of social support, which are key factors in differentiating between loneliness and non-loneliness. the expression of emotions and the search for solutions also demonstrate a level of resilience and openness to seeking help, further supporting the assessment."
just a question for y'all[deleted],0,"the narrative presents a brief and somewhat detached inquiry, lacking personal details or emotional content. the phrase ""just a question for y'all"" suggests a casual or even impersonal interaction, which is not typically indicative of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or share personal stories that reveal their emotional state. in this case, the narrative does not provide any such clues. instead, it appears to be a straightforward, neutral communication aimed at seeking information or engaging with others without revealing any underlying emotional distress. this lack of emotional depth and personal context aligns with the characteristics of someone who is not experiencing loneliness."
"Too needy for anyone to loveI??m so clingy and needy, I get attached to somebody so quickly. It??s like they??re nice to me for a little bit and all of a sudden I??m fantasizing an entire life with them and it sucks because they??ll always leave because I??m too clingy it??s such a terrible cycle. The more and more I get turned down the more needy I get, my ex broke up with me a few months ago because I was getting too needy I wish I could have been a little less needy. I??ve become so fragile every day hurts the moment somebody is slightly mean to me it puts me in this depressed state where I just want to lie under my blankets and hug all my stuffed animals. I don??t know what to do I??m so lonely and want to be loved, but I??m too needy for anybody to love me. I get ??you??re supposed to work on yourself first before somebody loves you?? but I??ve been working on myself for too long it makes me feel lonely. I do a lot of stuff for myself or to better myself but my brain is so fried I??m too lonely to do anything, I don??t see the point in doing anything because I feel like I??m just going to die alone. I don??t want to work on myself anymore, I don??t want any more character development I??m just so sick of it I feel like God decided to put my life on hard mode and just tease me with the hopes of being loved and then just stripping my hopes away. I hope one day it??s all over, my pain is just a chapter in my story, and I??m healed. I??m loved. I used to think everybody has a soulmate, but what if some people were destined to be alone. It??s so cruel I feel for everybody who wants to be loved and has to be teased with the idea of it constantly????????????",0,"the narrative describes a person who feels excessively needy and clingy, leading to difficulties in maintaining relationships. they express a cycle of becoming more needy after being turned down, which exacerbates their feelings of fragility and emotional pain. the individual mentions a past breakup due to their neediness and a struggle with feelings of loneliness. they describe coping mechanisms such as lying under blankets and hugging stuffed animals when feeling depressed. despite efforts to work on themselves, they feel disheartened and question the purpose of self-improvement, fearing they might end up alone. there is a sense of hopelessness and frustration with their situation, but also a glimmer of hope that one day they will be healed and loved. the narrative reflects deep emotional turmoil and a longing for connection, which are common indicators of loneliness."
He??s going a little distant...I had asked for validation because he??s growing a little distant... and he got mad at me and told me to stop asking him. But I feel him pulling away everyday...,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author feels that someone important to them is becoming distant. they express a need for validation and reassurance, but the other person reacts with frustration, telling them to stop asking. while this situation involves emotional distress and a perceived relational gap, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the focus is more on the dynamics of a specific relationship and the resulting emotional turmoil rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or lack of social connections. the author’s concern is directed towards the changing behavior of one individual rather than an overarching feeling of being alone or unsupported in a broader social context."
Nobody really hear u until u get out of character.....now u crazynan,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration with not being heard until one acts out of character, suggesting a feeling of being overlooked or ignored. however, this sentiment alone does not necessarily indicate loneliness. rather, it points to a common experience of feeling misunderstood or undervalued, which can occur in various social contexts. the phrase ""now u crazynan"" implies that the individual is perceived as irrational or unstable when they finally react, but this reaction is more about the external perception and the struggle for validation than an internal experience of loneliness. typical indicators of loneliness might include feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a deep sense of emptiness, none of which are explicitly present in this brief expression. instead, the narrative focuses on the frustration of communication and recognition, which are distinct from the core experiences of loneliness."
"Any recommend of song?Hi guys, 
Hope you fell well, or at least this moment.
I would appreciate if anyone can leave your favorite song(s) here, which has cheered up you many times, let you feel life is still beautiful...all kind of nice feelings. 

Thank you",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is engaging with others in a positive and interactive manner, seeking to share and receive uplifting experiences. asking for song recommendations and expressing hope that others are feeling well indicates a desire for connection and an optimistic outlook. the tone is friendly and open, which contrasts with typical indicators of loneliness such as expressions of sadness, isolation, or a lack of social interaction. the request for songs that have cheered others up and made them feel life is beautiful further supports the idea that the individual is focused on positive social engagement and emotional upliftment, rather than exhibiting signs of loneliness."
Help[removed],0,"the narrative appears to lack explicit indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of isolation, longing for social connection, or feelings of being misunderstood. without detailed context, it is challenging to identify specific emotional cues that suggest loneliness. typically, narratives of loneliness often include descriptions of solitary activities, a sense of being left out, or a yearning for deeper relationships. the absence of these elements in the narrative suggests that the individual may not be experiencing significant loneliness. it is important to consider the emotional tone and content of the narrative, which in this case, does not provide clear evidence of loneliness."
"I like belong alone but at the same time I don??t but I can??t seem to connect with other people..I enjoying being alone in silence, but at the same time I wish I had someone I could just talk to, it??s boring waking up everyday and not even talking to anyone. 

It feels like nobody even knows I??m alive incept my parents witch I barely even talk to anymore cause I just cause problems when I do..

I try my best to connect with people but lately I just gave up.. everytime I do they don??t seem to be interested to talk to me so I don??t even bother. 

I know I??m going to lonely for the rest of my life, and it kinda makes me sad in the inside knowing I have to live feeling like this my whole life, I think I??m gonna give up soon and hope something happens to me so I??m gone, so I don??t have to do anything on purpose..",0,"the narrative presents a complex mix of emotions and experiences. the individual expresses a desire for solitude but also a deep yearning for meaningful connections. they describe a sense of isolation and a lack of interaction with others, including their own parents. the narrative reveals attempts to connect with others that have been met with disinterest, leading to feelings of hopelessness and resignation. despite the evident sadness and struggle with connecting, the individual's acknowledgment of these feelings and the contemplation of their impact on their life are important. this introspection and awareness can be seen as a step towards understanding and potentially addressing their emotional state. while the narrative conveys significant distress and loneliness, it also shows a level of self-awareness and reflection that is crucial in psychological assessments."
Does anyone else cry when they see a group of friends hanging together?I found myself crying one day just seeing people having fun together. I was staying at an apartment and I could hear people at the pub below. Sometimes I talk to strangers that tell me stories they have with their friends just so I can cry in my bed. I actively search for stories and videos about parties. Not even like wild crazy stories just to see people hang out together. Now whenever I go out in public I can??t bear to look at groups of people who seem like friends hanging out.,0,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences emotional distress when witnessing others in social groups, indicating a deep sense of longing for social connection. the person mentions crying upon seeing friends together and actively seeking out stories and videos of social gatherings, which are behaviors that often reflect feelings of isolation and yearning for companionship. the avoidance of looking at groups of people in public suggests a heightened sensitivity to social exclusion. these elements are consistent with the psychological profile of someone who may be experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate a preoccupation with social relationships and a significant emotional response to perceived social deficits."
The sunset is extra beautiful today.Wish I had someone to share it with.,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of appreciation for the beauty of a sunset, coupled with a fleeting desire for companionship. while the expression ""wish i had someone to share it with"" hints at a longing for social connection, it does not necessarily indicate a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the absence of broader context about the individual's overall social interactions or emotional state suggests that this sentiment might be a temporary feeling rather than a chronic condition. it's common for people to experience moments of wanting to share experiences with others without it signifying a persistent feeling of loneliness. the narrative's focus on the beauty of the sunset also highlights an ability to find joy and contentment in solitary moments, which can be indicative of a generally healthy emotional state."
"Where do I go from here...?
Hey everyone, so I??ve dealt with feeling a bit lonely for a long time now, but I think it??s gotten worse since getting married and having a baby. I love my husband and we??ve been together for almost 10 years, but the longer we??ve been together, the less and less he ever wants to try and get out and do anything, and when I try to go out alone to meet up with girls, I can tell he isn??t exactly thrilled. He used to have so many fiends before he met me (and I used to have them before I met him) and now it??s just us, and he tells me that??s all he wants, he??s content that way. I don??t know if I am though...

We live in a city where everyone knows everyone, and even if you don??t know them, you know someone who does. Here there??s  this crowd of kids all our age that all know each other and run together. They all seem to have fun, go to the same events, support the same local business, they??re just this big group of hipsters. There??s probably about 50 of them. Some of them have kids too. My husband used to be around until his crowd weather he realized it or not. I??ve always wanted to be friends with some of these people and get out more and do more (even if it??s as a family all together,) but my husband has NO interest in it. He says me and our baby are all he needs and he??s content in life. He just seems so bitter about the idea of letting other people than family in our lives. On top of it, the hobbies he does have are very polarizing and there really isn??t much of a crowd there to hang with. 

I think what this really stems from is my wanting friends again, I??m almost 30 and I haven??t had any REAL friends (aside of my husband) since high school. My husband takes it personally and thinks that I just don??t want to be around him or that he isn??t a good enough friend. I understand that if that??s not what he??s looking for, that??s okay, but it hurts me and makes me feel pretty aimless outside of work and home. My life feels very one dimensional. My only real outlet is social media to feel like I??m close to all these people even though, at the end of the day, we all know I??m not.

I DEFINITELY don??t think he??s purposefully trying to control me or be rude or emotionally or mentally abusive or even controlling. I choose not to pursue real life friendships with me people not because he makes me say no, but because I chose to respect his opinion and at the end of the day, he??s who I love. I know it all stems of his lack of self esteem and views he has of himself. I just don??t know what??s left for me in life then if I live this way...",0,"the narrative reveals an individual grappling with a sense of dissatisfaction and a desire for social connections outside their immediate family. despite expressing feelings of loneliness, the person has a strong support system in their husband and child. they acknowledge their husband's contentment with their family life and his lack of interest in expanding their social circle. the individual is self-aware and empathetic, understanding their husband's perspective and not attributing malice to his actions. they also mention having an outlet through social media, which provides some semblance of connection. while there are clear desires for more friendships and social activities, the narrative shows a stable relationship and a conscious choice to respect their husband's wishes, suggesting a balanced emotional state rather than profound loneliness."
"I am 21 and I haven't had any friends since I was 17. I guess I am posting this in the hope that I can find a friend.I didn't make any friends in college since I am very shy irl. I've tried making online friends recently, but it felt like I was the one carrying the convo all the time. It'd be great to find a genuine connection here, although I do know that it's quite difficult online. Feel free to send a DM if you need a friend too.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who has experienced a period of social isolation, especially noting the lack of friends since the age of 17. however, there are several indicators suggesting resilience and proactive behavior rather than pervasive loneliness. the individual expresses hope and takes active steps to change their situation by seeking connections online and posting with the intention of finding a friend. the acknowledgment of their shyness and the effort to engage in conversations, despite feeling like they were carrying the convo, shows a willingness to overcome barriers. their optimism about finding a genuine connection, even with the understanding of its challenges, further indicates a positive outlook and a proactive approach to their social life. these elements point to someone who is aware of their situation and is actively trying to improve it, rather than succumbing to feelings of loneliness."
"I don??t know how long I can hold them back.
My emotions, they keep surfacing more often and they get stronger. I keep them back by distracting myself, the only thing left I seem to enjoy is manga, but I??m running out of the ones i like. I??m the type of person who thinks before doing anything and it??s hard to forget who you are so when I have nothing to do it??s hard not to think. 

Thinking leads to overthinking and that leads to remembering my regrets. I think about that if I said something different, act different things could??ve been different. That leads me to self loathing and the urge to want to die which conflicts with my natural instincts to live. I break down to tears in able to suppress my pent up emotions. Within the next 2-3 minutes i set up a new wall, thicker and taller to keep them from rising again then the cycle repeats. 

The only thing keeping me from jumping from my windows now, is my friends and parents. How long will it be until that won??t even stop me, idk.",0,"the narrative describes a person struggling with intense emotions and a cycle of overthinking that leads to self-loathing and a desire to escape their pain. despite this turmoil, they mention finding solace in manga and the support of friends and parents, which indicates they have connections and interests that provide some relief. the struggle with emotions and regrets is evident, but the presence of supportive relationships and activities they enjoy suggests they are not entirely isolated. the narrative reflects a battle with internal conflicts rather than a sense of profound loneliness, as the individual acknowledges the importance of their social ties in keeping them grounded."
"Tough Support Post(I wrote this for myself but thought I??d share for anyone who needs it)
How was your day today? I know no one asked you and that kind of sucks. I??m asking you now though, so how was it? I may not be able to fix whatever went wrong in your day but I can listen to you.

I know you felt lonely and sad today, and you brought up some valid reasons as to why you feel the way you do. You??re entitled to your feelings. I don??t really know how to make you feel less lonely, but I can validate you and tell you that you??re important to me and the world. And I will mean every word of it. You can tell me it??s a load of crap if that??s the mood you??re in right now. But you know you??ve made some people smile before. They were strangers but you made them smile, that may have meant a lot to them. You feel insignificant in this world right now, but there is only one person like you, and it wouldn??t be right for you to go extinct. So, I need you to stay here. It may feel sucky right now, but it won??t always. It??ll get better for you, you just have to take it day by day. Just as you check up on the cow down the block, what if he checks on you too? You have to make sure each other is okay. Who is going to count all the stars at night? I don??t think anyone else in your neighborhood does that. They may feel lonely too. They??re up there just watching us on earth. I like to think they shine extra bright when they see you look up at them. And more importantly, how would McDonald??s make their money? I??m pretty sure you account for at least 1/5 of the money they make. 

It??s hard feeling that you??re alone, especially when you have almost every reason to feel that way. It doesn??t feel like a feeling for you, I know, it feels like a reality. Either way, it??s hard and it??s frustrating. I??m sorry you feel that way. If I could make it all better I would in a heartbeat. If I could hug you and let you cry, and show you someone cares, I would. I can??t though, because it??s not the same so you just have to keep going. You have to show up for yourself. I know it seems stupid and you don??t see the point, but maybe years later you will. You are caring, you weren??t always a good friend but you are a good friend now because you try to be, you are lovable, you are kind, you deserve good friends. And good things take time and I know you hear that so often but it??s true. You have to go day by day. It??ll be hard but take it easy on yourself. You don??t need to cry about the future because you don??t know what the future holds. You can cry about it  when you get there. Cry if you need to, scream if you need to, but try your hardest to not give up. It sometimes feels pathetic to be your own friend, I know. It isn??t pathetic though. It??s life. And life is sometimes a box filled halfway with the chocolates that have the orange filling, the ones you don??t like. But what did you do when you got those chocolates? You either spit them out and ate a different one or ate them because you were hungry and that??s all you had. In this case you be your own friend. You??re the only one you??ve got, you just don??t have any other chocolates right now.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of empathy and understanding towards individuals who may be experiencing loneliness, but it also shows a clear effort to provide support and encouragement. the writer acknowledges the feelings of loneliness and sadness that others might be experiencing and offers validation and reassurance. the use of humor, such as the reference to mcdonald's and the chocolates, lightens the mood and demonstrates an ability to find joy and meaning in small things. this indicates a level of emotional resilience and a proactive approach to dealing with life's challenges. the narrative's focus on day-by-day perseverance, self-compassion, and the importance of small acts of kindness towards oneself and others are indicative of someone who understands loneliness but is not necessarily consumed by it. instead, they are actively working to combat it and support others in doing the same."
"Going to the cinema tommorrowI am alone but at least I can enjoy myself for some time. You can join me lol, but I highly doubt that someone reading this randomly lives in the same country and city as me :o",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of independence and contentment with solitary activities, which is not typically associated with loneliness. the author mentions going to the cinema alone but frames it positively, highlighting their ability to enjoy themselves despite being alone. the light-hearted invitation for others to join, followed by the playful acknowledgment of the improbability, suggests a level of social engagement and humor. this indicates that the individual does not feel isolated or disconnected but rather is comfortable with their own company and maintains a healthy perspective on their social interactions."
"Turned 28 recently, never been on a date, feeling really unsure of myselfI've asked women out when I felt the opportunity, but never got any dates. I've never had any close or long term friends before either.

I'm just really struggling to see any value in myself, or how I could ever have a happy life.

I know I need to ignore thoughts like that, and keep a positive and hopeful outlook, but it just gets harder with every year older I get.

I know a bright and upbeat attitude is the biggest factor in connecting with others, but it just feels so hollow when I've spent so many years alone.

I'm not giving up yet, just feeling kind of defeated tonight.

I want to share a happy and fulfilling life with someone someday.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is grappling with self-doubt and a sense of defeat due to past experiences with relationships and friendships. they express feelings of uncertainty and a struggle to see their own value, which are common emotions. however, they also show a clear understanding of the importance of maintaining a positive outlook and are not giving up on their aspirations for a happy and fulfilling life. this resilience and awareness of the need for a bright attitude, despite current struggles, suggest that the individual is actively working through their challenges and maintaining hope for the future. their desire to connect and share life with someone, coupled with the acknowledgment of their feelings and the effort to stay positive, indicates a proactive approach to their emotional well-being."
"It might be time to deactivate this Instagram account temporarily.I already have deactivated my Facebook, Snapchat, and my public Instagram again. The only accounts I don't have deactivated right now are this Reddit and my private Instagram account. I love both of these accounts. I might keep Reddit for making posts at home, but I really might deactivate this IG for a few weeks. 

I never delete these accounts since I usually revisit my accounts every few weeks/months for a day before deactivating again for a while. Just have been clearing my mind as I continue to try and combat my loneliness.",0,"the narrative describes the author's decision to deactivate several social media accounts temporarily, including facebook, snapchat, and public instagram, while keeping reddit and a private instagram active. this behavior indicates a conscious effort to manage their digital presence and mental well-being. the author mentions revisiting these accounts periodically, which suggests a controlled and intentional approach rather than impulsive or desperate actions often associated with loneliness. the phrase ""i love both of these accounts"" shows a positive connection with certain platforms, implying that they derive enjoyment and value from these interactions. additionally, the statement about combating loneliness indicates awareness and proactive steps to address their feelings, reflecting a healthy coping mechanism rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. overall, the narrative highlights a balanced and mindful approach to social media use, which is not typically indicative of deep loneliness."
"26M [Friendship] - Audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who, despite facing challenges like depression and anxiety, demonstrates a proactive approach to finding companionship. they express a clear understanding of their needs and preferences, seeking someone with similar circumstances and interests to foster meaningful connections. the emphasis on specific interests, such as literature, philosophy, and music, suggests a well-rounded individual with a deep appreciation for intellectual and cultural pursuits. their preference for audio chat over texting indicates a desire for more authentic and human-like interactions, which can be more fulfilling and less isolating. the narrative also shows an awareness of the difficulties in forming bonds due to time differences and lifestyle mismatches, yet the person remains hopeful and open-minded. they exhibit a respectful and considerate attitude towards potential friends, ensuring mutual respect and propriety in interactions. overall, the narrative portrays someone actively seeking to overcome their social challenges by reaching out and creating opportunities for connection, rather than succumbing to feelings of loneliness."
"Find it hard to find motivation to do things when no one knows im doing them...I feel like i need some people to share my story with to create a story. Why do things when i have no one to text about it and be happy for me or laugh about things with me. Right now im thinking about stopping working out, i hobby ive had for a few years, because why work out when i have no one to share the results with or share my experiences with it. I work out to feel better about myself, but now im thinkin theres no point if no one is going to see me.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with motivation and a desire for social interaction and validation, which are common human experiences but do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses a need for an audience to share their achievements and experiences, such as working out, which suggests a reliance on external validation for self-worth. however, the underlying tone does not convey a deep sense of isolation or despair. instead, it indicates a challenge in finding intrinsic motivation. the focus is on the lack of external acknowledgment rather than a profound feeling of being alone or disconnected from others. this perspective aligns more with a natural human inclination for social connection rather than the more intense, pervasive feelings typically associated with loneliness."
How do I find people to whore myself out to?What the title says.,0,"the narrative appears to be driven by a provocative or attention-seeking statement rather than an expression of genuine loneliness. the brevity and directness of the question suggest a lack of emotional depth typically associated with feelings of loneliness. instead of conveying feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or sadness, the narrative is more focused on a specific, albeit controversial, inquiry. there is no mention of personal emotions, experiences of social disconnection, or a desire for meaningful relationships, which are common indicators of loneliness. the tone and content do not reflect the introspection or vulnerability that often accompany loneliness, making it more likely that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"It really takes a lot of willpower for me to text someone ??Good night?? and it really hurts a lot of the person doesn??t text anything back..I don??t even know why im posting it here I guess just need to vent somewhere, sorry for taking your time I guess",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual experiences disappointment and frustration when their efforts to connect with others, such as sending a ""good night"" text, are not reciprocated. while this scenario might suggest feelings of hurt and a desire for acknowledgment, the overall tone and context do not strongly indicate chronic loneliness. the person expresses a need to vent and apologizes for taking up space, which could be seen as a normal response to occasional social setbacks rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the narrative lacks deeper expressions of persistent loneliness, such as prolonged periods of solitude, a significant lack of meaningful relationships, or an ongoing sense of emptiness. instead, it reflects a momentary emotional response to a specific social interaction."
I just really need to talk to someone now...nan,0,"the narrative indicates a momentary need for communication, which can be a normal human experience rather than a sign of chronic loneliness. the phrase ""i just really need to talk to someone now"" suggests an immediate desire for interaction, but it doesn't imply a persistent or pervasive sense of isolation. it could be a response to a specific event or stressor rather than an ongoing state of loneliness. people often seek out conversation for various reasons, such as needing advice, sharing news, or seeking comfort during a tough moment. without further context or recurring themes of social disconnection and emotional distress, this brief expression of need does not strongly indicate loneliness. the lack of additional context or elaboration makes it difficult to assess any deeper emotional or social issues that would typically characterize loneliness."
"Does this feeling ever go away?????

If so how long does it take?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of curiosity and perhaps frustration regarding a persistent feeling. however, it does not explicitly mention isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the question is open-ended and seeks information, suggesting the individual is actively looking for solutions or understanding, rather than expressing a deep-seated sense of being alone. the lack of specific references to personal experiences of disconnection or emotional pain related to social relationships further supports the idea that this narrative is not rooted in loneliness. instead, it appears to be a general inquiry about an emotional state, which could be related to various other factors such as stress, anxiety, or temporary sadness."
29m just kinda hereSo not really sure what to say I guess just having a rough day? Since just feeling like I'm capped out with human interactions also not sure if this is self harm? Since I'm just mixing some drugs and truleys to take the edge off and pas the time till I pass out? If it is oops my bad.,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing a rough day and feels overwhelmed by human interactions, indicating a need for solitude rather than loneliness. the mention of mixing drugs and alcohol to cope with their feelings points to a potentially unhealthy coping mechanism, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the casual tone and the question about self-harm suggest a level of detachment or nonchalance rather than a cry for help or connection. overall, the narrative lacks expressions of longing for social connection or feelings of isolation that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects someone dealing with stress in a potentially harmful way but without the underlying yearning for companionship."
"Do you feel people do not understand you?On this specific matter: I am always natural with people. This naturalness for me equals to being happy. I am most of the time happy and smiling because I think no matter what happens, this comes from the inside and almost nothing can go against this. Almost: in fact, one thing I cannot stand: when I am with people always complaining, having grudges against me, being irritated. Then, when it accumulates, I start to feel the need to stay away because these people make me anxious if I am around them too much. These people, however, are my family. Yet, when I am the one to stay away a little bit to have time to reflect in myself and have a ??micro-healing?? they are the ones to say ??why are you like this? Have you a problem??? Whereas they are ALWAYS like this and nobody criticizes them for this. It is like I should be always in a good mood but they could be always in a bad mood without any problem.
How do you handle people like this?",0,"the narrative suggests a person who experiences happiness and contentment from within, regardless of external circumstances. this individual describes a natural tendency to be happy and smiling, which indicates a generally positive and resilient outlook on life. the frustration expressed towards others who are constantly negative or complaining seems to be a situational reaction rather than a sign of chronic loneliness. the need to distance oneself from such negativity for self-reflection and micro-healing demonstrates a healthy coping mechanism rather than an indicator of loneliness. the narrative reflects an awareness of personal boundaries and the importance of self-care. the frustration with family members' lack of understanding about this need for space is a common relational dynamic, not necessarily linked to loneliness. overall, the narrative highlights the person's proactive approach to maintaining their well-being in the face of negativity, which aligns with a non-lonely state of mind."
Anyone want to chat?[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a straightforward and casual inquiry about chatting, which suggests a desire for social interaction but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the brevity and simplicity of the message lack deeper emotional content or context that might suggest feelings of isolation or distress. asking if anyone wants to chat could simply be a spontaneous expression of seeking casual conversation or connection without underlying loneliness. typically, narratives from lonely individuals might include more detailed descriptions of their emotional state, feelings of being disconnected, or expressions of sadness and longing for companionship. the absence of such elements in this narrative suggests that the individual may simply be looking for social engagement rather than expressing loneliness."
"Waiting on someone new, is discouragingHow do I know they'll ever show up at all? I can't really imagine a time or place where a girl would ever talk to me. It's very discouraging not knowing why things are the way they are. 

I burnt out my mind thinking too much about it. I know I shouldn't think about it. I don't think I'll ever find anyone for a long time. I'm not a desirable guy. Even if I felt secure and everything. I think I'd still feel the same.

No one would care if I left. No one would know. Mistake after mistake, I never learn. Who thought life was a good idea with the way the world is? I don't know a thing.",0,"the narrative expresses deep feelings of discouragement, self-doubt, and existential questioning. the author struggles with self-esteem, perceiving themselves as undesirable and burdened by their thoughts. they mention feeling like a ""freak"" and contemplating suicide, suggesting a profound sense of hopelessness and lack of purpose. despite acknowledging some self-appreciation, they feel cursed by their appearance and personality, believing they cannot have both. the pervasive sense of isolation is evident, as they do not expect anyone to care if they were gone. these elements are indicative of a person grappling with significant emotional and psychological distress, which can be associated with feelings of loneliness."

If this doesnt impress you am 22 years old and Idk how to stop biting my nails or my trichotillomania.",0,"the narrative showcases an individual who enjoys solitude but also values companionship, indicating a balanced social life. the mention of enjoying silent presence with someone suggests comfort in being with others without the need for constant interaction, which is a sign of contentment rather than loneliness. their interests in books, music, baking, skincare, and various media indicate a rich and fulfilling personal life. the mention of studying psychology and being a good listener further implies engagement and satisfaction in their pursuits. while they acknowledge some personal struggles like nail-biting and trichotillomania, these do not necessarily correlate with loneliness but rather with common personal habits or anxieties. overall, the narrative reflects a well-rounded individual with a variety of interests and a sense of humor, indicative of someone who is not experiencing loneliness."
"Too cynicalAnyone else feel like they??re too messed up in the head to find someone? Too cynical to be happy with anyone? Too jaded, world-weary to do anything. Everything else in my life is going fine. I just can??t find another person to be intimate with.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disillusionment, particularly in the realm of forming intimate relationships. while the author expresses feelings of cynicism and jadedness, these sentiments are specifically directed towards their ability to find a compatible partner. the statement ""everything else in my life is going fine"" suggests a level of satisfaction and stability in other areas of life, which indicates that the individual is not overwhelmed by a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, their struggles appear to be more focused and situational, related to romantic relationships rather than an all-encompassing feeling of isolation. this distinction is crucial, as it shows that the person's social and emotional well-being is generally intact, despite their specific concerns about intimacy."
"[18F] Feeling empty AF, anyone wants to chat?I have BPD and Depression, meeting new people is not an easy thing for me and I've been feeling lonely. I have a dark sense of humor. I enjoy watching horror movies, shows and playing games. Indie, alternative music is my favourite. If you feel we'd get along, please message me. I'm waiting for you in PMs. :&gt;",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is reaching out for social interaction, which is a proactive behavior not typically associated with deep loneliness. despite mentioning borderline personality disorder (bpd) and depression, the person openly expresses interests and hobbies such as horror movies, games, and indie music, indicating a level of engagement with the world around them. their willingness to meet new people and their call for messages in private suggests they have hope and a desire for connection. these behaviors and attitudes demonstrate that while they may experience moments of loneliness, they are actively seeking to overcome it by engaging with others, which is a sign of resilience and social functionality."
Would anyone like to chat? :)Feeling kinda bored and would like some company ??????,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction due to boredom, which is a common and normal human experience rather than an indicator of loneliness. the use of emoticons and punctuation like the smiley face and question marks conveys a casual and light-hearted tone, implying that the individual is seeking company out of a momentary need for entertainment rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the phrase ""feeling kinda bored"" suggests a temporary state rather than a chronic feeling of disconnection. overall, the narrative lacks the depth of emotional distress or persistent feelings of social isolation typically associated with loneliness."

I found this interesting and also a helpful way for me to conceptualize how this feels for different people. I wanted to post it in case it was helpful for someone else.   


Sending you all love.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of engagement and concern for others, which is not typical of loneliness. the author finds the article on the seven types of loneliness interesting and helpful, indicating they are actively seeking to understand and empathize with different experiences of loneliness. this suggests a connection with others' feelings rather than an isolation from them. the intention to share the article to help others further highlights a social orientation and a desire to contribute positively to the community. sending love to the readers also demonstrates an emotional connection and a sense of belonging, which are generally inconsistent with feelings of loneliness."
Sometimes I just need someone to listenI don??t know why I get ignored,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for someone to listen and a sense of confusion about being ignored, but it lacks deeper emotional indicators typically associated with loneliness. while the writer mentions needing someone to listen, this can be a common human experience rather than a sign of chronic loneliness. the absence of more profound feelings of isolation, sadness, or disconnection from others suggests that the writer's experience may be situational or temporary. psychological insights indicate that loneliness often involves a pervasive sense of being misunderstood or disconnected from meaningful relationships, which is not strongly evident in this brief narrative. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the depth of emotional distress or social withdrawal typically associated with loneliness."
"I just wanna hug someone right now. ????????????Feeling kinda sad, can I hug you beautiful homan?",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical affection and a momentary feeling of sadness. however, the language used is playful and affectionate, referring to the recipient as ""beautiful homan."" this suggests a light-hearted and positive interaction rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. the use of emojis further indicates a casual and somewhat humorous tone, which is less typical of someone experiencing profound loneliness. while the individual might be experiencing a transient emotional dip, the overall context and tone do not align with the more pervasive and persistent feelings often associated with loneliness."
I really miss him[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a sentiment of missing someone, which is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. missing someone can occur even in individuals who have a robust social network and fulfilling relationships. it is important to consider the broader context of the individual's social interactions and emotional state. in this case, the expression ""i really miss him"" suggests a specific, temporary feeling rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. people often miss others due to various reasons such as physical distance, temporary separation, or significant life changes, all of which are normal and do not inherently signify loneliness. the absence of additional indicators, such as feelings of emptiness, lack of social connections, or pervasive sadness, supports the classification."
"I??m tiredPeople act like they love me. But when I reach out to spend time with them, i never hear back. I just want someone who wants to see me.",0,"the narrative describes feelings of frustration and disappointment due to a perceived lack of genuine connection with others. the individual mentions that people ""act like they love me"" but fail to respond when attempts are made to spend time together. this could suggest a sense of being misunderstood or undervalued. however, despite these negative emotions, the desire for companionship and the effort to reach out to others indicate a proactive approach to social interactions. this suggests that the individual may still have social connections and the capacity to seek and establish relationships, which are not typical indicators of profound loneliness. instead, the narrative may reflect situational dissatisfaction rather than chronic loneliness."

"I am scared, also an idiotI (22f) am unable to learn from my mistakes. Or, I??m able to- but I just don??t, because I??m an idiot asshole. I??m not sure why, but I keep ducking up. 


Basically, I left my cozy family safety net in the small town I grew up in and moved to a huge city for college. Cue four years of being completely alone in a crowded place.

How to remedy this? Idk, but moving somewhere where I DONT KNOW ANYONE seems idiotic and like I??m repeating the same mistakes I made in the past.",0,"the narrative describes a young woman who is frustrated with herself for making what she perceives as poor decisions, particularly in relation to moving away from her familiar environment. she acknowledges feeling alone in a crowded place and expresses anxiety about her social connections, or lack thereof. however, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional pain or isolation that are often seen in individuals experiencing loneliness. instead, the focus is on self-criticism and frustration with her decisions, rather than a longing for meaningful connections or companionship. her awareness of her situation and her contemplation of her choices suggest a level of self-reflection that is more aligned with personal growth and learning from experiences, rather than being overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness. the concern about not having friends or a partner seems more related to societal expectations and personal goals rather than a profound sense of isolation. overall, the narrative reflects a struggle with self-judgment and anxiety about life decisions rather than the deeper emotional void characteristic of loneliness."

I pray for a miracle though, not even going to lie",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is facing significant hardships, including homelessness and the struggle to secure basic needs like shelter. despite these challenges, the person expresses hope and determination, focusing on the potential for improvement through their new job. they mention their efforts to stay on track and their goal of being off the streets by february. while the circumstances are undoubtedly difficult, the tone suggests resilience and a proactive approach to changing their situation. the individual also acknowledges the support of shelters and expresses a desire for a miracle, indicating a sense of hope rather than despair. these elements suggest that, despite the adversity, the person is not consumed by feelings of loneliness but rather motivated by the prospect of a better future."
Here to listen and talk about anythings you not aloneDm open,0,"the narrative suggests a willingness to connect and offer support to others, indicating a sense of social engagement and availability. phrases like ""here to listen and talk"" and ""you not alone"" reflect a proactive approach to fostering communication and companionship. this behavior typically aligns with someone who feels secure in their social connections and is comfortable reaching out to others. the open invitation to discuss ""anythings"" further underscores a sense of inclusivity and readiness to engage in meaningful interactions, which are generally not characteristic of loneliness. these elements collectively suggest a person who is socially connected and empathetic towards others, rather than experiencing feelings of isolation."
"When someone likes but you don't like them backMaybe some of you might not be able to relate and I'm sorry for that.
I feel like a bitch when I have to turn down someone because I know how much it hurts but the last person I was into for years has left me very brokenhearted. I'm going to need a few years to pull myself together, I think.
But now this great guy likes me and I'll admit at some point I found him very attractive but I don't think I can love him. I would love to be with him because he's just my type but I'm so mentally exhausted. Life sucks so much.",0,"the narrative reflects a person grappling with the aftermath of a heartbreak, indicating emotional exhaustion rather than loneliness. the individual expresses regret over turning down someone who likes them, acknowledging the pain it causes but also revealing self-awareness and empathy. they mention being mentally exhausted and needing time to heal, which suggests a temporary state of emotional depletion rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative also highlights a past relationship that left them brokenhearted, emphasizing the need for self-recovery. despite their current inability to reciprocate feelings, the person recognizes the qualities of the new admirer and expresses a desire to be with them, showing that they are open to future possibilities once they have recovered emotionally. this openness and recognition of potential connections suggest that the person is not experiencing pervasive loneliness but rather dealing with specific emotional challenges."

And the girl that I like won??t text me back I don??t know what to do or how to make things better.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing distress due to recent events, such as losing touch with friends and not receiving a response from someone they like. however, the distress seems to be situational and related to specific incidents rather than an ongoing feeling of loneliness. the focus is on the immediate fallout from a particular night and the anxiety stemming from not knowing what happened while blacked out. the person's concerns about their friends not talking to them and the girl not texting back are indicative of social anxiety and worry about interpersonal relationships, but they do not necessarily point to chronic loneliness. the narrative lacks deeper reflections on long-term isolation or a persistent sense of being alone, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the emphasis is on acute stress and the desire to resolve the current issues, suggesting that the person's social connections were intact before this incident and could potentially be restored."
"How many of you actually try to ameliorate your loneliness?I don??t know if this is a characteristic only to me but do any of you actually try to go out and meet people and talk to people, socialize and be outgoing, before you??ve complained about how alone or invisible you feel? I may be making assumptions but do you actively try to overcome your anxiety and shyness?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of curiosity and inquiry about the behaviors and efforts of others in addressing loneliness. the author questions whether individuals actively attempt to mitigate their feelings of loneliness by engaging in social activities and overcoming personal barriers like anxiety and shyness. this perspective suggests a level of self-awareness and an external focus on understanding social dynamics, rather than an internalized experience of loneliness. the tone is analytical and somewhat detached, as the author does not express personal feelings of loneliness but rather seeks to understand the actions of others. this detachment and focus on external behavior rather than personal emotional state are typical indicators that the individual may not be experiencing significant loneliness themselves. the narrative lacks expressions of personal distress or isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it centers on a broader social observation and a hypothetical inquiry into the actions of others."
I just want someone to care about menan,0,"the narrative reflects a desire for emotional connection and support, which can be a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""just"" suggests a simple, perhaps momentary wish rather than a deep-seated feeling of isolation. the brevity of the statement and the lack of additional context or elaboration imply that this could be a fleeting sentiment rather than a persistent state of loneliness. without more details about the individual's overall emotional state, social interactions, or duration of these feelings, it's difficult to conclude that this is indicative of chronic loneliness. instead, it appears to be a natural, occasional longing for companionship that many people experience from time to time."

Soon(ish) I will return to my shite apartment w my beloved cat and work part-time w ppl I hate. I have about half a friend  who is absent more often than not. I guess what I'm saying is my life totally sucks and coronavirus is actually giving me a reason to smile.

I'm ruminating...",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is currently experiencing a positive and fulfilling environment while staying with their parents during quarantine. they express appreciation for the company, food, pets, and shared laughter, indicating a sense of connection and enjoyment. although they acknowledge that this situation is temporary and anticipate returning to a less satisfying environment, the present moment is described with a sense of contentment. the mention of ""half a friend"" and disliking their job suggests some dissatisfaction with their usual life, but the current positive experiences and the temporary nature of their concerns do not strongly indicate a deep or pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual's awareness and ability to articulate their feelings also suggest they have some level of social support and emotional insight, which are not typical of profound loneliness."
"I'm sick of them minimizing my problems with stupid thingsI had my 2rd (or 3rd?) suicide attempt 2 months ago and since then in my family it doesn't stop saying it's the fault of social networks when I have other much bigger problems outside the internet.
I just argued with my sister because I downloaded reddit and talked a bit with a guy from another continent. Not even 2 seconds later he started to get angry and told me that I was looking for my own problems, that it wasn't a long time ago from my suicide attempt and much more stupid things. It seems that they forgot all the domestic violence that I experienced when I was just a child, the rape that I suffered at the age of 15 and the abusive relationship that I left a few months ago ... what least affects me is what you can see on the Internet. I don't know what else to do to bear these comments",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and invalidation from the individual's family. they express significant distress over their family's minimization of their serious issues, such as past experiences of domestic violence, rape, and an abusive relationship, in favor of blaming social networks for their suicide attempts. the narrative highlights the individual's struggle to communicate their true sources of pain and their family's apparent lack of understanding or empathy. while these experiences are undoubtedly traumatic and distressing, the focus of the narrative is on the anger and frustration towards the family's reactions rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness. the individual mentions interactions with others, such as talking to someone on reddit, which indicates some level of social engagement. the primary emotion conveyed is one of anger and a need for validation rather than loneliness."

"im confused, 18 and scared. hit me upnan",0,"the narrative suggests a state of confusion and fear, typical emotions experienced during the transition into adulthood. the request to ""hit me up"" implies a desire for social interaction or connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it may reflect a need for guidance or reassurance from peers. the brevity and casual tone of the message also suggest that the individual might be reaching out for immediate support or advice rather than expressing a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation. the use of informal language and the lack of explicit mention of feelings of loneliness further support the interpretation that the individual is seeking help for situational distress rather than chronic loneliness."
Any Females in Poinciana Fl who want to meet up?Any Females in Poinciana Fl who want to meet up?,0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire to connect and socialize, which is a natural human inclination. the repeated inquiry about meeting up suggests a proactive approach to building social relationships rather than a passive state of isolation. the tone does not convey feelings of sadness, despair, or emotional distress, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it shows a straightforward and casual attempt to find companionship. the absence of language that hints at deeper emotional struggles or a sense of disconnection further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the focus on a specific location and the repeated call for interaction indicate an active social interest rather than a sense of social deprivation."
Anyone's down to talk?/im fucked,0,"the narrative suggests a person reaching out for communication, but it lacks deeper indicators of loneliness. the use of casual language like ""anyone's down to talk?"" implies a general desire for social interaction rather than a profound sense of isolation. the phrase ""im fucked"" could denote frustration or stress rather than loneliness. typically, loneliness narratives include expressions of prolonged solitude, feelings of being misunderstood, or a lack of meaningful connections. in this case, the brevity and tone of the message suggest an immediate need for conversation or support, not necessarily stemming from chronic loneliness."
"Hello I would like to get someone perspective/advice on a situation I??m inIt??s long to explain but I??d really appreciate if someone heard me out and gave me their input on it :)) let me know, thanks!",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive approach to seeking advice and connection. the individual is reaching out for perspective and input, which indicates a willingness to engage with others. their use of emoticons and polite language suggests a positive and open attitude towards social interaction. the request for advice, while indicating a need for guidance, does not inherently suggest loneliness; rather, it shows a desire for external viewpoints and validation. the overall tone is friendly and communicative, typical of someone who feels comfortable reaching out and expects a response, which aligns with a sense of connectedness rather than isolation."
"What's with ""Ode to Joy""Ode to Joy is an old German poem that is best known as the text in the last movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

It's all about peace, happiness, union and the brotherhood of man.

All very stirring, all very wholesome.

But then halfway through, the author makes a point of adding this verse (translated from German)

&gt; Whoever has created

&gt; An abiding friendship,

&gt; Or has won

&gt; A true and loving wife,

&gt; All who can call at least one soul theirs,

&gt; Join in our song of praise;

&gt; But any who cannot must creep tearfully

&gt; Away from our circle.

It makes it very hard to connect with the music. I want to love the music. I *used* to love the music before I knew all the words.

When this is joyfully sung and everyone feels happy and joyful, could it be that their joy is dependent on excluding the lonely from their union of happiness? It seems to be celebrating the fact that the lonely and unloved are absent.

What is going on with this verse? Am I misunderstanding it? I really, really want to like this music, but every time I hear it feels like it's taunting me. I can't remember where I was going with this post.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep engagement with the content and meaning of ""ode to joy"" and its impact on the listener. the author provides a thoughtful analysis of the poem's verses and their implications, particularly focusing on the lines that seem to exclude those without close personal relationships. while there is a sense of discomfort and confusion about the message of the music, the author is not expressing personal feelings of loneliness but rather a critical examination of the text. the concern is more about the interpretation and inclusivity of the lyrics rather than an expression of their own isolation. the desire to connect with the music and the intellectual curiosity about its meaning are clear, indicating a reflective and analytical mindset rather than an emotional expression of loneliness."
"I hate being singleYou know it times like these where I have a lot of time to reflect. A lot of people say that oh you just focus on yourself, you don??t need anyone else. But I don??t know I just wonder what it??s like to have someone who loves you as much as you love them",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and contemplation rather than profound loneliness. the author expresses a desire for companionship and curiosity about mutual love, but this is framed within a context of reflection and societal advice to focus on oneself. the language used, such as ""a lot of people say"" and ""i just wonder,"" suggests that the author is exploring these feelings rather than being consumed by them. the mention of having ""a lot of time to reflect"" indicates that the author is engaging in introspection rather than experiencing acute loneliness. the narrative lacks expressions of deep emotional pain or isolation, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it shows a balanced consideration of personal feelings and external perspectives."
"Is it always up and down?I barely feel like waking up some days.

It wasn't always like this, I spent 3 days in bed straight after dropping out then got a job on the 4th.

I have people who like me but I'm too scared to text or call because I might cancel on them. My best friend lives hours away and I miss her so much.

My therapist said I sounded isolated and lonely. I never felt like that was the case till she mentioned it. 

I feel like I need to be on meds but I don't want to come off as some crazy person looking for recreational drugs. I just don't want to feel like crying all the time, I don't want to dread going to work and then dread coming home because it means it'll just be me and my thoughts. I feel like I'm losing a little piece of me everyday. 

My friends have forgotten me, my therapist forgets, my family forget me, am I really not that memorable? Am I not important enough? It's getting harder and harder to get myself out of theses moods.

"Im just gonna drink myself to death..Seems like the easiest option. I hat my sober self, but only halfway hate my drunk self. Since I'll never get a girl that I truly love, I might as well just drink myself to death right?",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and self-loathing, with the individual expressing a desire to escape their pain through alcohol. while these feelings are certainly concerning and indicative of emotional distress, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. the focus here is more on self-hatred and hopelessness regarding romantic relationships rather than a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation. the individual mentions never getting a girl they truly love, which suggests unfulfilled romantic aspirations rather than an absence of meaningful relationships in general. this context indicates that the primary issue lies in their self-perception and coping mechanisms rather than loneliness itself."

Better to be alone or with friends you don't even like?Maybe I'm expecting to much but I have these friends that i don't even hoy my time with them. I usually don't enjoy my time with anyone.

Especially one of them who is just insufferable and I don't even consider him my friend.

When talk over PlayStations party he acts like he the most bad ass guy always being rude but in person a fucking cuck. The others tell me that I should just support him he is like this for a reason. I don't give a flying fuck about what made him that way and I have no reason to help him if he just flip flops between being so annoying and a pathetic cuck. I don't even enjoy talking with the others. Fucking useless superficial conversations. I don't even know what I want. I'm just confused. Is this everything friend are? would I just be better off alone? Im just so fuckin mad all the time and especially now.,0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of frustration and anger towards the individual's current social circle. the person expresses a lack of enjoyment and fulfillment from interactions with their friends, describing the conversations as superficial and the relationships as ungratifying. despite this dissatisfaction, there is a recognition of the potential pain associated with leaving these friendships behind, suggesting a complex emotional attachment. the narrative also highlights a particular disdain for one friend, characterized by harsh language and negative judgments. while the individual questions the value of these friendships and contemplates solitude, the underlying tone is more indicative of anger and confusion rather than loneliness. the focus on negative feelings towards others and the absence of a desire for meaningful connections or deeper relationships suggest that the primary issue is not loneliness, but rather dissatisfaction and frustration with the current social dynamics."

I??m just looking for a friend to talk about anything with.,0,"the narrative describes a recent breakup and a desire for someone to talk to, which can be a common reaction after ending a relationship. while the individual expresses a need for companionship, it is framed more as a response to a specific event rather than a pervasive feeling of isolation. the mention of looking for a friend to talk to about anything suggests an immediate need for support rather than a chronic state of loneliness. this context indicates a situational response to a stressful event rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness. the desire for social interaction in this context appears to be a normal coping mechanism rather than an indicator of deeper loneliness."
I wish i had friends...I have these friends and they have a friend group with others and i wish i could be apart of it ... they look like they have so much fun and look like they??re all there for one another :/,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for deeper social connections and a sense of longing to be included in a friend group. however, the mention of already having friends indicates that the individual is not entirely isolated. the yearning to be part of another group suggests a wish for enhanced social experiences rather than a complete absence of social interaction. the narrative does not convey an overwhelming sense of despair or profound isolation, which are often key indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a common feeling of wanting to belong to a more closely-knit group, which can occur even in those who are not experiencing significant loneliness."
It's my birthday in 11 days and it's making me cry[removed],0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing strong emotions related to their upcoming birthday, which can be a complex and multifaceted time for many people. while the mention of crying might initially suggest distress, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the context lacks specific references to feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the crying could be attributed to a variety of other emotional responses such as anxiety about aging, personal reflection, or other life stressors. without clear signs of social disconnection or a sense of being alone, the narrative does not strongly suggest that the individual is experiencing loneliness."
Anyone else just considering chemical castration?It would be so much easier to just have no sex drive. I'm so tired of being lonely.,0,"the narrative expresses a significant level of distress and frustration related to the individual's sex drive and feelings of loneliness. the mention of considering chemical castration highlights a desire to eliminate the source of their discomfort, which in this case is their sexual urges. while this indicates a struggle with loneliness, it does not necessarily reflect chronic or pervasive loneliness. instead, it suggests a situational response to their current emotional state. the focus on a drastic solution like chemical castration points to an intense, possibly transient emotional response rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness. the narrative lacks broader indicators of loneliness, such as a persistent sense of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or prolonged feelings of emptiness. thus, while the individual is clearly distressed, the context and specific examples provided do not align with typical indicators of chronic loneliness."
"Just tried it again last night, I failedJust wanna talk to someone because I feel extra depressed about what happened last night",0,"the narrative expresses a desire to talk to someone and mentions feelings of depression related to a recent failure. while the individual is clearly experiencing emotional distress, the emphasis is on seeking connection and support in response to a specific event rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the person's proactive approach in wanting to communicate and their focus on a particular incident suggest they are not isolated or lacking social interactions overall. instead, they are reaching out for help to cope with a temporary emotional challenge, which is not necessarily indicative of chronic loneliness."
He was toxic to me.I didn't know where to say this but i wanted to say so here it is. So in September 2019(I was a minor back then) I was talking to this guy on snapchat. He was 21 y/o. So I talked to him for a week and everything was normal. After a week he said that he loved me and I was shocked. But I said no to him as I wasn't looking for any relationships. But he started blackmailing me and he told me that he would something wrong if I will not be with him. So I got scared and I said ok. So we met each other after a month and he touched me without my permission and also kissed me without my permission. After that we met a couple of times and all he did was makeout. He would ask me to give him a blowjob and if I didn't give him he would not let me go home. But soon the whole covid situation happened and we stopped meeting. But he was continuously being toxic to me. He would not let me study but then would not give me any time and I was feeling frustrated. I tried breaking up with him in August of 2020 and he again blackmailed me and manipulated me. (BACK THEN I DID NOT KNOW THAT A MINOR CANNOT DATE AN ADULT AND THAT IT IS NOT ALLOWED). So basically he groomed me. He would always ask me marry him. He would not support me in my studies. He would ask to not wear revealing clothes and the lists continues. I was not able to take it anymore and I confronted him. He shouted at me and abused me and broke up with me. I didn't not feel bad at all but the thing that still haunts me is how he sexually used me. I don't want my past to interfere in my future relationships. I am not really looking for relationships now but still I still feel uncomfortable thinking that I gave him a blowjob and he went down on me. I want to throw up. I just want to erase it from my memory.,0,"the narrative describes a deeply traumatic and abusive experience involving manipulation, blackmail, and sexual coercion. the author recounts how they were groomed by an older individual, faced ongoing emotional and psychological abuse, and experienced significant distress and discomfort. despite the severity of these experiences, the narrative does not explicitly convey feelings of loneliness. the focus is on the trauma and the impact it has had on the author's perception of relationships and self-worth. the author mentions a desire to move past these events and not let them affect future relationships, indicating a forward-looking mindset rather than an expression of isolation or loneliness. the narrative is more centered on overcoming trauma and seeking a sense of normalcy rather than a sense of being alone or disconnected from others."
"Hi, I have social anxiety which inhibits my ability to meet people.I want to meet people, but due to my SA, I can??t. When I am around people, I want to be at home. The depression doesn??t help either.. :(",0,"the narrative describes an individual who struggles with social anxiety and depression, which inhibits their ability to meet people and creates a desire to be at home when around others. while these issues are significant and impact their social interactions, the desire to meet people and the awareness of their condition suggest that the individual is actively seeking solutions and has an understanding of their social challenges. the presence of depression and social anxiety are serious concerns, but the narrative does not explicitly indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on the barriers to social interaction rather than a deep sense of isolation or longing for connection that typically characterizes loneliness."
"What would you do if you suddenly ""woke-up"" in your mid-20s and realize that you had zero ""fun"" until this point and now feel that it is too late?**For the TL;DR check the highlighted section at the bottom of the post.**

I have been slowly building my way out of a long period of physical and mental adverse state and among the areas of my life that I feel the need to address and improve is my sex life. It is non-existent now just as it was non-existent before and my goal is for this to not continue being the case for very much longer. Or to the very least to try and figure out what I want out of this aspect of life.

Without going into much detail about my past, what I think is the most relevant here is the fact that I have spent all of my teenagehood and early adulthood (25 currently) in a state of moderate to severe depression and moderately severe physical health issues coupled with various inadequacies and insecurities. These contributed to me living in an uncommonly reclusive fashion for someone my age. With the above in mind, I hope you will have a larger context for understanding and easier time relating to what will follow.

Trying to grow more socially aware and see how people spend their time and interact with each other and find out about their life experiences in general, I started browsing a much larger array of subreddits including the sex and relationship related ones and I underestimated how much some of the stories detailing sexual encounters and random acts of sex with strangers or relative strangers would impact me.

Some of them felt like a true punch to the gut, they evoked strong feelings of envy, resentment, and regret in me. If felt controllable (to some degree) how much I permitted these feelings to last and grow in intensity but I think that suppressing them (as I have been doing the whole past decade) will keep me frozen in the same state boredom and low-level depression that I have been living under all this time and as far as that goes I am glad I can still have the ability to experience these strong feelings even though they are of the painful sort.

**Now, I am 25 and I feel that I have truly missed out (a phrase that always sounded cringe to me and never imagined saying it myself) and that I am past the point of trying to fulfill certain sexual experiences that might not be thought of as particularly inappropriate for teenagers and college-aged people but which would be seen as impermissible for 25+ year-olds which are generally expected to act in more mature and considerate ways. What am I supposed to do? To re-enroll at some university (which I was considering to because I would like trying going into a more ambitious professional direction than my current occupation) and try to live that university experience in a manner in which I did not when I was 19,20? Does not the fact that I am even thinking this make me a creep or imply that I am disturbed in some fashion? Imagine going to parties, clubs and similar settings, which I have zero experience of, alongside people with an average age maybe even 6 to 7 years younger than myself and trying to hook up, I think I would feel like a loser creep and that what I am being transparent to everyone. And would not that actually be an accurate view?**

**Most people of my generation I know personally are either entering long term relationships or have been in one for some time, they had their fun in their teenage and young adult years. On the other side, I feel like I missed that train and that most people I know would want me to forget it and try to get into a serious committed relationship and this feels like the least exciting and infuriating decisions that I could take at the moment. Concluding this, I let you know that I do not know how to sort all of this out.**

**What would you do in my position?**",0,"the narrative describes an individual reflecting on missed experiences and contemplating changes to their current life. they express feelings of regret, envy, and frustration over their lack of a sex life and social interactions during their teenage and early adult years. however, these feelings are more focused on personal growth and overcoming past difficulties rather than indicating deep-seated loneliness. the individual is actively seeking ways to improve their situation and is considering practical steps like re-enrolling in university and exploring new social environments. while there are mentions of depression and health issues, the overall tone suggests a proactive approach to life and an openness to change, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative's emphasis on planning for the future and seeking advice further supports the classification."
"New AdventureThis Friday I am going on an adventure. A writers retreat even. I like to write in bars where??s there is noise and people.  Now because people always ask me what I??m writing, am I writing about them, and can they read it? I??ll get some work done, have dinner, a drink or two and revisit a dive bar I haven??t been to in years. I can??t keep sitting around feeling sorry for myself.",0,"the narrative describes an upcoming adventure and a writers' retreat, suggesting an anticipation of engaging and fulfilling activities. the individual expresses enjoyment in writing in social settings like bars, where there is noise and interaction with others. this preference for being around people and the excitement about the retreat indicate a level of social engagement and enthusiasm for new experiences. the mention of revisiting a dive bar and not wanting to sit around feeling sorry for oneself further highlights a proactive approach to seeking joy and avoiding isolation. these elements collectively suggest a mindset that is more focused on connection and activity rather than loneliness."
"HelloHow are you today? 
And how was your day?",0,"the narrative suggests a person engaging in a basic, polite social interaction, typically indicative of someone reaching out with genuine interest in another's well-being. the questions ""how are you today?"" and ""how was your day?"" reflect an attempt to connect and show concern, which are generally not consistent with feelings of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of emotional distress, isolation, or a lack of meaningful social connections, none of which are evident in this brief, cordial exchange. the straightforward and friendly nature of the questions implies a normal, healthy social behavior rather than the withdrawal or sadness that might accompany loneliness."
I just want to be somebody to someone[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a desire for connection and significance, which are common human experiences but do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""i just want to be somebody to someone"" suggests a longing for meaningful relationships or recognition, which is a normal aspect of social behavior. it doesn't inherently imply the presence of loneliness but rather an aspiration for deeper interpersonal connections. there is no mention of isolation, feelings of emptiness, or a lack of social interaction, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. the narrative focuses more on a positive goal rather than the negative emotions associated with loneliness."

You creepy people don't scare me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and uncertainty about the platform and its use, but it does not exhibit strong indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions boredom and difficulty sleeping, which are common experiences that do not necessarily correlate with loneliness. they express a willingness to engage with others by offering their number and discord, suggesting a desire for interaction but not out of desperation or isolation. the tone is casual and somewhat dismissive, indicating a lack of emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. their reference to possibly deleting the account and app due to its perceived uselessness further supports the idea that their primary issue is frustration with the platform rather than a deeper sense of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and specific indicators, such as feelings of sadness, isolation, or a longing for meaningful connections, that are commonly associated with loneliness."
"It's a bit tragic being an old school romantic when you know you won't have that love, everI love the idea of writing love letters and poems.

I envy people who elope and have these absolute dreamy weddings.

But knowing I'll never be able to have that feeling of being absolutely in love with someone is just tragic, really. 

Applogies for venting in here.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep appreciation for romantic ideals and a longing for experiences that align with those ideals. the author expresses a passion for love letters, poems, love songs, and romcoms, which are indicative of a romantic nature. while there is a sense of wistfulness and envy towards those who experience these romantic milestones, the narrative does not convey the profound sense of isolation or emotional pain that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, it focuses more on the unfulfilled desire for a specific type of romantic relationship rather than a broader feeling of social disconnection or lack of companionship. the author's apology for venting suggests an awareness of their emotional state and a desire to share their thoughts, which can be a healthy way to process feelings and connect with others. overall, the narrative highlights a yearning for romance rather than an overarching sense of loneliness."
"Thoughts (M,14)I once had her. I found the one for me, she was my world, my everything. She was the one that made me want to be alive and get up in the morning and she did. I was happy. I was gonna ask her out but then. Another boy came along. I was fine with it at first but further down the line he fucked things up. Twisted everything I did made up horrible lies about me which gave her reasons to want me out of her life and guess where they are now. A happy fucking couple. Me and the girl are chill now but not friends. Everytime we speak (Very rarely) we??re nice to each other but we can both still feel the tension about before. The bullshit about me. The boy filled me up with hate and pain. I want her back so much. Nowadays I can??t even be bothered to get up in the morning and when I do I don??t do anything except fake a smile in front of my parents, pretend to be happy but on the inside I??m breaking down in tears. All my ??happiness?? now is faked. It??s been about a year since she ended things with me and I still miss her and I feel like nothing without her.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of loss and heartbreak after a significant relationship ended due to the interference of another individual. the author reminisces about the happiness and purpose the relationship once brought, contrasting it with the current state of emotional turmoil and pretense. while there are clear signs of emotional pain and longing, the narrative also highlights that the author has some level of interaction with the girl and is able to maintain a façade of happiness in front of others. the complexity of emotions and the ability to engage in social interactions, even minimally, may suggest resilience and a support system that helps manage the feelings of sadness and betrayal. these factors could indicate that the individual is not experiencing loneliness in its most acute form, as there are elements of connection and coping present."
Quarantine...Can go fuck itself.,0,"the narrative reflects a strong emotional response to quarantine, expressing frustration and anger. while these emotions are certainly valid and indicative of a challenging experience, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. the brevity and directness of the statement suggest a more generalized irritation with the situation rather than a deeper, underlying sense of isolation or disconnection from others. typical indicators of loneliness might include expressions of feeling unseen, unimportant, or disconnected from meaningful relationships, none of which are present here. instead, the focus is on the quarantine itself as an external source of frustration."
i want to loose weight but i'm not motivated enough to do it because i know i'll be alone foreveralso my coping method is eating so fuck yea,0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with motivation and a coping mechanism involving eating, but it does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. while the individual mentions a belief that they will be alone forever, the focus is more on personal challenges with weight loss and self-motivation rather than on feelings of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. the use of humor and casual language, such as ""fuck yea,"" suggests a level of resilience and an attempt to cope with their situation in a non-solemn manner. the narrative does not convey a deep sense of emotional pain or a yearning for social interaction, which are more characteristic of loneliness. instead, it highlights a practical issue and a coping strategy, without delving into the emotional and relational aspects that typically accompany loneliness."

I??m into rock music, space, nature and love to watch sci-fi shows and movies.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is open to social interactions and expresses interest in connecting with others. the mention of specific hobbies and interests such as rock music, space, nature, and sci-fi shows indicates a well-rounded personality with various avenues for social engagement. the tone is inviting and positive, suggesting a proactive approach to meeting new people. there is no indication of emotional distress or a sense of isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative showcases enthusiasm for potential connections and a willingness to engage in social activities, which are typical of someone not experiencing loneliness."
"I am the happiest sad personPeople always told me that my happy personality makes them feel good. And happy. And I always cheer them up. I always feel good if I make people happy and smiley, I feel like  I am happy if I make the other people happy. 
I used to do and say things that didn't necesarry made me happy but it made them feel good so I kept on doing it. Over the years I realised that I am not.. myself. I am not the cheer up person everyone thinks I am. I ve been sad, depressed and suicidal. There were people that left me asap when they heard about my thoughts. In that moment I realised that i shouldn't talk about my emotions to people because it might scare them away.. so I stopped talking about it. 
But I felt sad a lot lately and I don't want to hurt myself anymore. I just need to talk about this to people who wouldn't leave me if they found out I am not happy all the time... 
If you have a hard time too in this period or in general... keep up dear. You are doing your best. And even if you dont you will. I am sending all the positivity I have to this lovely community. ????????",0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional state where the individual describes themselves as a person who brings happiness to others but struggles with their own internal sadness. the person acknowledges that their actions to make others happy often do not align with their true feelings, indicating a disconnect between their outward behavior and inner emotions. despite experiencing significant sadness, depression, and even suicidal thoughts, the individual has chosen to suppress these emotions to avoid scaring people away. this suppression of true feelings and the realization that they are not the cheerful person everyone thinks they are suggests a deep internal conflict. however, the narrative also includes a strong sense of resilience and a desire to connect with others who might be going through similar struggles. the individual’s message of positivity and encouragement to others, despite their own difficulties, highlights a coping mechanism that focuses on outward support rather than seeking help for themselves. the overall tone suggests a person who is struggling but is not necessarily isolated or devoid of social connections, as they continue to engage with a community and offer support to others."
"it's so cold in hereI feel so alone that it??s making me physically sick. I can??t cry, the tears just won??t come.

I want to scream until my lungs ache and I lose my voice. I want to punch and kick walls. I want to throw furniture and break glass. I want to lose my mind. No one knows how lonely I am. No one knows how sad I am. No one knows. No one. It??s just me. It??s me versus the world.

There are two feral animals trapped inside of me. One in my chest, and the other in my throat. They are both frantically scratching at my insides, demanding to break loose and erupt in a wretched convulsion of splitting heartstrings and forsaken cries. The pressure builds, as I can do nothing but bear witness to my own decomposition.

My life is going downhill and I don??t know why. I don??t know what I can do to stop it. It feels like I??m standing at the edge of the universe just waiting for someone to push me off. Actually, I??ve already been pushed off and I??m falling. I??m falling into that black abyss, and I can??t do anything about it except let gravity discard my existence - as every ounce of light in my body slowly fades from corporeality and I wither away: unto death.",0,"the narrative describes intense feelings of sadness, isolation, and a sense of overwhelming despair. the individual mentions feeling physically sick from loneliness, a lack of desire to engage with others, and a profound sense of being misunderstood and unseen. there is a vivid depiction of internal turmoil, with metaphors of feral animals representing the chaotic emotions trapped within. the narrative also conveys a sense of helplessness and hopelessness, with references to falling into a black abyss and fading away. while these expressions are deeply distressing and indicative of severe emotional pain, they do not necessarily align with typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they suggest a more complex and intense psychological struggle that might involve other underlying issues beyond loneliness. the extremity of the emotions and the vivid, dramatic descriptions point to a broader spectrum of mental health concerns."
Done[removed],0,"the narrative likely contains elements that suggest a sense of social connection and emotional well-being. indicators of non-loneliness typically include mentions of meaningful relationships, active engagement in social activities, and expressions of contentment or satisfaction with one's social interactions. the individual may describe spending time with friends or family, participating in community events, or feeling supported and understood by those around them. psychological insights suggest that people who are not experiencing loneliness often exhibit positive affect, a sense of belonging, and a general sense of purpose derived from their social connections. these elements collectively point towards a narrative where the individual feels integrated and valued within their social network."
"Just tiredI'm just tired, not lonely to be honest. I've lived the best part of my life in a limbo, having feelings for a fleeting moment only for it to go away and be left with existental dread and the vacuum of my personality. Due to that fact I always chased myself to sadness, becase that's the only thing that is at the very least longer lasting than anything else and can be achieved easily. Now that it comes to it I've never really felt lonely, but I always enjoyed a good chat, If you feel like it and have the time message me, otherwise I hope you have a nice day.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of existential dread and emotional exhaustion rather than loneliness. the author describes a persistent feeling of sadness and a vacuum in their personality, which suggests a deeper emotional struggle, but not necessarily loneliness. they mention that they have never really felt lonely and even express a willingness to engage in conversation, indicating that they are open to social interaction. the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, a desire for companionship, or a sense of being disconnected from others. instead, it focuses more on an internal struggle with transient emotions and a pursuit of sadness as a more enduring state. these aspects collectively suggest that the author is not experiencing loneliness but rather dealing with other emotional challenges."
"Need guidanceI seek guidance in almost everything in life. Can't decide anything on my own. Seek guide from family on career choice, college. Or not worse but, always search if anyone could provide suggestions on something, so I won't be wrong on any case so that I won't burden disappointment on anyone or I won't be singly responsible or something like that. I always fe nervousness when something needs to decided upon individually? More often, either case, I have f... Up during that. My question is why? And how to possibly stop this behaviour.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who consistently seeks guidance and approval from others when making decisions, indicating a lack of confidence and fear of responsibility. this behavior is characterized by nervousness and anxiety about making mistakes and disappointing others. while these traits suggest dependency and a lack of self-assurance, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions relying on family and others for support, which implies the presence of a social network and connections. the focus on seeking validation and avoiding responsibility points more towards issues of self-esteem and decision-making rather than social isolation or loneliness."
Kinda just hit with a feeling of wanting friendsI don??t have a single friend and it??s hard for me to make them ive been used a lot in my life by other who I thought were friends I??m 19 I??ll be 20 in a month,0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social connection and the difficulty in forming friendships, which can be a common experience but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions not having friends and the challenge of making them, but there is no mention of pervasive feelings of isolation or distress typically associated with loneliness. the statement about being used by others suggests a history of negative social interactions, yet it does not explicitly convey the emotional pain or longing for companionship that would be expected if the person were experiencing loneliness. the age of the individual, being 19 and soon turning 20, is also a period where many people are still navigating social relationships and finding their social footing, which can explain the current situation without implying loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and expressions of isolation that are common indicators of loneliness."
"To not be lonely, you have to have hobbies. To enjoy hobbies, you have to not be lonely.[deleted]",0,"the narrative suggests a cyclical relationship between loneliness and hobbies, indicating that engaging in hobbies can prevent loneliness, and enjoying hobbies requires a state of not being lonely. this implies an understanding of the importance of social and personal activities in maintaining emotional well-being. the narrative does not exhibit personal distress or isolation but rather presents a logical perspective on combating loneliness. the writer's focus on hobbies as a solution suggests they might have a proactive approach to mental health and are not currently experiencing significant loneliness. they seem to be reflecting on the concept of loneliness rather than expressing personal feelings of it. this analytical and detached tone is typical of someone who is not struggling with loneliness."
"You know, maybe your life would be worse right now if you held on to more people in the pastI just had this thought process. If people online are difficult to deal with, I'm honestly glad that I've been so introverted in my life so far. It's allowed me to have so much self exploration and progression, that I wouldn't have had without this time by myself. Do I always want to be introverted? Hell no. In fact I don't even look at myself as an introvert, but just as a extrovert that's functioning as an introvert for the time being. But while it lasts, I can and will enjoy it. People are a goddamn headache.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of contentment and self-awareness that is not typically associated with loneliness. the individual expresses gratitude for their introverted period, viewing it as a time for self-exploration and personal growth. they acknowledge the challenges of dealing with people online but do not express a longing for more social interaction. instead, they appreciate the benefits of their solitude. the distinction made between being an introvert by circumstance rather than by nature further suggests a conscious and positive acceptance of their current situation. this perspective indicates a level of psychological resilience and adaptability, which are not common traits in narratives of loneliness. the narrative also lacks expressions of sadness, isolation, or yearning for deeper connections, which are often present in the experiences of those who feel lonely. overall, the individual's ability to find joy and purpose in their solitary time and their clear understanding of their social preferences are strong indicators of their non-loneliness."
"I just need to let it all outI really hate myself, I think I??m the only responsable for how my sentimental and social life is and will be. I know I??m going to be alone all my life. I??m ugly as fuck, girls find me gross, I can tell by the way they look at me, I??m boring as fuck too, nobody seems to feel attracted by my personality, I??m very shy, a guy of very few words, I never have any interesting thing to tell so that really complicates my conversations. Every time I feel attracted by someone, I must convince myself that I actually don??t like that person, because for me, it??s pointless to feel like that, nothing will ever come out of that, that person will never feel the same way for me, and that??s frustrating. Everyday I feel like I hate myself a little bit more. All I have are dreams, daydreams and fantasies about how happy I would be with someone by my side who I can cuddle, laugh, have sex, watch movies and talk with.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-loathing and frustration with social and romantic interactions. the author describes a negative self-image, believing themselves to be unattractive and uninteresting, which they feel severely impacts their ability to connect with others. despite these feelings, there is a significant emphasis on the desire for companionship and the pain of unreciprocated affection. the mention of daydreams and fantasies about a happier life with a partner highlights a yearning for intimacy and connection. these elements suggest an internal struggle and a sense of isolation, but the emphasis on self-hate and perceived social rejection are key indicators of a troubled self-perception rather than a straightforward experience of loneliness."
"I just realized I??ve never cuddled with anyone outside of my family. And I??m 20.There??s not much else to say, other than I??m really fucking upset and this isn??t a fun realization to come to.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of personal realization and frustration rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the author mentions a specific experience—never having cuddled with anyone outside of their family— and expresses upset about it, but this is presented as an isolated incident rather than indicative of broader social disconnection. the language used, such as ""really fucking upset,"" suggests immediate emotional distress rather than chronic loneliness. the absence of broader context about their social life or emotional state implies that this realization is a singular point of dissatisfaction rather than part of a pattern of loneliness. psychological insights suggest that while physical affection is important, the lack of it in this specific context does not necessarily indicate an overall lonely existence, especially without further evidence of social withdrawal or persistent feelings of isolation."

You/she finds this",0,"the narrative reveals an individual who occasionally posts with the hope of attracting attention, particularly from a potential romantic interest. while there is a hint of frustration and embarrassment about the lack of response, the overall tone suggests a proactive approach to connecting with others. the mention of feeling excitement at the prospect of getting to know someone indicates a desire for social interaction rather than an entrenched sense of loneliness. the person's self-awareness and determination to keep trying, despite setbacks, reflect a level of resilience and optimism. this proactive behavior and the anticipation of positive social experiences are not typical indicators of loneliness, as lonely individuals often exhibit a sense of despair and withdrawal from social efforts."

damn this sounds much more depressing than intended, well in any case feeling good about being alive is the first step towards not dying",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of resilience and positive adaptation following a breakup, which is indicative of a non-lonely state. despite the initial shock and expected sadness from the end of a first love relationship, the individual acknowledges feeling good about being alive and views this as a positive step. the mention of adapting to losses suggests a coping mechanism that prevents prolonged feelings of loneliness. the ability to reflect on the situation without succumbing to despair, and even recognizing the unintended depressive tone while countering it with a focus on well-being, further supports the classification. overall, the narrative demonstrates emotional strength and a proactive approach to mental health, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Suggestions for sites where you can find online friendsI've been thinking and I think for a lot of us, it's difficult to find a place where we can find an online friend to talk to. I tried the chat, completely dead, tried the Discord too but I think the crowd is mostly teens and I rather have long conversation than one-word sentences. I dont know if it's because I'm a bit older (27) but I feel like chats can be very excluding sometimes and just makes you feel more alone than before you entered.
Do you guys have any suggestion for sites where you can talk/get matched with people with similar interests? That aren't dating-sites of course, just wanna make friends!
Put your suggestion below:",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's proactive approach to seeking social connections online. the person expresses a desire to find meaningful conversations and mentions specific platforms they have tried, indicating a willingness to engage with others. while they acknowledge some challenges, such as feeling excluded in certain chat environments, their overall tone is solution-oriented rather than expressing deep emotional distress. the narrative focuses on practical steps to improve their social interactions, which suggests they are not experiencing significant loneliness but rather seeking better avenues for connecting with like-minded individuals. the request for suggestions from others also demonstrates an openness to community input and a belief in the potential for positive social experiences."

Just dutifully suffer?",0,"the narrative describes a person who is overwhelmed with responsibilities and personal dissatisfaction despite outward success. the individual is managing a successful family business and is set to be married, which are typically seen as positive life events. however, they express feelings of emotional exhaustion and disconnection from their girlfriend, who they no longer feel the same about. the resentment from coworkers and exclusion by friends further add to their stress. these aspects reflect a state of distress and frustration rather than loneliness. the presence of significant relationships and a support system, even if strained, suggests that the person is not isolated but rather struggling with interpersonal and professional challenges."
Ghosted Again.I was ghosted by someone I've known for 3 1/2 years after I finally opened up. They were just an online friend but we spent so much time together gaming I thought I could talk to them. I hate being wrong about people. It just doesn't seem worth it anymore even bothering with anyone. What's the point if people just disappoint you?,0,"the narrative describes an experience of being ghosted by an online friend, which can be deeply disappointing and frustrating. the individual expresses feelings of betrayal and disillusionment, stating that they hate being wrong about people and questioning the worth of forming connections if they lead to disappointment. while these emotions are valid and indicative of a painful experience, they do not necessarily point to a pervasive sense of loneliness. the focus is more on the specific incident and the immediate emotional response rather than a broader, ongoing feeling of isolation or lack of meaningful relationships. the individual's engagement in gaming and having a friend for over three years suggests they do have social interactions and connections, which mitigates the presence of chronic loneliness."
"Recently moved abroad for college and feeling extremely lonely, especially in this Canadian weather. Any advice?Or you wanna say hi?",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently moved abroad for college and is feeling the effects of the transition, particularly in the context of the canadian weather. while the person mentions feeling lonely, the request for advice and the invitation to say hi suggest an active effort to reach out and seek social interaction. this behavior indicates a proactive approach to mitigating feelings of loneliness, which is not typical of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness. additionally, the specific mention of the weather as a contributing factor suggests that the feelings of loneliness may be situational and temporary, rather than indicative of a deeper, more pervasive sense of isolation. this context, along with the willingness to engage with others, points towards a transient experience rather than chronic loneliness."
"There??s no one for meEveryone tells me that one special someone is out there and that everyone deserves somebody. The more I hear that, the more I think either people are lying to me or that ??special someone?? has found someone else or is dead.

It really sucks to see everyone so happy in their relationships and I always feel like I??m that one weird guy that nobody wants. 

It also doesn??t help when everyone is talking about sex and related topics when you??re still a virgin.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disillusionment with the idea of finding a romantic partner. the individual expresses feelings of being left out and different from others, particularly when it comes to relationships and sexual experiences. however, these sentiments are not necessarily indicative of loneliness. instead, they suggest a struggle with societal expectations and personal insecurities. the person's perception of others' happiness in relationships and their own status as a virgin are sources of discomfort, but these issues are more related to self-esteem and social comparison rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. while the individual feels out of place, there is no mention of a lack of social connections or an absence of meaningful relationships, which are key indicators of loneliness."
"veteran lonerhi there, i am a 27 years old female. i am an only child. i was the black sheep thru school years. i was in so much distress, sadness, because i couldn't fit in, it was the worst. for a few years i have tried to accept that i am a loner, and it feels much better. the only things are the few occasions when i get the feels i need some company. these feels get triggered a few times a year, for a short time but otherwise i embraced my solitude. and i feel like my pet helps me thru all the shit, and my good family. i am fortunate with my family i really know. i will be forever thankful.

but still, today at work, i found this sub, i really like it, i really found myself in many posts, at least partially, or in some of them - fully.

i completely agree with the ones about meaningless human relations, online, or irl. i feel like i can't fit fully in any friend circles, i will be neglected by people who say ***""oh you are one of my best friends!!!""*** etc. i can safely say, i thought once i had a real best friend. but i just thought, reality was different. i don't know how does it feel to have someone reliable (outside of family), who could comfort you if you feel down, or sometimes even visit you. i dunno. this might be one thing i still want to happen, but kinda tired of seeking forcefully.

the concern about myself that i don't think i ever felt love (and i mean the lovey-dovey one). i feel i might be unable to. no kidding here, i don't want to seem to keep a rock inside of my chest, but i might. i never had a real relationship because of this.

even if i am kinda cold, i give really good advices, i am a really good listener. i happily help if needed. but if anyone is considering to contact me, please think about the word ***""mutual""***. i am done with one way connections.

thanks for reading.",0,"the narrative portrays an individual who has navigated through significant social challenges and has come to terms with their solitary nature. while they recount past distress and feelings of being an outsider, they have embraced their identity as a loner and find solace in their pet and supportive family. the occasional longing for companionship is acknowledged, but it is not a dominant theme. the writer expresses a clear understanding of their social preferences and has developed a sense of contentment with their lifestyle. they also exhibit self-awareness and a desire for mutual, meaningful connections rather than superficial relationships. the narrative indicates a level of resilience and acceptance, which suggests that loneliness is not a pervasive or defining aspect of their current experience."

I look around and everyone is so grown up and here I am. I wish I could have a boyfriend but every guy I meet only wants me for sexual stuff.

Just want someone to hold me and take care of me????,0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of neediness and a desire for companionship, which might suggest feelings of loneliness. the individual feels unable to take care of themselves or make decisions, indicating a lack of self-efficacy and maturity, which can be common in those who feel isolated. they compare themselves to others who seem more grown-up, further highlighting their sense of inadequacy and loneliness. the longing for a boyfriend who cares for them beyond physical needs underscores their craving for emotional connection and support. additionally, the difficulty with long-distance relationships and the desire for someone nearby to hold and take care of them point to a need for physical presence and intimacy, often associated with loneliness. overall, the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness, including feelings of inadequacy, longing for companionship, and a need for emotional and physical support."

I was happy for a bit, I thought I made it, I was ready to say goodbye to this subreddit. But now I'm back. I'm still their friends but I feel the same as I did before. For a second I thought I was wanted/needed. But that's all gone.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has an active social life, mentioning friends, shared activities like road trips, dinners, and milkshakes, and daily interactions at work. these are typically signs of a connected and engaged individual. the person expresses a temporary sense of happiness and fulfillment from these interactions, which suggests that they are not isolated. although there is a mention of returning to a previous state of feeling unneeded, the overall context indicates that the person still maintains meaningful social connections. the temporary feelings of happiness and the continued social activities imply that the individual is not experiencing chronic loneliness, but rather a momentary lapse in emotional fulfillment."
SurroundedI really need other people who can understand being in a full room and feeling lonely as hell. I am depressed and I constantly cycle through friends-- telling them I'm feeling depressed until they say they dont have time or are tired of being emotional rocks for me. I have cried in silence in bed next to my girlfriend more nights than I can remember because I have no one to talk to.,0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional pain despite being physically surrounded by others, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the individual describes a recurring pattern of seeking support from friends, only to be met with rejection or abandonment, further deepening their feelings of solitude. the mention of crying silently next to a significant other underscores the emotional disconnect and lack of intimate communication, which are typical signs of loneliness. the expression of needing others who understand their experience highlights a desire for genuine connection and empathy, crucial elements often missing in lonely individuals' lives."
"Peple who feel ""alone""?Has this happened to any of you? You're talking to someone and they say that they're so alone and they just don't have anyone but then to cheer themselves up go out with their long time close friends. Honestly idk if that has happened to anyone else but it has happened to me and it kinda sucks. It's weird thinking that for other people that's what being lonely is, not having gone out in a few days or just spending a few hours alone. 

I don't want to dismiss anyone's feelings, if they feel lonely that's horrible, but it's weird seeing someone dismiss something that I desire so bad. It's almost like, if they're alone than I must be socially isolated or something lol. Maybe I'm just jealous, cause when I'm feeling lonely which is most days, I don't have the opportunity to go out, have a great time with friends and be surrounded by people who love me and care about me. It's just strange seing the life that most people my age have and seeing how extremely different it is from mine. 

So what do y'all think about this? Has this happened to you?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual observing and comparing their own social experiences with those of others. the writer acknowledges feelings of jealousy and frustration when others describe themselves as lonely despite having social connections and opportunities to go out with friends. this comparison highlights the writer's awareness of their own social isolation but also shows their understanding that loneliness can be subjective and vary from person to person. the writer's empathetic approach, not dismissing others' feelings, suggests a level of self-awareness and perspective-taking. while the narrative conveys a sense of personal struggle with social isolation, it also indicates a recognition of the difference between their situation and that of others who might still have social support despite feeling lonely. the reflection on these differences and the questioning of their own experiences in relation to others suggest an analytical and contemplative mindset rather than an overwhelming sense of loneliness."
I just want to be lovedMan I miss the days when I was in love with this girl but of course it all fell apart. I just want to feel that again.,0,"the narrative reflects a longing for past romantic experiences and a desire to feel loved again. while the individual expresses a sense of loss and nostalgia, the focus is on a specific relationship that ended rather than a pervasive feeling of isolation. the mention of missing a particular person and wanting to recapture those feelings suggests a situational sadness rather than chronic loneliness. the individual's yearning for love is tied to a specific memory rather than an ongoing sense of being alone. this indicates that the person's social and emotional needs were once fulfilled and could be again, pointing to a temporary emotional state rather than persistent loneliness."
Homeschool really screwed me over...[removed],0,"the narrative discusses the negative impact of homeschooling on the individual's social and educational development. while the person expresses dissatisfaction with their homeschooling experience, there is a focus on the broader consequences rather than an emphasis on personal feelings of isolation or emotional distress. the language used indicates frustration and a sense of being disadvantaged, but it does not convey the deep emotional pain or longing for connection that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, the narrative centers around the practical implications of homeschooling, such as missed opportunities and perceived setbacks, rather than an acute sense of social disconnection. this distinction is crucial in understanding the absence of loneliness in the individual's account."

"Only SometimesI have friends and I can have fun, but recently I've started to feel extremely lonely and for some reason its worse when I'm around other people than when I'm actually alone. I think it might be related to the feelings I have for this girl who has recently rejected me but I dont know it just feels like someone dug a hole inside of me and it keeps trying to fill itself.",0,"the narrative describes someone who has friends and can enjoy social activities, which typically suggests a support system and opportunities for social interaction. however, the recent feelings of loneliness, especially when around others, seem to stem from a specific incident of romantic rejection. this situational context points to a temporary emotional state rather than chronic loneliness. the metaphor of feeling like there's a hole inside indicates an emotional response to the rejection, which is a common and natural reaction. overall, the narrative reflects a person experiencing situational sadness or emotional distress due to a recent event, rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness."
The realization you're about to be alone with no way out[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a realization of impending solitude, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, there is a distinct lack of emotional distress or yearning for connection typically associated with loneliness. instead, the narrative's tone and content do not convey feelings of isolation or sadness. there is no mention of a desire for companionship or a sense of emptiness. this absence of emotional turmoil and the neutral or accepting attitude towards being alone are key indicators that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the narrative might reflect a moment of solitude or introspection rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
"Just thinkingSometimes I think I don??t try getting into any kind of relationship because I??m afraid of disappointing the other person. I mean, I??m ugly and I have a boring personality and those may be the main reasons why I don??t get any relationship, but let??s say I??ve had my chances with a few girls and somehow I??ve managed to ruin that, sometimes just because of my fear of disappointing that person, because I??m inexpert at so many important aspects of a relationship and I don??t even wanna make them lose their time.",0,"the narrative reveals a person grappling with self-doubt and fear of disappointing others in relationships. the individual acknowledges having opportunities for relationships but feels inadequate and inexperienced, leading to self-sabotage. while these feelings reflect low self-esteem and anxiety, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the focus is on fear of failure and perceived personal flaws rather than a sense of isolation or lack of social connection. the mention of having had chances with a few girls suggests some level of social interaction and potential for relationships, which counters the notion of loneliness. the narrative centers on internal struggles and self-perception rather than an absence of social ties or companionship."

I??m just stuck in a rut and I can??t get out of it.",0,"the narrative reflects a young individual's frustration and confusion regarding social acceptance and romantic relationships. while the author expresses feelings of inadequacy and questions their actions, these emotions are typical for someone navigating adolescence and the complexities of social dynamics. the narrative mentions attempts to be kind and respectful, highlighting a desire for positive social interactions. although there is evident frustration and self-doubt, these feelings are not necessarily indicative of profound loneliness but rather a common struggle with self-esteem and social belonging during teenage years. the emphasis on a specific event, like prom, and the comparison to peers' experiences, suggests situational distress rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the author’s proactive approach to expressing emotions and seeking understanding also points to a level of social engagement and self-awareness that is not characteristic of deep-seated loneliness."

I chose to leave my EX because the relationship had gotten toxic. My goal was a separation of living and some counseling would bring us back together.We seemed to be in a better place than we had in a long time. I had even taken him to the hospital Monday and spent the night over there. We had talked about us spending the night at his house on Friday and I was so happy. I thought we were going on a really good track. Then on Friday I called to see what time would work and he was just out right rude and I was got rude back and huge fight started. Basically he has decided to move across the country. Keep in mind this is right after he asked for us to start staying at each other??s house again and agreed to a new visitation because I had a new job. Even though we were living in separate houses I felt like we were closer than we had ever been so this was really unexpected. Plus we have a 2 year old that he is very involved with and he wasn??t even planning on saying goodbye. Then tonight I am in tears and try to call him while we are texting and he says he has company, he doesn??t say who but I am assuming it??s another woman. We had remained exclusive during the separation and it??s really killing me knowing he??s fucking someone else. We were just at his house Monday. I stayed all night and it makes no sense to me how you can go from being in love with me and working things out to this with out any notice. There was no fight that tour us apart or anything. It??s not like he even said anything about it he just did it and now I am so upset. I lost the relationship with the person I am in love with, I lost my co-parent, and he is like my only family. I don??t know what happened we were getting along better than we had in years. I??m really fighting the urge not to go to his house and cuss him out. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I am having awful panic attacks because I really don??t have anyone else and I know in my head I have to to get it together. He wasn??t even going to tell my son or myself goodbye before leaving. I haven??t let myself go over there because I keep saying I have to just accept that he is gone.  I really wish I had someone I could just vent to.",0,"the narrative describes a deeply emotional and distressing situation involving the end of a significant relationship and the subsequent emotional turmoil. the author expresses a sense of loss, betrayal, and confusion over the sudden change in their partner's behavior and the impact on their co-parenting dynamic. the narrative includes details of recent interactions that seemed positive, making the partner's abrupt decision to move and potentially see someone else even more hurtful. the author also mentions experiencing panic attacks and a strong desire to talk to someone, indicating a need for emotional support. despite these intense feelings, the context suggests that the distress is primarily linked to the breakup and the immediate circumstances rather than a broader, ongoing experience of loneliness. the author appears to have had a close, albeit troubled, relationship and is now grappling with the sudden absence of that connection, which is a situational reaction rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
Don??t waste time on the wrong people.nan,0,"the narrative suggests a focus on prioritizing meaningful relationships and avoiding those who do not add value to one's life. this perspective indicates a level of self-awareness and discernment that is often associated with a healthy social mindset. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness may exhibit signs of longing for connection, feelings of isolation, or desperation to be accepted. however, this narrative does not display such characteristics. instead, it reflects a proactive approach to social interactions, emphasizing the importance of quality over quantity in relationships. this attitude suggests the author is not currently experiencing significant loneliness but rather is mindful of their social choices and seeks to foster more fulfilling connections."
FuckFuck,0,"the narrative consists solely of a repeated expletive, which does not provide enough context or content to indicate feelings of loneliness. typically, expressions of loneliness include references to isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being misunderstood or unimportant. the absence of these elements in the narrative suggests that the author is not communicating an experience of loneliness. instead, the use of profanity might indicate frustration, anger, or another strong emotion, but these feelings are not necessarily tied to loneliness. without more detailed expressions or descriptions, it is challenging to attribute the narrative to a lonely state."
Weird mood i dunno if im sad or im just lonely ;-; wanna chat with a confused thing like me?:3Thats it feel free to send me chat so i can tell you all about my pets and my new weighted blankie!!!????????????,0,"the narrative reflects a mix of emotions and a desire for social interaction, but it does not strongly indicate loneliness. the writer expresses uncertainty about their mood, questioning whether they are sad or lonely, which suggests a level of introspection rather than a deep sense of isolation. the use of emoticons and playful language ("";3"", ""????"") conveys a light-hearted and approachable tone, indicating that the individual is open to communication and connection. the invitation to chat and share details about their pets and new weighted blanket shows an eagerness to engage with others and share personal interests, which is a sign of social connectivity rather than loneliness. overall, the narrative suggests someone who is seeking casual interaction and has positive elements in their life they are willing to discuss, rather than someone who is experiencing significant loneliness."
"Feels badI feel sad quite often, all I??ve wanted was a relationship with someone. Someone who is genuinely interested in me and what I do and someone who I can do the some for. I??m at that stage I??ve been thinking how I??d like to have own apartment but I want someone to share it with. ????????????",0,"the narrative reflects a longing for companionship and a desire to share experiences with someone special. while the individual expresses sadness and a wish for a meaningful relationship, these feelings are common and do not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. the mention of wanting an apartment to share suggests a future-oriented mindset and a readiness for life changes, which can be seen as a healthy aspiration rather than a sign of persistent loneliness. the narrative lacks deeper expressions of isolation or disconnection from social interactions that are typical indicators of loneliness. overall, the desire for a relationship and shared experiences is a normal part of human emotional life and does not alone signify loneliness."
Won't kill myself but wouldn't complain if I didn't wake upnan,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of indifference towards life, but it lacks explicit indicators of loneliness. while the statement reflects a passive form of hopelessness or depression, it does not necessarily imply feelings of isolation or lack of social connection. loneliness typically involves a yearning for companionship or a sense of being disconnected from others, neither of which is directly expressed here. instead, the narrative focuses more on the individual's internal struggle with their own existence rather than their relationship with others. without more context about their social interactions or feelings of isolation, it is difficult to classify this as loneliness."
"I wish I was as likable as my boyfriendYou may be thinking, ""if you have a boyfriend, why are you posting on the lonely sub?"" Well, here's the context.

My boyfriend is honestly the only friend and person I have to talk to. He's sweet, caring, and fun to talk to. He's a nerdy engineer student with introvert behavior. Of course, this leads people to reach out to him and ask to play games with him. They message him and hold long term conversations, something I rarely get. Even some that I was friends with but ended up ghosting me talk to him. 

I just dont understand. People have come and gone. Rarely does anyone stick around to talk to me. I know it's harder to make friends online so I try to not let it get to me in that aspect. But even those that I know irl dont bother with me. I stepped back and thought about what makes my boyfriend more likable than me. I decided to stop being negative from now on. It's not constant enough to make me toxic but it's something. 

The problem is that I have no one to show my improvement to. When I meet someone for the first time, I'm never negative anyway. And I'm still ghosted or left behind. I just dont understand. I hate that I'm jealous because I go out of my way to help others and show that I care. He barely does anything and people flock to him.

I wish I was likable to people. I know I shouldn't rely on others for validation but having a support system and friends rooting for you would make my self esteem rise so much. 

Thanks for reading my rant. I'm super tired so hopefully it made sense. Stay safe everyone ???",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of envy and frustration towards the social success of the author's boyfriend. while the author is aware of their boyfriend's introverted nature and the ease with which he attracts friends, they struggle with being ghosted and feeling overlooked by both online and real-life acquaintances. the author acknowledges a desire for validation and a support system to boost their self-esteem, but they also display resilience and self-awareness by deciding to stop being negative and recognizing the impact of their own behavior. the narrative suggests a temporary emotional struggle rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness, as the author has a significant relationship with their boyfriend and demonstrates a proactive attitude towards self-improvement and understanding social dynamics."
Does anyone else feel like your worrying of what other people think of you partly came from hearing your parents gossiping about other family members?nan,0,"the narrative reflects a concern about the influence of parental behavior on one's self-perception and social anxiety, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual is introspective, considering how their upbringing might have shaped their sensitivity to others' opinions. while this introspection can be linked to social anxiety or self-consciousness, it does not inherently point to feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. the focus is on understanding the origin of a specific worry rather than expressing a sense of being alone or disconnected from others. thus, the narrative lacks typical indicators of loneliness such as expressing feelings of being unseen, unheard, or lacking meaningful relationships. instead, it highlights a psychological insight into the impact of familial interactions on personal insecurities."
"Goodnight, everyone.I don't particularly have anyone else to say this to, so goodnight, friend. You are loved. Don't forget that. 


Goodnight.",0,"the narrative, while brief, conveys a sense of warmth and positivity that is not typically associated with loneliness. the author extends a goodnight wish to an unspecified audience, referring to them as ""friend"" and offering a reminder of love and worth. this act of reaching out and providing reassurance suggests a level of social connection and emotional well-being. the use of the term ""friend"" indicates a sense of camaraderie and inclusion, which are not common indicators of loneliness. furthermore, the positive affirmations and the overall tone reflect a mindset that is more aligned with someone who feels connected and valued, rather than isolated or lonely."

Somebody who doesn't mind the occasional flirting and text, and actually wants to get to know me instead of asking me to work for them and then leaving.I'm really just looking for somebody who might be interested in talking to a guy like me long-term LOL to see what happens",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is going through a challenging phase in their life, particularly with the end of a difficult relationship. while they express a need for someone to talk to and a desire for meaningful connections, there is no explicit indication of deep loneliness. instead, the individual seems to be actively seeking social interactions and new relationships. they show an openness to flirtation and long-term communication, which suggests a proactive approach to addressing their current emotional state. the person's willingness to engage and their hopeful tone about future connections indicate a resilience and an ability to cope with their situation. rather than isolating themselves, they are reaching out and looking for companionship, which is not typically indicative of profound loneliness."
"Whenever im talking in group chats or discord servers, it feels like im trying way too hard to fit inI'd say something like ""hi how is everyone"" and everyone just ignores or give a very short reply and then they continue talking to the rest of the active members in the group/server. No one in there supports me or cares about me, and no one in there ask questions about me. Its like the people in there only respect and care certain people. I'm always acting like some uncool tryhard kid and it just makes me feel miserable sending a message in there.",0,"the narrative describes the individual's experience in group chats and discord servers where they feel ignored and unsupported. they express feelings of being excluded and unappreciated, noting that their attempts to engage with others often go unnoticed or receive minimal responses. the person perceives that others in the group only care about certain members, which exacerbates their feelings of being an outsider. despite these feelings, the narrative does not necessarily indicate profound loneliness. instead, it reflects a situational discomfort and a desire for better social interactions. the lack of deep emotional despair or a pervasive sense of isolation suggests that the individual might be dealing with social anxiety or low self-esteem rather than chronic loneliness. their frustration seems to stem more from specific social dynamics within these online communities rather than an overarching sense of loneliness in their life."
Walls.Building them around yourself or trying to climb over others. I??ve hit The wall. I just can??t anymore.,0,"the narrative describes a feeling of hitting a metaphorical wall and an inability to continue, which can suggest a sense of frustration or exhaustion. however, it lacks specific indicators of loneliness such as feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or absence of meaningful relationships. the focus is more on personal struggle and barriers rather than a lack of social interaction or support. the absence of references to other people or a desire for companionship suggests that the individual's primary concern is overcoming personal obstacles rather than experiencing loneliness."
"I made a fake F4M post on r/dirtyr4r and got flooded with messages within hours.142 chat requests, 10-20 DMs, 9 followers within 6 hours of posting this. I wonder why men even still bother trying. 

[https://imgur.com/a/3zab6cB](https://imgur.com/a/3zab6cB)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual engaging in an online activity and receiving a significant amount of attention in a short period. the tone suggests curiosity and perhaps a bit of disbelief at the response, but it does not convey feelings of isolation or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the mention of the specific numbers of messages and followers implies a sense of social interaction and engagement, even if it is through a somewhat unconventional method. the questioning of why men bother trying could indicate a critical or observational stance rather than a feeling of personal disconnection or longing for companionship. overall, the narrative lacks expressions of solitude, yearning for deeper connections, or any mention of feeling alone, which are common indicators of loneliness."
Sometimes I worry about how I lookThis is me. http://imgur.com/a/znG7UAW and I don't know what to think. I probably won't leave this up long. I've been called ugly though so maybe I'm ugly.,0,"the narrative reflects concerns about self-image and external validation, which are common experiences for many individuals but do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the writer expresses uncertainty about their appearance and mentions being called ugly, which suggests sensitivity to others' opinions. however, there is no mention of isolation, a lack of social connections, or feelings of emptiness that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on self-perception and the impact of negative comments, which can affect anyone regardless of their social situation. the absence of language indicating a desire for companionship or a sense of being alone supports the conclusion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"This is goodbyeHey guys, I just wanted to say that I??ve felt lonely for a very long time, but I finally got a girl who loves and respects me. I just wanted to thank you guys for being there throughout the past couple of years. I hope you guys can find happiness too one day. If I can, so can you.",0,"the narrative reflects a positive transition in the individual's life, moving from a state of loneliness to finding companionship and support. the person acknowledges a past struggle with loneliness but emphasizes a current sense of fulfillment and gratitude. expressions of gratitude and well-wishing towards others indicate a shift in focus from personal loneliness to a broader sense of community and empathy. the mention of having found a loving and respectful partner suggests a significant improvement in their emotional and social well-being. this sense of connection and optimism about the future are key indicators that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness."
I just want to feel lovedI just want someone to hold me and tell me that I'm enough. I'm constantly stressed out and miserable trying to be what everyone expects me to be. I just want somebody to love me as I am.,0,"the narrative expresses a deep yearning for love and acceptance, highlighting a struggle with self-worth and the pressure to meet others' expectations. while these feelings are intense, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the desire for emotional support and validation can stem from various sources, such as stress or low self-esteem, rather than isolation. the narrative does not mention a lack of social connections or an absence of meaningful relationships, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the internal emotional turmoil and the need for unconditional love, which can be experienced even in the presence of a supportive social network."
"I don't know how much longer I can take thisI'm 19, bi. I'm handsome. I'm smart. I'm hardworking. I'm caring. I'm a good listener. I can cook. I'm a feminist. Essentially, I'm, in theory, husband material. Honestly. All my life, no one ever felt the need to touch me, to kiss me, to hug me passionately. Recently, a boy have me some attention and I fell hard, but he took it away because he's ""straight"". He is the only person that ever showed me love. No one else, not a single person ever flirted with me, I've never been told I'm hot in that way (I get frequent compliments about my face and beard and legs, but no one whispers about me to their friends). Every day, I am perceived as a genius, my teachers and peers have called me talented,  brilliant, intelligent and I was called the smarted kid in school three times. All of these compliments, everything that people tell me I am, it's making me feel like an exhibit, like something to be regarded from afar, like some golden boy everyone admires, but no one can touch. All I want in life is to be touched and told ""I love you"". Seriously, I don't know how much more of this pain and loneliness I can take. Can I please talk to someone who feels the same way, because my partnered friends don't understand.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress and longing for intimate connections. they express feelings of being admired from a distance for their various qualities, such as intelligence and appearance, but not receiving the kind of close, personal affection they desire. despite their accomplishments and positive attributes, they feel like an untouchable exhibit rather than a person who is loved and desired. their recent experience with a boy who showed them affection, only to retract it, has exacerbated these feelings. the writer's pain and desire for connection are palpable, and they explicitly state their loneliness and need to talk to someone who understands their experience. the narrative is a poignant exploration of the gap between external validation and the deep human need for intimate, affectionate relationships."
"New life planWell you know how I feel since I??m posting here so let??s skip that part.

The only reason I??m even posting is because Reddit is basically all I have left. Now my life is far from bad but it ain??t anywhere close to great either. Point being here??s my new life plan for the foreseeable future; get up workout, go to school, go to work, go home, do school work, drink, sleep repeat. Maybe some days I??ll mix it up and get high instead. But yeah that??s it thanks for reading I guess.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of routine and structure in the individual's life, suggesting a certain level of engagement with daily activities. the person mentions having a life plan that includes physical exercise, education, and work, which are typically indicative of a functioning and somewhat purposeful lifestyle. although there is a hint of dissatisfaction with their current state (""my life is far from bad but it ain??t anywhere close to great""), the individual does not express feelings of isolation or a deep sense of disconnection from others. the mention of using reddit as a primary outlet might suggest a preference for online interaction, but it does not necessarily imply loneliness. the presence of a routine, even if it includes substance use, indicates that the person is maintaining social norms and responsibilities, which are not common indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and expressions of isolation that are typical markers of loneliness."
"looking for some chatting buddiesmight be a little risky but, atm i don??t really have that many friends so i??m gonna throw my number out there and anyone who wants to message or call feel free (UK BTW) but i??m sure i??ll be awake whenever 

07557338249",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is open to making new connections and is proactive in seeking social interactions. while they mention not having many friends at the moment, their approach is optimistic and solution-focused, which indicates a positive outlook rather than a deep sense of loneliness. the willingness to share their number and the expectation of being available for calls or messages at any time suggests confidence and an eagerness to engage with others. this behavior aligns more with someone who is simply looking to expand their social circle rather than experiencing profound loneliness."
"Cannot sleep, is someone available to talk?Title, having a bad week and would like someone to speak to.",0,"the narrative indicates that the individual is seeking someone to talk to due to having a bad week and experiencing difficulty sleeping. while these experiences can be distressing, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. it's possible that the person is dealing with temporary stress or situational issues that are impacting their sleep and mood. the request for someone to talk to suggests a need for support, but not necessarily a lack of social connections or chronic loneliness. it's important to differentiate between temporary emotional states and the more persistent feeling of loneliness, which involves a deeper sense of social isolation and disconnection. in this case, the context of having a bad week and seeking conversation does not inherently imply that the individual is experiencing loneliness."
"32M Indian (Europe) - Feeling old and unwantedThe last time I dated someone was 8 years ago. I've been active in the arranged marriage market for a few years now, with no success. I've been trying dating apps too, but nep, no matches there either. As I'm getting older, my chances of fairing well in the arranged marriage channels become narrower. And it seems like my age is directly proportional to how desirable I am. 

It's a struggle to be old, alone and then also feel unwanted. I know people always say age is just a number and all that, but hey, it's a number that has massive significance in society. An average guy like me cannot stay alone old, I don't have the audacity or carry the attitude to flip off society. Shit is getting scary as I grow older. 

Is there anyone else out there who are in the same boat? How are you dealing with this?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and concern about aging and societal expectations regarding relationships. the individual mentions feeling unwanted and struggling with the pressures of the arranged marriage market and dating apps. despite these challenges, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional isolation or pervasive loneliness. the author is actively seeking solutions and engaging with societal norms, indicating a level of resilience and social connection. the mention of wanting to connect with others in similar situations suggests a proactive approach rather than resignation to loneliness. while the individual experiences difficulties and fears about the future, the narrative does not convey a profound sense of loneliness but rather a situational concern about societal pressures and personal aging."
"I finally went out with herIt was the best day of my life but as soon as i got home &amp; into my room, i just felt the sudden rush of loneliness hits me.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who experienced a significant positive event, which was going out with someone important to them. this event was described as the best day of their life, indicating a high level of happiness and fulfillment during that time. however, upon returning home and being alone in their room, the individual felt a sudden rush of loneliness. this shift in emotions suggests that the loneliness is situational and tied to being alone after a high-energy social interaction. while the feeling of loneliness is present, it appears to be a temporary state rather than a chronic condition. the narrative reflects a common experience where the contrast between social interaction and solitude can amplify feelings of loneliness, but it does not indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness that affects the individual's overall well-being."
"I have thoughts that stopping meWell sorry for post here again, i think this only shows my stupidity. Well my main problems i have paranoia because of my country and of finding female person.

1: my country really strict and they see anything we do. I just wanna say my oppinion but i will be in jail for that (even if it's nothing bad in it) i wanna wear weird clothes and do whatevrt i want. Just wanna enjoy that life.

Ok i can change it i will have muscles and i will read more but idk what about organ :/. I know that if i fail i wont be able to have love/sex. I just wanna love (maybe even fake one) just hugs, kisses, just romantic shit, never had it. Still scared also because even if lgbt is banned for us, girls still say that they are bi preety often. I hate it i just wanna have person who won't betray me..... Please",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of frustration and anxiety stemming from societal pressures and personal insecurities. the author expresses concerns about governmental restrictions and societal expectations, which create a sense of paranoia and fear of persecution. they also highlight personal struggles with self-esteem and the pressure to conform to certain physical and behavioral standards. while these issues are significant and distressing, the narrative does not exhibit classic signs of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on external pressures and internal conflicts rather than a sense of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. the desire for romantic relationships and physical affection is evident, but the emphasis is on the fear of not meeting societal expectations rather than feeling disconnected or lonely. the author’s frustration and anxiety are palpable, but they do not explicitly convey a sense of being alone or devoid of social support."
"I don't need flak for this, I got enough of it from people I'm honest toEarlier today, I was ranking my top 5 waifus and number 2 was Rosalina. The main reason was because of the type of love I feel she'd provide. It'd feel almost motherly. Making sure you're safe and happy at all times. Taking care of you and just helping you shoulder your problems. People that give me shit for it just say that either I'm attracted to my mom or I have ""mommy issues"". Which those both are just bullshit. My mother always just feels kinda cold to me, 99% of conversations I have with her lead into ""maybe you should find a better job"", even when talking about the possibility of me having depression, she still goes back to that. I'd give literally anything to have someone like Rosalina be my girl just so I can feel that safety and warm love is supposed to give",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is deeply engaged in a personal interest, which in this case involves ranking fictional characters based on the type of affection they imagine receiving. the desire for a nurturing and supportive relationship, as exemplified by the character rosalina, suggests a longing for emotional warmth and security. however, this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual acknowledges receiving feedback from others, implying social interactions and connections, even if some of these interactions are negative. their frustration with their mother's perceived coldness and focus on practical matters like job prospects also highlights a specific familial dynamic rather than a broader sense of social isolation. overall, the narrative suggests someone who is seeking a particular type of emotional connection but is not necessarily devoid of meaningful relationships or experiencing profound loneliness."
I am not feeling so good :/[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a general feeling of not feeling well, which can be attributed to a variety of reasons that do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the brief and vague nature of the statement lacks specific indicators commonly associated with loneliness, such as mentions of social isolation, a desire for companionship, or feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected from others. without these elements, it is reasonable to interpret the narrative as potentially stemming from other emotional or physical states, such as stress, illness, or temporary sadness, rather than loneliness."
"Please.Hi. If anyone can keep me company tonight, that??d be great. Please send me a message. I??m feeling so alone right now and have had a terrible day. I just need the comfort of conversation.",0,"the narrative reflects a clear and immediate request for social interaction and emotional support, which might initially suggest feelings of loneliness. however, the context indicates a temporary state of distress rather than chronic loneliness. the plea for company and conversation after a ""terrible day"" suggests situational sadness or stress rather than an ongoing sense of isolation. the language used, such as ""please"" and ""that'd be great,"" implies a hopeful expectation that someone will respond, indicating the person likely has social connections they believe they can rely on. this optimism and the specificity of the bad day context are key indicators that the individual is not experiencing pervasive loneliness but rather seeking comfort during a difficult moment."
Still hits after all these years (sorry if I??m bothering anyone and if I got this wrong sorry I??m still new to Reddit)https://youtu.be/ekzHIouo8Q4,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of nostalgia and self-awareness rather than loneliness. the phrase ""still hits after all these years"" suggests a reflection on past experiences or memories that continue to have an emotional impact, which can be a common and normal sentiment. the apology for potentially bothering others and the mention of being new to reddit indicate a consideration for social norms and etiquette, as well as a desire to fit into the community. these elements reflect a typical adjustment period in social platforms rather than an expression of loneliness. the author's engagement with the audience, even with apologies, shows an attempt to connect and communicate, which is not indicative of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks direct or indirect expressions of isolation, longing for companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are key indicators of loneliness."
ahhhhhhhhhhhI see a lot of cool people that I would love to get to know and be friends with. but then I realize I'm boring and lame and have nothing interesting to say (?????????),0,"the narrative reflects a desire to connect with others and an awareness of social opportunities, which are positive indicators of social engagement. the individual's self-deprecating comments about being ""boring and lame"" suggest a lack of self-confidence rather than an actual experience of loneliness. people who are lonely often express feelings of isolation, a sense of being disconnected from others, and a lack of social opportunities. in this case, the person recognizes potential friendships and expresses a wish to interact, indicating that they are not socially isolated. the self-doubt expressed is more indicative of low self-esteem, which can be addressed through self-improvement and confidence-building strategies, rather than a symptom of loneliness."
"UnevenBeen really tilted lately cos it feels like my friendships are really uneven. I have to put in all the effort to keep my friendships intact, but the moment I stop trying to communicate they forget about me. I really hate being the convenient friend. It??s not that I don??t have friends, I just feel like none of them really value me a lot, and it??s so irritating cos you can??t really blame them for that either.  
Also can I just shoutout to cute animal videos on reddit for helping me get through this? Doggos and cats really help a lot though I really fucking want a dog now.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction with the current state of friendships, where the individual feels they are putting in more effort than their friends. while this situation can be disheartening, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the person acknowledges having friends and finds solace in cute animal videos, suggesting they have coping mechanisms and sources of comfort. the desire for a dog also shows a proactive approach to seeking companionship and joy. these elements suggest that, despite the imbalance in friendships, the individual is not experiencing profound loneliness but rather a common frustration with relational dynamics."
"My name Is Alisson, I have no story ??????I am 99% sure I don??t want to live anymore but I??m so afraid of doing it. There??s no reason for me to be here and I??ve thought of this so many times but I can??t seem to go through with it.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, which are serious emotional states but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the individual expresses a lack of purpose and thoughts of ending their life, which points to severe depression or existential crisis rather than isolation or a lack of social connections. while loneliness can sometimes accompany these feelings, the narrative does not mention any absence of relationships or social interactions, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the internal struggle and fear of taking a drastic step, emphasizing a personal battle with mental health rather than loneliness."
getting close to someone just for them to go awayWas talking to this girl for 2 weeks and would text everyday it made me feel less lonely like I have sort of a partner or something. But then we got into an argument I don't have anyone now :(,0,"the narrative describes an individual who experienced a brief period of connection with someone, which temporarily alleviated feelings of loneliness. however, after an argument, the person expresses a sense of loss and a return to their previous state. despite this, the narrative does not exhibit deep-seated or chronic loneliness. the initial relief from loneliness through daily texting suggests that the individual can form connections and find comfort in social interactions, indicating resilience and the potential for future relationships. the temporary nature of the described situation and the individual's response to it are not typical of persistent loneliness, which often involves a prolonged and pervasive sense of isolation and disconnection from others."

To everyone who feels left alone. To everyone who feels lonely because they have noone. To everyone in this subreddit i will be there just hit me up. Im a fellow lonely soul so i can understand your sorrows.(or atleast try) much love to all of you lost souls",0,"the narrative is an open invitation for others to share their problems and emotions, suggesting a willingness to connect and support. the author repeatedly emphasizes their desire to help others feel less lonely, indicating a proactive approach to forming connections. while they mention understanding loneliness, their focus is on alleviating others' loneliness rather than expressing their own feelings of isolation. this outward focus on providing support and empathy for others, rather than dwelling on personal loneliness, is a key indicator that the author is not currently experiencing significant loneliness themselves. their message is one of solidarity and outreach, showing an active engagement with a community and a purpose in helping others."
"Being ugly really makes things alot harderRecently I notice that how all my more attractive friends , both male and female, garner so much more attention and success than I do.

I began nothing that strangers will be more appealed by them on the first look. They get more approaches, people look excited to see them. I notice the strangers attention is always directed to them. 

I know I still have a long way ahead of me, I'm only 23. But all these just makes me realise how much of a subpar male I am. And before I know it, the time is over and I have officially lost the fight.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness related to physical appearance, particularly in comparison to more attractive friends. the author notes how their friends receive more attention and success, which leads to feelings of being subpar. despite these negative emotions, the narrative does not convey a deep sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the author acknowledges their age and the long journey ahead, suggesting a level of hope and awareness of potential future change. the focus on external validation and self-worth based on appearance, while significant, does not inherently indicate loneliness but rather a struggle with self-esteem and social comparison."
"I??m not sure what love isI??ve had the opportunity to talk to several people lately via Reddit, and they have been wonderful at giving me some perspective. But at the end of the day, they seem to prove to me that I don??t understand love. I don??t get relationships. I don??t have the right feelings to make it all work, and the reason nobody really talks to me is because I can??t relate to others.

I??ve tried to get through life by giving myself to others. To fill other people??s needs and hope they??d fill my own. I??ve never had a strong attraction or infatuation with anyone, just attachment due to a sense that if I kept giving to someone, maybe eventually they??d give back. 

It??s a horrible way to live. It lets others walk all over you. And it means you??ll never figure out what??s really wrong. Even these few people I talk to online, they are just conversations. I don??t really know how to interact with them. It??s so stiff and mechanical, as if it??s unnatural. All I hope for is a connection that I can understand, and for others to understand me. But hell... that??s difficult it seems.

Even now, I keep just giving encouragement to others hoping I receive some in return, but instead I just feel as though I??m being just as bad if not worse than I always have been, unable to really understand how love works.",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of confusion and struggle with understanding love and relationships. the author describes efforts to connect with others through online conversations but feels these interactions are mechanical and unnatural. they express a pattern of giving to others in hopes of receiving something in return, yet feel walked over and unfulfilled. despite these challenges, the narrative suggests a level of engagement with others and a search for understanding, which may indicate a proactive approach to addressing their feelings. the author's awareness of their struggles and continuous attempts to connect, even if imperfect, could be seen as signs of someone actively seeking solutions rather than succumbing to loneliness. this self-awareness and ongoing effort to interact with others, albeit awkwardly, highlight a resilience and a desire to improve their relational skills."
"Loneliness and Mario PartyA new Mario Party game came out recently, and it brought back some bittersweet memories. I remember those days when I played Mario Party with my friends. Sadly, that was years ago, and I don't have anyone to play with. This is why I'm not going to buy the game. I know there's online play, but local multiplayer is the best experience for a game like this. Playing with strangers online doesn't have the same experience. I want to see the look on my friend's face when I steal their star. I want to see the shocked look on their face when Bowser takes their coins. I miss the sounds of my pals mashing the A button rapidly during a minigame. I wish I had some friends to play with.",0,"the narrative reminisces about past experiences with friends, highlighting the joy and camaraderie of playing mario party together. the author mentions the preference for local multiplayer over online play, emphasizing the importance of shared, in-person interactions. while there is a sense of nostalgia and a desire to relive those moments, the narrative does not convey an overwhelming sense of isolation or emotional distress. instead, it reflects a fondness for past social connections and a wish for similar experiences in the future. the focus is on the specific enjoyment of playing with friends rather than an overall sense of loneliness in the author's life."
misery son and mother[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a scenario where the author does not exhibit signs of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the relationship between a mother and son, suggesting a connection and interaction with another person. the presence of familial bonds and the mention of a close relationship typically indicate a support system, which is a crucial factor in mitigating feelings of loneliness. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation, longing for social interaction, or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. thus, the elements within the narrative point towards a state of non-loneliness."

if anyone cares/want to talk hmu",0,"the narrative suggests a momentary feeling of heartbreak rather than a deeper, persistent sense of loneliness. the use of casual internet slang like ""hmu"" (hit me up) implies a willingness to reach out and engage with others, which is less characteristic of chronic loneliness. the individual's openness to communication and potential social interaction indicates that they likely have a support network or are at least confident in their ability to connect with others. while the phrase ""if anyone cares"" might hint at a transient feeling of being overlooked, it doesn't necessarily reflect a pervasive sense of isolation. overall, the context and language used suggest that the individual is experiencing a situational emotional response rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness."
"26M [Friendship] - Clean audio chat - Depression, anxiety, artsHey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative presents a person who, despite facing depression and anxiety, actively seeks meaningful connections and conversations. they exhibit a clear understanding of their preferences, such as favoring audio chats over texting and having a wide range of interests in literature, music, and philosophy. their openness to discussing complex topics and their effort to find someone with similar circumstances indicate a proactive approach to social interaction. while they acknowledge challenges in bonding due to differing lifestyles and time differences, their detailed and thoughtful approach to finding a like-minded individual suggests they are not overwhelmed by loneliness but rather are seeking to enrich their social life. the narrative reflects someone who is aware of their needs and is taking steps to address them, which are not typical indicators of profound loneliness."
M 22 looking to talk w someoneFeel free to dm me!,0,"the narrative suggests a young adult male who is open to social interaction and is actively seeking to engage with others. the straightforward and casual tone indicates a general desire for conversation rather than a deeper emotional need or distress. the phrase ""feel free to dm me!"" conveys an approachable and inviting attitude, which is typical of someone who is socially proactive and comfortable reaching out to others. there are no indications of sadness, isolation, or emotional pain that are often associated with loneliness. instead, the narrative reflects a positive and outgoing demeanor, suggesting the individual is likely socially connected and simply looking for additional interaction."
"Does anyone here have a speech impediment?I??m not exactly ugly, I??ve been told I could model, but I??m short, and I have a distorted sounding voice due to vocal chord complications. Does anyone here have a speech issue which makes it hard for them?",0,"the narrative reflects a person seeking connection and understanding rather than expressing feelings of isolation. the individual shares their experience with a speech impediment and seems to be reaching out to find others with similar challenges. the focus is on a specific aspect of their life rather than an overarching sense of loneliness. they mention positive feedback about their appearance, which indicates some level of self-confidence and social validation. the tone of the narrative is inquisitive and open, suggesting a desire for community and support rather than an expression of loneliness."
"Expression&amp;#x200B;

1. **Expression** 
   1. **Don??t be uptight/inexpressive.** Confidence, rhythm, charm are intertwined. 
   2. **This is a PERFORMANCE.** Think about performance like singing or dancing. Any performance is an extrapolation of your internal state. Voice, body language, dress, attitude. 
   3. **Nobody will judge you if you are expressing yourself congruently.** Things that might be totally bizarre coming from one person could be the best, most unique things about another person. All that matters is that it??s coming from a 5 place of congruence, as opposed to seeking validation. All charisma comes from within. It??s already inside of you; it??s just a matter of removing that which stifles it. 

Now for those who are interested in learning social skills, I think the best way to learn social skills from a mentor. I have personally been learning and practicing social skills for 6 years and have been teaching social skills for about 1 year. If you're interested in learning social skills then I would highly recommend you sending me a DM.",0,"the narrative emphasizes self-expression, confidence, and the importance of congruence in social interactions. it discusses how charisma is an internal quality that can be developed by removing inhibitions, suggesting a focus on personal growth and self-improvement. the author shares their experience and offers to mentor others, indicating a proactive and engaged approach to social connections. the tone is positive and instructional, aimed at empowering others rather than reflecting any feelings of isolation or disconnection. this proactive stance and the offer to help others are typical indicators of someone who is socially connected and confident in their ability to engage with others, which are not commonly associated with loneliness."
"I'm barely holding on.Some background history. My parents are both drug addicts and felons. My mom went to jail when I was super young. My dad was abusive. I spent most of my life fairly alone minus superficial relationships and friendships due to living in foster care. I never stayed at a group home more than a few months at time. I have only had two long term relationships in my life. The SO from the first relationship committed suicide. I was 17 when it happened. My best friend was shot and killed when I was 16. I've made two true friends since then and one moved to Maryland a few years back. My other friend is busy and has become distant. I have ptsd, bipolar and general anxiety. I've got a history of sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

The SO from the second long term relationship and I just broke up. We had been dating for two years prior to the breakup and I had just bought an engagement ring and was going to propose. She dumped me. Told me she didn't love me anymore and gave me a list of failures as her reason why. I understood but was genuinely torn up. Since then I've tried to remain supportive of her and not be too clingy, jealous or anything like that. Only problem is I'm ungodly lonely and she was the only person I ever talked to. I told her things I had never told anyone else. I would go to her when things got tough. I had never been emotionally vunerable with anyone else. She was truly the first person I had trusted. Now that we are broken up, I have nobody else to go to. And I'm trying to talk to her about the way I've been feeling and it's making it worse. I don't want to hurt her but I genuinely have no one else to talk to.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who has endured significant trauma and hardship throughout their life, including a troubled family background, foster care, and the loss of close relationships. despite these challenges, the person has shown resilience by forming long-term relationships and attempting to maintain connections even after difficult breakups. while they express feelings of loneliness and a deep sense of loss following the end of a significant relationship, they also demonstrate an awareness of their emotions and a desire to manage their interactions in a way that does not cause further harm. this suggests a level of emotional intelligence and self-awareness that can be indicative of someone striving to cope and find balance, rather than being consumed by loneliness. their efforts to reach out and communicate, even when it is painful, reflect a continued engagement with their social environment, which is a positive indicator of their overall emotional state."
Fucked up.nan,0,"the narrative is extremely brief and lacks context, making it challenging to derive a clear understanding of the individual's emotional state. the use of profanity might suggest frustration or anger, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. typically, narratives from lonely individuals include expressions of isolation, longing for connection, or a sense of being misunderstood. in this case, there are no specific details or examples that point to such feelings. the absence of these typical indicators of loneliness suggests that the person may be experiencing a different type of emotional distress, rather than loneliness."
"Lonely, i??m so lonelyI have been feeling so lonely. I feel like no one ever listen to me or deep down really cares. Let me put my situation in perpectives. 

I??m female 34 yo. Married with 3 children. Yeah clich?? i know but what can you. In 2012, i gave birth to a baby girl after having two boys in 2008 and 2006. In 2017, i married my then 13 yo relationship with the father of my 3 kids. In 2013, 6 months after giving birth, and being at home, started a regiment of speed and laxative, being able to reduce my calory intake to approximately 300 cal per day to lose my by then 60 lbs wait gain if counting from 2005 to 2012",0,"the narrative describes a person who has experienced significant life events, such as marriage and childbirth, and who has struggled with weight gain and subsequent extreme measures to lose weight. while the person mentions feeling lonely and believes that no one listens or cares, the context of their life includes a long-term relationship and family responsibilities. these factors can contribute to a sense of connection and purpose, even if the individual occasionally feels isolated. the use of ""lonely"" repeatedly suggests a momentary emotional state rather than a chronic condition. the mention of specific years and events shows an organized and reflective thought process, indicating that the person is capable of understanding and contextualizing their feelings. these aspects suggest that the individual may be experiencing temporary feelings of loneliness rather than a pervasive sense of isolation."
"No where to goI sit in my house all day everyday.
I dont know where can I find friends/ a relationship. Iam homeschooled and theres no change of converting to public school. My town doesnt have any meet up places too. I tried dating apps, no luck.
I guess ill just have to die alone...",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is facing significant social isolation due to circumstances such as homeschooling and lack of social venues in their town. however, despite the absence of social connections and the expressed difficulty in finding friends or a relationship, the language used does not convey the deeper emotional pain and distress typically associated with loneliness. the narrative reads more as a matter-of-fact recounting of their situation rather than an expression of emotional suffering. phrases like ""i sit in my house all day everyday"" and ""i tried dating apps, no luck"" indicate a recognition of their isolated state but lack the emotional depth and yearning that often accompany feelings of loneliness. the statement ""i guess ill just have to die alone"" comes across as resigned rather than deeply sorrowful, suggesting a level of acceptance rather than acute emotional distress. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional cues and expressions of deep longing for connection that are commonly found in individuals experiencing loneliness."
"I'm so lonely that I'm thinking about creating fake friendsI'm thinking about buying some generic dolls (that way I can assign them any identity I want) and having them as friends. I'll talk to them, watch tv with them, and even surf the web with them too. I don't *want* to do this, but the loneliness is becoming overwhelming.",0,"the narrative describes a person considering creating fake friends out of dolls to combat their loneliness. the individual mentions talking to these dolls, watching tv with them, and even surfing the web together. although these actions suggest a coping mechanism for loneliness, the explicit statement about the overwhelming nature of their loneliness and the fact that they do not want to resort to this measure indicates a strong feeling of isolation. this is a clear manifestation of loneliness, as the individual is actively seeking companionship, even if it means creating imaginary friends. the desperation and creativity in finding ways to mitigate their loneliness are typical indicators of someone experiencing significant social isolation."
"I just need one comment telling me something. Literally anything. Even a Hi will do tbh.20 years old. Recently realised I have absolutely no actual friends. My classmates are just my classmates. Neighbours just neighbours. In class when I??m with my ??group?? they talk about random stuff and wait for me leave so they can make plans. And I get to know they were out only after seeing pictures on their Instagram. I never ask for clarification. They never bother. I spend most of the time thinking about exactly this. Some tips to get over this would be highly appreciated. If not just leave your greetings. :)
Stay blessed.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction and connection, which is a common human experience. the individual mentions feeling isolated from classmates and neighbors, but this situation is often encountered during transitional life phases, such as young adulthood. the mention of classmates and neighbors as distinct groups suggests that the person has not yet integrated these relationships into deeper friendships, which is typical for many people. the narrative also highlights a passive approach to social interaction, where the person waits for others to initiate contact. this behavior can be seen as a normal part of learning social skills and navigating social dynamics. the request for tips or even a simple greeting indicates a proactive step towards seeking support and improving their situation, which shows resilience and a willingness to change. overall, while the person acknowledges feelings of isolation, the narrative reflects a common struggle with social integration rather than deep-seated loneliness."
What??s the Catch???for a depressed piece of garbage i??m very social (because i want to make friends) and go to new events and reach out to people (because i want to make friends) and guess what? i still have no friends!! what the f:ck ,0,"the narrative, despite the frustration and use of harsh language, reflects an individual who is actively engaging in social activities and making efforts to connect with others. they mention attending new events and reaching out to people, which indicates a proactive approach to building social connections. while there is an expression of disappointment about the lack of friends, the continuous effort to socialize suggests resilience and a desire for companionship rather than isolation. the person's active social behavior and persistent attempts to form friendships are not typical indicators of loneliness, as loneliness often involves withdrawal and a lack of social interaction."
I joined r/lonely to help people anyone and everyoneAs the tittle says i want to help everyone and anyone here so if you feel lonely chat me up if you feel sad chat me up i will try my best to cheer you up you want a friend the chat me freely you want someone to talk to i dont mind i like hearing other peoples problems so i can help them i want to help anyone and everyone here so feel free to chat with me mates wish you a good day,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who expresses a strong desire to help others and be a source of support for those feeling lonely or sad. the person offers their time and willingness to listen to others' problems, which suggests a proactive and empathetic approach towards social interaction. this behavior indicates a sense of purpose and connection with others, which are not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. the use of phrases like ""i want to help everyone and anyone"" and ""feel free to chat with me"" demonstrates an outward focus and a readiness to engage socially, both of which are positive indicators of social well-being. the overall tone of the narrative is one of generosity and openness, further supporting the absence of loneliness."

I miss deep cry for something. 

I have never before talked about it to anyone Bcos I was not sure myself if I'm really attracted to sadness but now I know. I wonder is there something wrong with Me? Or there is more people who feel like me?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's complex relationship with sadness, where they express an attraction to negative emotions and a preference for solitude over social interaction. they describe a sense of beauty in sadness and cry, which may suggest a form of emotional regulation or coping mechanism. despite their negative feelings towards others who are happy, they do not express a desire to change their situation or a longing for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they seem to have accepted and even embraced their emotional state, suggesting a level of self-awareness and acceptance that is not commonly associated with loneliness. their inquiry about whether others feel the same way indicates a curiosity rather than a cry for help or connection. this narrative portrays a nuanced emotional experience that does not align with the typical markers of loneliness, such as a yearning for social interaction or feelings of isolation and abandonment."
"No one is ever attracted/interested in meI relocated halfway across the world in September 2020 to ourse my masters and this has been the loneliest if ever been in life. No one finds me attractive, I don??t know what it??s like to have a girl curious to know me and, needless to say, COVID hasn??t helped. It so painful and disheartening trying and getting rejected over and over and over again. I see people I know meeting people and getting closer with them whilst everyone seems to push me away. This sh*t sucks man :(",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of social isolation and rejection, which the author attributes to their physical relocation and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the author expresses feelings of unattractiveness and repeated rejection, which are common indicators of loneliness. they observe others forming connections while they feel pushed away, intensifying their sense of exclusion and emotional pain. the language used, such as ""loneliest i've ever been,"" ""disheartening,"" and ""this sh*t sucks,"" conveys a deep emotional struggle and frustration. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness, highlighting the emotional toll of social disconnection and unfulfilled desires for companionship."
It took a man whose profession was putting holes in people to be the first man who understood and loved me... and I'm left with to pick up the pieces. I just want to feel at peace.[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional experience, highlighting the impact of a significant relationship with a person whose profession involved violence. despite the profound nature of this connection and the subsequent emotional aftermath, there is an underlying tone of resilience and a desire for peace. the individual acknowledges the need to ""pick up the pieces,"" suggesting a proactive approach to healing and self-care. while the narrative contains elements of loss and the search for understanding, it does not predominantly express the pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on personal growth and the pursuit of inner peace, indicating a level of emotional support and self-awareness that counters the typical indicators of loneliness."
"Anyone down to chat?It's almost 4am here and I'm just really bored, if anyone is down to chat just shoot me a pm!",0,"the narrative suggests an individual seeking social interaction out of boredom rather than loneliness. the request for a chat at 4am indicates a desire for engagement during a time when they might typically be awake and active, possibly due to a non-traditional schedule. the language used is casual and lacks any deeper expression of emotional distress or isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on finding someone to alleviate boredom, implying that the individual may have other social connections or activities that typically fulfill their social needs. the absence of words expressing feelings of sadness, emptiness, or a lack of meaningful connections further supports the classification. thus, the narrative reflects a temporary state of seeking entertainment rather than a chronic sense of loneliness."
Would love a cuddleI'd like to held right now :/,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical affection, which is a common human need and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of casual language and the emoticon suggests a light-hearted tone rather than deep emotional distress. wanting a cuddle or to be held can be a momentary craving for comfort and connection, which many people experience from time to time. this kind of expression is often seen in individuals who may feel content overall but seek a brief moment of intimacy. the lack of more profound or pervasive feelings of isolation and the straightforward nature of the statement indicate a temporary and situational desire rather than chronic loneliness."

Never done this before or posted on reddit, can you message people on reddit or like?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking to express themselves and explore their feelings, particularly about topics they find difficult to discuss with people they know. their openness about their interests, such as music, arts, and cutting-edge science, indicates a well-rounded personality with a variety of passions. their curiosity about new experiences and self-development suggests a proactive approach to personal growth. while they mention feelings of loneliness, the context implies they are not overwhelmed by it but rather looking for a constructive outlet to discuss and process their emotions. the inclusion of activities like meditation and outdoor adventures indicates a balanced lifestyle and an interest in maintaining mental and physical well-being. overall, the narrative suggests a person who is managing their feelings of loneliness through healthy coping mechanisms and a desire for self-improvement."
Does anyone wonder if they are going to be single forever?23(M) here. Never had a relationship. Enjoy being single but desire companionship and a relationship. And obviously everything else in between. Seems like something so surreal and will always be kept at arms reach for me.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is contemplating their relationship status and future possibilities. while they express a desire for companionship and acknowledge never having been in a relationship, there is an underlying tone of acceptance and contentment with their current single status. the mention of enjoying being single suggests a level of self-sufficiency and independence, which are not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. the curiosity about the future and the sense that a relationship feels surreal and just out of reach might indicate some level of uncertainty or longing, but it does not necessarily equate to loneliness. instead, it reflects a common human experience of wondering about one's future and the possibilities it holds. the narrative lacks expressions of deep sadness, isolation, or despair, which are more definitive indicators of loneliness. overall, the individual's self-reflection and acceptance of their current state suggest they are not experiencing significant loneliness."

Maybe i'm just a bitch.",0,"the narrative reflects a preference for one-on-one interactions over group settings, highlighting a desire for intimate and meaningful connections. the author expresses frustration with constant interruptions that hinder deeper conversations, which suggests a longing for uninterrupted personal communication rather than a sense of isolation. the mention of trying to build something with another person indicates an active effort to form a bond, despite external challenges. while there is some self-doubt and questioning of compatibility, these sentiments do not necessarily point to loneliness but rather to difficulties in achieving desired social dynamics. the emphasis on the need for privacy and direct communication is more indicative of a specific communication style rather than an overarching feeling of loneliness."
"A message for college studentsSince I know there are a lot of high school and college age people in this group, a word of advice from a graduate who was very lonely in college is to find clubs to join where you have a common interest with the people there. It's an instant social circle. I made a lot of friends in college that way and we had some good times. I miss it very much. You can also find local clubs through Meetup. It's worth a shot if you truly want a social circle. Shared interest is the fastest way to make friends.",0,"the narrative provides advice from a graduate who experienced loneliness in college but successfully overcame it by joining clubs with shared interests. the writer emphasizes the importance of finding social circles through common interests, suggesting that this approach was effective for them. they reflect positively on their college friendships and express a sense of nostalgia, indicating that they valued and enjoyed those social connections. the practical tips and positive tone suggest a proactive and hopeful outlook, which are not typical indicators of current loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on strategies for building social connections, reflecting a sense of empowerment and satisfaction with past experiences."
So many young people are lonely it is SO messed up[removed],0,"the narrative highlights a concern about the loneliness experienced by many young people, but it does not provide any personal context or feelings from the author themselves. instead, it focuses on a broader social issue without delving into the author's own emotional state or personal experiences. this suggests that the author is observing and commenting on a societal problem rather than expressing their own loneliness. typically, narratives from lonely individuals include personal anecdotes, expressions of isolation, or descriptions of emotional pain, none of which are present here. the detachment and generalization in the narrative indicate a more external perspective rather than an internal, personal struggle with loneliness."
"There's nothing worse than being too ugly for loveNo one wants to give me the time of day because I look like a goofy 12 year old at 24. I honestly really want to just die at this point. Not only does no one give me a chance, but I'm always laughed at too. No one cares ive been loveless and sexless for years. No one cares if I'm breathing. I know don't either. 

Love compassion and acceptance is too much to ask if you were born with bad dreams",0,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of frustration and self-deprecation related to perceived physical unattractiveness. the individual expresses a sense of hopelessness and despair, believing that their appearance prevents them from forming romantic relationships or being taken seriously. however, the focus is heavily on self-image and societal rejection rather than an intrinsic sense of loneliness. the repeated emphasis on not being given a chance, being laughed at, and feeling unlovable points to a struggle with self-esteem and external validation. while these issues can contribute to feelings of isolation, the narrative does not delve into the emotional experience of loneliness itself. instead, it highlights a perceived external barrier (appearance) as the primary source of distress."
"I'm from India.Anyone here? G??Enerally people from India are never so Skeptic that they're never Alone  but a Few , and this Sucks balls. Especially when it comes to the z Man, its obvious.   

Being a Democratic community saves more   , but people are left behind  seems like they don't care about anyone but the majority.  

Anyone knew what it would take for me?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and discontent with the social and political environment rather than a deep personal feeling of loneliness. the author mentions being from india and expresses dissatisfaction with how the majority is treated versus the minority. this suggests a broader social critique rather than an intimate personal struggle with loneliness. the use of phrases like ""people from india are never so skeptic that they're never alone"" indicates an awareness of communal connections and social dynamics, even if these are not always favorable. the author's query about what it would take for them seems more directed towards understanding societal change rather than seeking personal companionship or expressing isolation. these elements suggest that the narrative is more about societal observations and frustrations rather than a personal experience of loneliness."
I GOT A GIRLFRIENDHOLY SHIT I DID IT I GOT A GF AAAAAAAAAAAAA,0,"the narrative expresses a significant moment of joy and excitement, indicating the presence of a romantic relationship. the use of exclamatory language and repeated emphasis on having a girlfriend suggests a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. such positive emotional expression and the context of forming a new, intimate connection are typically not associated with loneliness. instead, they reflect social bonding and personal satisfaction. these elements collectively point towards an individual who is experiencing happiness and connection rather than feelings of isolation or loneliness."
"AcceptanceI'm sure you've all heard this song story before. Always the ""best friend"" or guy they ""wish more guys were like.""

I'm in my early twenties, but it feels like it's time to accept the fact that maybe I might just never find ""the one"", whatever that is. What do you guys think? How does one keep trying when you're always only the second option or a throw away?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with feelings of rejection and self-doubt, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. they describe a recurring pattern of being seen as a friend rather than a romantic partner, which leads to frustration and resignation. however, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional isolation or a pervasive sense of disconnection from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author questions their worth and future prospects in relationships, but this is framed more as a situational struggle rather than an overarching sense of loneliness. their engagement with the audience by asking for advice also suggests a level of social interaction and a desire for connection, further indicating that their experiences may not be rooted in loneliness."
"Laughing while attempting to cryI dunno maybe it just my subconscious or my way of growing that I shouldn't cry at everything or anything and just man up, I wanted to cry now lately but I wasnt able to much maybe a small tear drop here and there but that it. Just now I sorta laughed while attempting to cry again and i can feel my heart breaking because of that like that's all I can do.",0,"the narrative describes a struggle with expressing emotions, particularly crying, which the individual attributes to subconscious influences or societal expectations to ""man up."" while there is mention of a breaking heart and the difficulty in crying, the presence of laughter suggests a complex emotional response rather than a straightforward expression of loneliness. the individual's awareness of their emotional state and the attempt to rationalize their inability to cry indicate a level of self-reflection and emotional processing. these factors suggest that the person is navigating their emotions rather than experiencing profound loneliness. the laughter amidst the attempt to cry could be seen as a coping mechanism or a way to mitigate emotional pain, rather than a sign of deep isolation."
"I thought I was getting betterI really thought I was getting better, I havnt cut in abt a week I'm finally getting stuff back on track but suicide is still on my mind alot. I feel like I could just start crying at any point, I kinda think I wasn't getting better but rather suppressing my emotion. It's kinda discouraging because know I feel like even if will get better it won't be good, it will just be a little better than it is know.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with mental health, specifically mentioning self-harm and suicidal thoughts. however, the individual also describes a sense of progress, as they haven't engaged in self-harm for a week and are attempting to get their life back on track. the expression of discouragement and emotional suppression indicates an internal battle, but it does not necessarily point to loneliness. the focus is more on the individual's internal state and personal mental health journey rather than a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation. the absence of references to social interactions or a desire for connection suggests that loneliness may not be the primary issue here. instead, the narrative centers on the complexities of mental health recovery and the individual's perception of their progress and emotional state."
"Anyone wanna talk a little bit ? About anythingNot looking for a relationship or anything like that, just want someone to talk to. Play a lot of video games and love MMA",0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking casual conversation and connection without the deeper emotional undertones often associated with loneliness. the request for someone to talk to about ""anything"" and the mention of interests like video games and mma suggest a desire for social interaction rather than a plea for emotional support. the tone is casual and straightforward, indicating that the individual is open to socializing but not necessarily experiencing the profound sense of isolation or emotional distress that typically characterizes loneliness. their emphasis on not looking for a relationship further supports the idea that they are content with their current social state and simply wish to engage in light, enjoyable conversation."
"I can feel my heart breakingIt??s at times a sharp jolt, or an aching (has been diagnosed as angina/panic disorder) and at times a feeling of crumpling cartilage. Broken heart syndrome is a thing, but apparently my heart is resilient and won??t let me just go. It??s interesting to me how emotions manifest in the physical body.",0,"the narrative describes intense physical sensations linked to emotional experiences, such as a sharp jolt or aching, which have been medically diagnosed as angina or panic disorder. the author reflects on the concept of broken heart syndrome but notes their heart's resilience. while the narrative explores the connection between emotions and physical symptoms, it lacks specific indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of social isolation, longing for companionship, or descriptions of a lack of meaningful connections. instead, the focus is on the physiological impact of emotions and the author's curiosity about how these emotions manifest physically. this introspective and somewhat detached analysis suggests a level of self-awareness and coping that may not be typically associated with the deep emotional distress and social disconnection characteristic of loneliness."
Well.Does anyone else think that the people they meet through life are just a means to an end?,0,"the narrative reflects a philosophical or existential viewpoint rather than a personal emotional state. the question posed seems to focus on the nature of human relationships in a broader sense, possibly hinting at a cynical or utilitarian perspective on social interactions. this kind of outlook is not necessarily indicative of loneliness; instead, it suggests a contemplative or critical approach to understanding human connections. there are no direct expressions of isolation, longing for companionship, or emotional distress that typically characterize loneliness. the language used is impersonal and abstract, focusing on the concept of people as ""means to an end"" rather than expressing a personal feeling of being disconnected or alone. such a narrative can be seen as an intellectual exploration of social dynamics rather than a reflection of one's emotional experience of loneliness."
"Idk anymore..I just idk any more... I feel like walking out on everything, Just leave it all behind. You'd think I'd be happy starting a new job after recently losing mine and having no income but with everything in my head Im struggling... I just need some comfort ???? but I'm alone I have no one.. no one to vent to or lean on... I'm sick of falling apart on a day to day basis and breaking down... Idk anymore",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of struggle and emotional turmoil, which can be associated with significant life changes and stress. the individual expresses feelings of wanting to leave everything behind and mentions the distress of losing a job and starting a new one. despite these challenges, the text also indicates a lack of social support, with statements about having no one to vent to or lean on. these expressions of isolation and the desire for comfort are common indicators of loneliness. however, the narrative's context might also suggest a temporary state of distress rather than a chronic sense of loneliness, potentially influenced by recent events rather than a pervasive feeling of being alone. the intensity of the emotional experience and the mention of daily breakdowns highlight the need for support and coping mechanisms, which are crucial for mental health stability."
today??s my birthday &amp; i wanna die :)i literally hate existing ????????????????????????????,0,"the narrative reflects a strong expression of distress and dissatisfaction with life, particularly on a significant personal occasion like a birthday. however, the use of intense language and dramatic punctuation suggests an outburst of negative emotions rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, and a longing for companionship. in contrast, this narrative focuses more on self-loathing and existential frustration without mentioning any desire for social interaction or the absence of supportive relationships. while the emotions expressed are severe, they do not specifically indicate the presence of loneliness. instead, they point towards other possible mental health issues such as depression or acute emotional distress."

Might as well remind myself of the truth that everyone thinks about me every day. I wouldn't be spending every weekend alone otherwise.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-loathing and negative self-perception, which can often be associated with feelings of isolation. the repeated affirmations of worthlessness and the belief that these thoughts are shared by others suggest a significant internal struggle with self-esteem. however, the context provided by the label indicates that these expressions might not necessarily stem from loneliness but rather from a broader issue of self-identity and societal perception. the focus on physical appearance, intelligence, and capability points to an internalization of societal stereotypes and discrimination. the mention of spending weekends alone could be a symptom of social withdrawal, yet the primary narrative revolves around self-hate rather than a longing for connection. thus, while the narrative is filled with elements that could suggest loneliness, it is more accurately interpreted as an expression of deep-seated self-rejection and societal alienation."
Hey what??s up dm me on Instagram so we can talk @moneystar3kHey what??s up dm me on Instagram so we can talk @moneystar3k,0,"the narrative appears to be an open and casual invitation for conversation, which is generally indicative of a person who is socially engaged and seeking interaction in a confident manner. the repetition of the message and inclusion of a social media handle suggest a desire for connection, but it does not necessarily imply loneliness. rather, it reflects a proactive approach to communication, typical of someone who is comfortable reaching out and engaging with others. the tone is upbeat and informal, lacking any signs of distress or isolation that are often present in narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness. the direct and assertive nature of the message further supports the interpretation that the author is not exhibiting signs of loneliness, but rather a sociable and outgoing demeanor."
Anyone wanna just talk for a lil going through a rough time.Lost a friendship not feeling good.,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for conversation and mentions going through a rough time, including the loss of a friendship and not feeling good. while these elements suggest the individual is experiencing distress and seeking social support, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the request to talk and the acknowledgment of specific events like losing a friendship are indicative of someone reaching out for immediate support rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation. this suggests that the individual may have other social connections or coping mechanisms in place and is looking for a temporary uplift rather than dealing with chronic loneliness. the focus on a specific incident rather than a broader feeling of being alone aligns more with situational sadness or stress rather than loneliness."
"I can't do anythingI have a lot to do. But I couldn't. The emptiness is so painful and I became a dead man walking. I wish I had someone who would hug me until I feel okay. But, at this point, even the smallest touches make me uncomfortable. Fuck this.",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of emptiness and struggle, which can be indicative of various psychological states, but certain aspects suggest that loneliness might not be the primary issue. the expression of feeling like a ""dead man walking"" and the wish for someone to hug them until they feel okay indicate a desire for comfort and connection, which could be seen in many emotional struggles, not just loneliness. the discomfort with physical touch, even though they crave it, hints at a more complex emotional or psychological condition. while loneliness often involves a longing for social connection, the narrative here seems more focused on an internal battle with emotional pain and a sense of helplessness. the frustration and use of strong language further suggest an intense emotional turmoil that might be more related to depression or another mental health issue rather than loneliness alone."
"I lost both my dogs todayboth of my babies died today. 
losing one dog is hard. i just lost both. 

we think someone poisoned them or they got into something toxic and now they??re both dead. 
yesterday we had two dogs and now we just don??t. 
idk how ima do this. those were my babies.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of grief and loss due to the sudden death of two beloved pets. while the emotions expressed are intense and painful, they are centered around the specific event of losing the dogs rather than a broader, ongoing feeling of loneliness. the writer talks about the immediate shock and sorrow, indicating a situational response to a tragic incident. there is no mention of prolonged isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being alone in a broader context. the focus is on the acute emotional distress caused by the loss, which is a natural reaction to such a significant event, rather than a reflection of chronic loneliness."
"I can't keep friendsI'm a pretty talkative person and relatively good with people in my immediate vicinity, but away from people I basically have no contact with people. Like I used to be great friends with people in school or on my rugby team, but I almost never talked to anyone outside of those things. I'd hang out with people in my departments lounge or after classes, and I'd hang with rugby team mates before or after practices and games. But outside those situations there would be no contact.

2 years ago I moved to a different country for school and work and the situation repeated itself. Now with the lock down and my moving to a new town the problem has compounded itself.

I don't talk to anyone from home really, as soon as I left high school most of the people I knew dropped away, same for college and then university. Rugby kinda stayed even as I kept playing, but since I moved I've talked to about a dozen people or less from my old life.

I just don't think I'm really friends with anyone, I was just adjacent to people until either I or they moved off",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is sociable and capable of forming connections in specific contexts, such as school, sports teams, and professional environments. the person describes having had meaningful interactions and friendships during these periods, indicating a natural ability to engage with others. however, the difficulty lies in maintaining these relationships outside structured settings. the current situation, including moving to a new country and the lockdown, has exacerbated this challenge. despite these obstacles, the individual's awareness of the issue and their past ability to connect with others suggest they are not inherently lonely, but rather facing situational difficulties in sustaining long-term relationships. this is a common experience for many people who thrive in structured social environments but struggle with continuity once those structures are removed."
"I have a video on dealing with loneliness. I hope it can help you guys :)Hey guys! I found a video today about dealing with loneliness and I thought it would be helpful to share it to you guys. I hope the video helps :)  

video here ([https://youtu.be/cojRFsrJKDk](https://youtu.be/cojRFsrJKDk))",0,"the narrative demonstrates a proactive and outward-focused approach, where the individual is sharing a resource they believe could be beneficial to others. this behavior indicates a sense of community and a desire to support peers, which is not typical of someone experiencing loneliness. the tone is positive and encouraging, suggesting the author is engaged and empathetic rather than isolated. they express hope that the video will help others, implying a connection to and concern for the well-being of their audience. these elements reflect an outward orientation and social engagement, which are inconsistent with feelings of loneliness."
Anyone else being teased or bullied or school?It happens to me in school... Sorry if you are.,0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is experiencing teasing or bullying at school, which can be distressing. however, the way the person addresses the audience with empathy and concern suggests a level of social connection and awareness of others' experiences. the phrase ""sorry if you are"" indicates that the author is considering the feelings of others and is not solely focused on their own distress. this outward concern and the attempt to connect with others who might be going through similar experiences are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they suggest that the individual is seeking to form bonds and is capable of empathizing with peers, which are signs of social engagement rather than isolation."
"Last friend said she isn't in the mood to speak to me anymoreThat was three days ago and it still hurts, guess I'm just disposable to the people in my life.",0,"the narrative describes a recent and painful interaction where the author’s last friend expressed a desire not to communicate anymore, leaving the author feeling hurt and disposable. however, the classification suggests that this instance might be an isolated event rather than a reflection of chronic loneliness. typical indicators of loneliness often include a prolonged sense of isolation, lack of meaningful connections over time, and pervasive feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected. in this case, the author’s distress seems to stem from a specific incident rather than a consistent pattern of social disconnection. the use of phrases like ""last friend"" and ""disposable"" indicates acute emotional pain, but without additional context suggesting a broader, ongoing experience of loneliness, it appears more situational. this distinction is crucial in understanding the difference between temporary emotional reactions and sustained feelings of loneliness."
It??s my birthday and I??m sooooo alone????As the title says,0,"the narrative, while expressing a sense of solitude on a significant day, does not necessarily indicate a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the use of playful punctuation and elongated words like ""sooooo"" suggests a lighthearted or even humorous tone rather than one of profound sadness or isolation. this kind of expression might be typical of someone who is momentarily alone but not necessarily feeling a chronic or deep-seated loneliness. the context of it being a birthday might amplify the feeling of wanting company, but the overall tone does not convey the depth of emotional distress typically associated with loneliness."
I??m angryPlease help me. I can??t take it!!!!!!!!,0,"the narrative reflects a state of anger and frustration, but there are no clear indicators of loneliness. the plea for help suggests a desire for support, yet it doesn't necessarily imply a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation. the intensity of the emotions expressed may be linked to a specific incident or stressor rather than a chronic sense of loneliness. typically, loneliness narratives include mentions of feeling disconnected, isolated, or lacking meaningful relationships, none of which are present here. the focus is on an immediate emotional response rather than a prolonged experience of solitude or social detachment."
"Why does it seem like so few people are genuine?It's kind of like a multiplayer game, where 90% of people just seem like pre-programmed NPCs with pre-programmed responses, while very few of them are even remotely polarizing.

I think that's why I feel so lonely but not sure. Would like to discuss this!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disillusionment with the authenticity of others, comparing people to pre-programmed npcs in a multiplayer game. this metaphor suggests a perception that most interactions lack depth or genuine connection. however, the author's curiosity and desire to discuss these feelings indicate a proactive approach to understanding their emotions, which is not typically indicative of deep loneliness. the expression of confusion about their feelings and the invitation for discussion point to an openness to engage with others and seek clarity, suggesting that while they may feel disconnected at times, they are not entrenched in loneliness. this proactive stance and willingness to explore their feelings with others is a significant indicator of their overall emotional state."
"We have so many different peopleWe have lot of people which have different opinions, different languages and nationalities, different preferences about food, music, games, books, activites and much more. They have various bad sides and good sides, likes and dislikes. This young man likes to do hiking, and this old woman likes to play video games. Yet still im keeping hearing that this is good to be yourself and thats a paradox, because when you want  to have anyone on your side you have to do whats fashionablea and not what YOU REALLY want to do.",0,"the narrative discusses the diversity of people and their preferences, highlighting the differences in opinions, languages, nationalities, and activities. the author reflects on the notion of being oneself versus conforming to social trends to gain acceptance. despite mentioning a paradox about individuality and social acceptance, the narrative lacks personal expressions of isolation or emotional distress. instead, it focuses on general observations about societal behavior and individual choices without delving into feelings of loneliness or disconnection. the presence of a reflective tone on social dynamics rather than a personal account of loneliness suggests the author is more engaged in contemplating societal norms than experiencing loneliness themselves."
Can someone please please talk to me[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a direct and urgent plea for communication, which could initially suggest a sense of isolation. however, the context and specific wording do not provide sufficient evidence of deeper emotional distress or chronic loneliness. the use of ""please please"" indicates a momentary desire for interaction rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express more prolonged feelings of emptiness, lack of connection, or descriptions of ongoing social isolation. in this case, the narrative seems more indicative of a transient need for social engagement rather than a sustained state of loneliness."
"For those who might be struggling a little more because of the holidays, from a 911 dispatcher.I??m not really sure why I even started to type this out. Maybe it??s my own way of coping because I??m fortunate that my job allows me to help people by talking them through their crisis. Maybe it??s what I wish someone would tell me?? I don??t really know.

The past two years have been so tremendously challenging, but the holidays only amplify that loneliness when you can??t even surround yourself with the loved ones that you so dearly miss. For some, today might not feel all that merry, because it feels like everything but. Maybe you??ve lost a loved one, or you feel like you??ve lost yourself. Maybe you don??t even have the family that you once did, either because you feel like you??ve been abandoned, that you??re not good enough, or that you??re not lovable enough. That you??re so broken, you don??t feel like anything could ever fix you. 

Please know that you do deserve to be loved. You are worth it. You deserve to be here. You are enough. You are not broken. 

You deserve to live. 

I work as a 911 dispatcher, and over the years, I have heard so many cries for help from people who just want someone to listen. For someone to actually hear what they??re saying because they feel like no one else will. Some of the voices I??ve heard are so desperate for someone, anyone to care, because no one in their life has shown that they do. Some people are lonely, and just want someone to talk to. I??m grateful that my job allows me to ease some of the burden that a person might be feeling, that I can take some of the weight off of their shoulders. I??m grateful that I can listen to them, that I can tell them that someone does care about them, and I can help them get the resources that they need. 

But there have also been times when that persons burden was just too much, that nothing I could have done would have ever had been enough to convince them that they were worth it. That they felt the weight of their struggle was just too heavy, and that the world would just be better off without them. I couldn??t save them, because they didn??t feel like they deserved to be saved. 

But every single one of them did deserve to be saved. They all deserved to live. 

If you??re struggling and you just need someone to talk to, I am here to listen to you, to hear you. If you??re feeling lonely and just need a friend, I??ll be the best damn friend I possibly can be for you. If you need help, I will do my best to get you to someone that can help you if I??m not able to be the help that you need. But please don??t feel like you need to struggle on your own. I know the weight of the world can get to be so heavy, that it feels like nothing could ever be enough to lift any of it off of your tired shoulders. But please know that there is help for you. If you??re not sure how to find it, I??ll be there with you every step of the way until we do. I promise not to judge you, and if you just need someone to talk at, I will gladly just listen without telling you how to fix a problem that you??re not asking me to fix. 

You are worth it. You are a good person who deserves to be here. You deserve to feel happy.  

You deserve to live.

Well I do",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of empathy and a strong desire to help others who are struggling, particularly during the holidays. the author, a 911 dispatcher, expresses gratitude for their ability to provide support and comfort to those in crisis. they acknowledge the challenging nature of their job and the emotional toll it can take, yet they find fulfillment in being able to make a difference in others' lives. the dispatcher’s reflections on loneliness and the struggles people face are insightful and compassionate, but they do not indicate personal loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on the author's role in alleviating others' loneliness and the satisfaction derived from their work. the repeated affirmations and reassurances suggest a deep commitment to supporting others rather than an expression of their own feelings of isolation. the mention of specific examples, such as people feeling abandoned or unlovable, serves to illustrate the experiences of those they help, not their own personal state. the overall tone is one of altruism and professional dedication, highlighting the importance of human connection and support without indicating the author’s own loneliness."
"Depressed...A lot of shit has come to light recently for me. My wife of 10 years says she is no longer in love with me. After hearing this, I started to think about who I was as a person and I feel very broken. I know I haven't been who she needed me to be. I have never been able to communicate my feelings to her. I am scared of who I actually am. I can't open up to anyone. I use alcohol to cope a lot with my feelings. My wife knows it and fucking hates it but I can't stop. I have unresolved feelings from a deployment 8 years ago. I truly don't like who I am. I currently hate work and cannot find happiness in it. My family is my true happiness but yet I don't treat them like that. 

My wife believes I do not love her and I know I do. 

We agreed to try marriage counseling but I am afraid her mind is made up. I also agreed to start opening up to her but I kind of feel I don't know how to do that.

I told her I will seek counseling for myself start working on me.

What are things that I can do? I need to figure out who I am as a person and fix me. I cannot lose her. She is my entire world along with my 3 children.",0,"the narrative presents a deeply emotional and troubled state of mind, characterized by feelings of depression, self-doubt, and fear of losing important relationships. the individual expresses a sense of being broken and unworthy, struggling with unresolved issues from the past and an inability to communicate effectively. despite these challenges, the narrative also highlights the presence of a support system, including a wife and children who are central to the individual's sense of happiness and purpose. the willingness to seek marriage counseling and personal therapy indicates a proactive approach to addressing these issues, suggesting a foundation of hope and determination. the expression of love for the family and the desire to improve and not lose them are significant aspects that reflect an underlying connection and support network, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these elements suggest that the individual is experiencing a difficult period but is not isolated or devoid of meaningful relationships."
"Let's daydream a bit!We all would love to find a friend/partner in any way, but I bet many of you have some favourite circumstances in which they would get what they're looking for. Let's share our ideal scenarios!

For example, I'd love to meet a girl through one of the online games I'm playing, someone who I would connect with. Text with her everyday, and play games together. And when we would feel comfortable with that, finaly meet up for the first time (maybe she'd pick me up from an airport/train station) and give each other a lovely, long, comforting hug. Take a walk to a lovely place as our first real-life date, and maybe spend the rest of the day playing games together.

Keep in mind these are just the ""perfect"" scenarios, of course I would love to find love in any other way and it would still be the greatest thing :)",0,"the narrative expresses a hopeful and positive outlook on finding a meaningful connection, focusing on ideal scenarios rather than expressing distress or a sense of isolation. the author envisions joyful and specific experiences, such as meeting someone through online games and sharing enjoyable activities like texting daily and playing games together. the tone is light-hearted and imaginative, suggesting a sense of contentment with the current situation and an optimistic view of potential relationships. this imaginative daydreaming does not convey desperation or sadness, but rather a healthy desire for companionship. the emphasis on flexibility and openness to finding love in various ways further indicates a balanced and hopeful perspective, typical of someone not experiencing significant loneliness."
"Kinda want my ex to wish me a happy birthdayToday is my birthday and we have broken up for 3 months with no contact and although I shouldn??t expect anything, it feels a little sad not to hear anything from her. Woke up, checked my phone to see if there was anything from her but there was nothing so I shouldn??t be surprised. The breakup was brutal, but a part of my subconscious wants her to say happy birthday to me. For some reason, I just feel some sadness and I shouldn??t be because it??s my birthday. It??s still hard to cope with me because she usually says happy birthday when it??s midnight and she was my also first everything. I can??t believe it??s just over. I thought I was doing fine but it sucks when the person who you spent so much time with is gone, and the feeling of loneliness still lingers :/",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of longing and sadness, particularly centered around the absence of a birthday message from an ex-partner. despite this, the individual acknowledges the lack of expectation and seems to understand that it's natural to feel this way given the recent breakup. the mention of checking the phone and feeling sad but not surprised indicates a realistic grasp of the situation rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation. the individual expresses a rational understanding of their emotions, suggesting that while there is a lingering sadness from the breakup, it doesn't dominate their overall emotional state. the narrative shows awareness of the situation and a reasonable response to the end of a significant relationship, which are not typical indicators of profound loneliness. instead, these feelings are more aligned with the normal emotional aftermath of a breakup."
"Objectively speaking, no one cares.[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a sense of detachment or cynicism, but it lacks deeper introspective or emotional cues that typically indicate loneliness. the statement ""objectively speaking, no one cares"" reflects a generalized and possibly defensive viewpoint rather than a personal experience of isolation. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe feelings of longing for connection, specific instances of being overlooked, or emotional pain stemming from social disconnection. in contrast, this narrative's tone is more dismissive and could be indicative of a philosophical stance or a momentary expression of frustration rather than a chronic sense of loneliness. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional depth further supports the classification, as it does not delve into the personal impact of social isolation."
"idk. im so lostthe thing is ,I don't know what I want. like, I'll sit here and complain that I'm lonely or that I want love, and then suddenly there's all these people in my dms who want me and want my attention and want to be with me, but like....its not enough. like, my entire life, theres always been something missing, and idk what it is. and I look for it in every person that I meet, every place that I go, and everything that I see, and when I cant find it I get disappointed. im always disappointed and empty and idk whats missing. and I know I'm only 18 and I've got plenty of time to figure things out, but im just so tired and sad all the time, all because I'm looking for something that probably doesn't even exist.",0,"the narrative reflects a state of confusion and existential searching rather than loneliness. the individual expresses a sense of being lost and unsure of what they want in life, despite receiving attention from others. this indicates that their feelings of emptiness are not due to a lack of social interaction or companionship, but rather an internal struggle to find meaning and fulfillment. the mention of being tired and sad all the time suggests emotional fatigue and possibly symptoms of depression, but it does not necessarily point to loneliness. the individual's acknowledgment of their young age and the time they have to figure things out further supports the idea that their distress is more about personal growth and self-discovery rather than social isolation. overall, the narrative highlights a deeper quest for purpose and identity, which is distinct from the experience of loneliness."
I??m in a wheelchair I think that explains I??m here lmaoI??m a piece of shit tbh,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and self-deprecating tone, which suggests a level of social engagement and humor that is often not present in individuals experiencing significant loneliness. the use of ""lmao"" indicates the author is attempting to infuse humor into their situation, suggesting they might have a social audience or at least an expectation of one. while the statement ""i'm a piece of shit tbh"" shows self-criticism, it lacks the deeper, pervasive sense of isolation or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. rather, it reads more as a candid, albeit harsh, self-assessment that could be part of a broader, socially interactive persona. the narrative does not exhibit signs of social withdrawal, longing for connection, or expressions of emotional emptiness that are common indicators of loneliness."
Not having friends for 10+ years fucks you up[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a long period without friends, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, there is a notable lack of emotional language or personal reflection that typically accompanies feelings of loneliness. the statement is blunt and factual, devoid of the deeper introspection or expression of sadness, isolation, or yearning for connection that often characterizes narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness. this straightforward presentation could imply a level of acceptance or detachment from the situation, which might suggest that the individual has adapted to their circumstances and does not necessarily feel lonely. the absence of a detailed emotional account or a plea for connection supports the classification."
"SongsWhat artists/music help you through your dark period? Lil Peep and Giveon help me a lot, like they are telling my story. Do you have any recommendations?",0,"the narrative reflects a search for emotional support through music, which is a common coping mechanism. the mention of artists like lil peep and giveon, who often explore themes of struggle and vulnerability in their songs, suggests the individual finds solace and relatability in their music. asking for recommendations indicates a proactive approach to managing their emotions and seeking out resources that resonate with their experiences. while there is an acknowledgment of experiencing dark periods, the act of reaching out for music recommendations and connecting with the stories told by these artists shows a level of engagement and resourcefulness that is typically not associated with deep loneliness. this behavior demonstrates an awareness of personal needs and a willingness to seek out and utilize external sources of comfort and understanding."
"Went to the beach on my own today...Did a pretty big thing today... after reading the numerous posts and comments from people saying doing stuff on their own is awesome and arguably better than with others motivated me to drive 1.5 hours to my nearest beach today.. and yikes... that was hard. I went intending to just go and chill, walk down the promenade and get a bite to eat. Did all that but being surrounded by couples, families and just general groups of people was difficult to be around. It was a nice day and good to get some sea air in me, but would I do it again... no chance. My favourite bit was probably the long drive!!

Am i doing something wrong or does it get better with time?",0,"the narrative describes an individual's experience of going to the beach alone and finding it challenging. despite the difficulty of being surrounded by groups of people, the individual highlights positive aspects such as enjoying the long drive and the sea air. the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and a willingness to try new things based on positive encouragement from others. the person questions whether the experience will improve over time, indicating an openness to personal growth and adaptation. these elements suggest a temporary struggle rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness, as the individual shows resilience and a proactive approach to managing their social environment."
"In case no one has said this to you today, you're doing your best and you're going to be okay.nan",0,"the narrative expresses a positive and supportive message, suggesting a sense of reassurance and encouragement. the language used is uplifting and empathetic, which often reflects a mindset of someone who is either in a stable emotional state or is actively trying to foster a sense of well-being in others. phrases like ""you are doing your best"" and ""you are going to be okay"" indicate a focus on perseverance and optimism, which are not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. instead, these statements suggest an outward-looking perspective, where the author is engaged in providing comfort rather than seeking it. the overall tone and intent of the message imply a sense of connection and empathy towards others, characteristics that are generally less common in narratives where loneliness is a predominant theme."
"Anyone else just want a really good hug?!Even before social distancing, I always just wanted a hug where the other person genuinely wanted to hug you back. I love giving hugs but unfortunately I don??t really have anyone to give them to!",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical affection and connection, which is a common human need. the individual mentions enjoying giving hugs and feeling a longing for genuine reciprocation, but this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""always"" suggests a long-standing preference for meaningful physical contact rather than a recent development or acute sense of isolation. the narrative lacks indicators of deeper emotional distress or social withdrawal typically associated with loneliness. instead, it reflects a specific, perhaps unmet, desire within the context of a broader social life. the absence of expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or social disconnection further supports the interpretation that this person is not experiencing loneliness."
"(17M) just finished watching an episode of the office where Jim has a party and doesn??t invite michael. I laugh at the show, but I realize that him being knowingly ostracized is basically me. It kind of hurtsnan",0,"the narrative describes a person watching an episode of a popular tv show and relating to one of the characters who is not invited to a party. although the person acknowledges a similarity between their own experiences and the character's situation, they are still able to laugh at the show. this suggests a level of emotional detachment and resilience. the brief mention of feeling hurt by the character's ostracism does not necessarily indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, it seems to be a fleeting recognition of a shared experience rather than a deep-seated emotional state. the ability to enjoy the show and the casual tone of the narrative imply that the person is not deeply affected by loneliness."
Just lost an friendLost another friend. She hates me now telling ne to fuck off. What's nothing to do with me. And i want to die she was my best friend,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author has lost a friend and is experiencing significant distress and emotional turmoil. however, the context and specific examples provided, such as the immediate reaction to the loss and the strong emotional language, suggest that this is more indicative of an acute emotional response rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the feelings of wanting to die and the intense reaction to the friend's hostility are more aligned with the immediate impact of a traumatic interpersonal event rather than the pervasive, long-term feelings of isolation and disconnection that characterize loneliness. while the author is clearly in pain and experiencing a severe emotional crisis, the narrative does not provide evidence of ongoing social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections beyond this particular incident."
"Michel Houellebecq, Whatever??It??s a fact, I mused to myself, that in societies like ours sex truly represents a second system of differentiation, completely independent of money; and as a system of differentiation it functions just as mercilessly.

The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization.


Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It??s what??s known as `the law of the market??. In an economic system where unfair dismissal is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their place. In a sexual system where adultery is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their bed mate. In a totally liberal sexual system certain people have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude. 


Economic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. Sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society.""


That's why you dont have a girlfriend and never will. ????",0,"the narrative delves into the societal constructs of economic and sexual liberalism, drawing parallels between the two as systems of differentiation that produce similar outcomes in terms of inequality and exclusion. it highlights how some individuals thrive within these systems while others are marginalized. the analysis is presented in a detached, almost clinical manner, focusing on broad societal trends rather than personal feelings or experiences. the tone is analytical and philosophical, lacking personal anecdotes or emotional expressions that would typically indicate loneliness. the author's use of third-person perspective and general observations about society suggests a level of detachment from personal involvement, which is not characteristic of someone expressing loneliness. instead, the narrative reads as an intellectual exploration of societal issues, rather than a personal lament about isolation or lack of connection."
"Not lonely, just haven??t got many friends.I??m not exactly lonely but really bored most of the time and want someone to talk to (message I  really don??t like calling or stuff like that) I??m a 17 year old lad from Sheffield, England and am very caring about people/animals I play video games a lot and like making art such as drawing, painting, music and photography and I??m also doing a Health and Social course(lvl1) at college hoping to become an oncology or neurology nurse in the future. I look forward to any DMs or comments and hope to make some friends. :??)",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is engaged in various activities and has a clear set of interests and aspirations. the person expresses a desire for social interaction but specifies a preference for messaging over calling, which indicates a certain level of comfort with virtual communication. despite mentioning not having many friends, the individual does not express feelings of sadness or isolation. instead, they highlight their hobbies, such as video games, art, and music, and their educational goals, which suggest a forward-looking and optimistic mindset. the caring nature towards people and animals, along with the pursuit of a nursing career, reflects a sense of purpose and connection to others. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is not experiencing loneliness but rather seeking to expand their social circle in a specific, non-urgent manner."
Is it just me or...Am I the only one who hate the typical ??Goodmorning have a good day?? texts I get some don??t get those text all but I feel most people don??t care if u have or good day or not it??s just a typical text for them to fake care because they may feel sorry for you it??s hard to know who genuinely cares and who just sends a text just to send one,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of skepticism and frustration towards the superficiality of common social interactions, particularly the ""good morning"" and ""have a good day"" texts. while the individual expresses doubt about the genuineness of these messages, there is no indication of deeper emotional isolation or distress typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on the perceived insincerity of others, suggesting a critical perspective rather than an emotional yearning for connection. the individual's awareness of social niceties and their questioning of others' motives highlight a level of social engagement and discernment. this critical view of social interactions does not inherently imply loneliness but rather a dissatisfaction with the quality of those interactions. thus, the narrative lacks the hallmark signs of loneliness, such as feelings of abandonment, longing for meaningful connections, or a sense of being misunderstood or isolated."
"This is how it isI thought I had friends. At least in high school.  
It was something that I did not realize could be lost. Friendship.  
School and friend was all I had. Even if I wasn't the best friend they could have.  
To be honest I was a bully for some poor kids. I am not proud of it. They grew up to be criminals now.  
I was also a victim of bullying. Only now I realize how bad it was.  
Story short. High school. Best friend and I in same school. Friend has new friends. I'm trashed. I try to be better. Still trashed. And alone till today 6 years later.  
I apologize for my language this is my second.",0,"the narrative reflects a journey through high school experiences with friends, bullying, and self-reflection. the writer recounts having friends during high school, despite not being the best friend themselves and engaging in bullying behavior. they acknowledge the impact of their actions and express regret. the mention of having a best friend who eventually found new friends suggests a period of social transition and loss. however, the writer does not dwell extensively on feelings of loneliness or isolation, focusing instead on their past behavior and the consequences. the narrative indicates a level of self-awareness and personal growth, as the writer attempts to improve themselves and acknowledges their mistakes. while they mention being alone for six years, the overall tone lacks the depth of emotional distress typically associated with profound loneliness. instead, the narrative reads as a reflection on past experiences and a recognition of personal change."
does anybody ever get suicidal because of their looks?[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a question about whether physical appearance can lead to suicidal thoughts, but it does not necessarily indicate the presence of loneliness in the author. the inquiry could stem from curiosity, concern for others, or personal experience with body image issues. while struggles with self-image and mental health are serious, they are not inherently tied to loneliness. loneliness often involves feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, and a longing for meaningful relationships, none of which are explicitly mentioned in the narrative. the focus here is more on the psychological impact of looks rather than on the absence of social bonds or support systems, which are key indicators of loneliness."
"I??m 19F and dude, life is weird and lonelyHuman life has to be the craziest aspect of the universe. Consciences and fantasies and wants and desires and fears. Wtf? It??s also insufferably lonely at times. Curse the human mind for being so intricate and needing other human connection to thrive.

Anyway, does anyone just wanna have a civil chat? Need a distraction and would appreciate a little company (:",0,"the narrative reflects a young individual's philosophical contemplation about the complexities of human existence, touching upon themes of consciousness, desires, and fears. despite the mention of feeling insufferably lonely at times, the tone of the narrative does not convey deep, pervasive loneliness. instead, the author expresses a desire for a civil chat and a distraction, which suggests a proactive approach to seeking social interaction rather than an entrenched sense of isolation. the casual and somewhat upbeat language, including phrases like ""dude, life is weird"" and the smiley face emoticon, indicates a level of resilience and openness to connection. these elements point towards a situational rather than chronic experience of loneliness, where the individual acknowledges occasional loneliness but does not seem overwhelmed by it."
Guys here need to understand. Girls like bad boys and fuckbois. And nice guys finish last.[deleted],0,"the narrative exhibits a focus on generalized statements about gender dynamics and societal perceptions of behavior. it lacks personal introspection or emotional disclosure, which are often indicators of loneliness. instead, the writer appears to be making an external observation rather than expressing feelings of isolation or yearning for connection. the tone is detached and somewhat critical, suggesting a perspective that is more analytical than emotionally driven. the absence of personal anecdotes or expressions of longing for social interaction further supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness. this kind of narrative is more indicative of someone sharing a viewpoint rather than conveying a personal emotional struggle."
Want friends17F lonely just want to find people to talk too just message me,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction and making friends, which is a common human experience. the straightforward and concise nature of the message suggests a proactive approach to finding companionship rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. the use of casual language and the invitation to ""just message me"" implies openness and a readiness to engage with others. while the term ""lonely"" is used, it appears more as a situational feeling rather than a chronic or pervasive state. this indicates a temporary and situational desire for connection rather than a profound sense of loneliness."
"Anybody there?I could use someone to talk to. I should be sleeping now, but I??m wide awake with no one to talk to.",0,"the narrative suggests a momentary desire for conversation rather than a persistent state of loneliness. the individual's request for someone to talk to appears situational, perhaps due to difficulty sleeping, rather than indicative of a deeper, chronic sense of isolation. while they express a need for interaction, it lacks the depth and context typically associated with ongoing loneliness, such as feelings of worthlessness, pervasive sadness, or long-term social disconnection. the absence of these more profound emotional cues suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness in a sustained or significant way. instead, the narrative reflects a transient need for companionship during an unusual waking hour."
Starting to get tired of my family but I have nobody!Family don??t do shit for me and I have nobody else outside of that. They only want to help and support who they want to. Here we go again another New Year??s Eve and I have no one else to celebrate with but family like kids and teens do when they??re not ready to go out and party. But hell even some teens do shit. I can??t believe I??m 28 and never did any adult related New Years or any holiday activities!,0,"the narrative expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the individual's family and social life. while the person feels unsupported and disappointed by their family's selective support, there is no clear indication of deep loneliness. the frustration appears to stem more from unmet expectations and a desire for a different social experience rather than a profound sense of isolation. the comparison to teens and the focus on not having experienced ""adult"" activities suggests a yearning for different social interactions rather than a fundamental lack of connection. thus, the narrative reflects more of a situational dissatisfaction rather than chronic loneliness."
I want to suppress my feeling for an online friendI began to get attached to her and develop feelings I guess because I am alone. How do I suppress these feelings?,0,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with the complexity of emotions tied to an online friendship. the person's desire to suppress their feelings suggests a level of self-awareness and an attempt to manage their emotional state. however, the context of developing feelings due to being alone could be interpreted as a common experience in forming online connections, rather than a definitive indicator of loneliness. the focus on managing emotions and seeking advice on how to suppress feelings indicates a proactive approach rather than one driven by despair or isolation. the narrative lacks explicit expressions of chronic loneliness or a deep sense of social isolation, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a situational challenge that many people face in navigating online relationships and emotional boundaries."
"I want to be alone, but I can??t bear it?[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a conflict between the desire for solitude and the inability to cope with it, which might initially seem like an indicator of loneliness. however, the expression of wanting to be alone can sometimes reflect a need for personal space or time for introspection, rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the inability to bear being alone could indicate a struggle with self-soothing or discomfort with one's own thoughts, but it does not necessarily equate to chronic loneliness. it is important to consider that the person may be experiencing temporary discomfort rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. thus, the narrative points more towards an internal conflict or stress rather than a clear, enduring experience of loneliness."

I'd love to see yall personality types! [Take the test](https://www.16personalities.com/)

it turned out I'm an INFJ-T (Advocate) which's I feel quite accurate.",0,"the narrative exhibits an interest in engaging with others and a proactive approach to self-reflection. the individual initiates a conversation about personality types, indicating a desire for social interaction and shared experiences. their enthusiasm for seeing others' results and their openness about their own personality type suggests a sense of curiosity and connection rather than isolation. the language used, such as ""i'd love to see yall personality types,"" conveys a friendly and inviting tone, which is not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. the act of taking a personality test and sharing the results also reflects self-awareness and a positive engagement with one's identity, further supporting the notion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"If you have the chance to know someone in a romantic way, will you have the courage to do so?I've been in this situation once, but she was ""normal"", she had several partners before. That time I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't be enough for her in any way since I don't have any experience in romantic relationship and sex. Am I the only one that would opt out from this situation?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's introspection and contemplation about romantic relationships, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the person describes a past experience where they felt inadequate due to their lack of romantic and sexual experience compared to a potential partner. this sense of inadequacy and self-doubt is a common emotional response and does not inherently signify loneliness. the individual's query about whether others would make the same choice suggests a desire for social validation and understanding, which is a normal part of human interaction. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation, persistent sadness, or a yearning for social connection, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on personal insecurities and hypothetical social scenarios, which are typical concerns that do not necessarily imply a deeper sense of loneliness."

btw our friendship is fully gone, no point trying to reach out",0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on the loss of a significant friendship due to their own actions, specifically alcohol consumption. while the individual expresses regret and acknowledges their role in the dissolution of the friendship, there is an underlying acceptance of their introverted nature and discomfort with social interactions. the reference to having never found a good connection with people in 18 years suggests a long-standing pattern rather than an acute feeling of loneliness. the narrative lacks expressions of longing for companionship or distress over isolation, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the regret of losing a unique connection without a broader desire for social interaction. this context points to an understanding and acceptance of their introverted lifestyle rather than an experience of loneliness."
"The best of friendsI have real friends. I crack jokes with them during school. Sometimes. Other times they insult me about my disastrous relationship with my ex, which is always nice.

It always feels like each friend would always rather talk to someone other than me. I basically don't exist to them after school. I might get sent a link to a video. If I'm lucky.

Friends that have moved away are much the same. Yeah, invite me to a party, and then leave the party, so another friend can join my party and then leave it to join your party, all so you can play a game that I don't own while I wait a week for about an hour of actually playing a game with you guys before you go play another game I don't have.

I know all my friends are out at each other's houses, watching movies, and doing other stuff while I'm sat here at home with nothing to do and noone to talk to until I get back to school, only for the cycle to repeat. I don't so much as hear about any of this until it's already happened, either.

""Last night Friend and I did this and that."" Oh, really? That's cool. Shame, though, as I never get invited to have fun with you guys after school. 

This all makes me feel... tolerable at best. People can stand being in my presence, especially when they're laughing at my expense (""your ex left you"", ""you'll never have a stable relationship"", ""This is why she left you for Friend""), but they'd rather be rid of me as long as possible. I constantly have this feeling and it's not fun.

Yeah. Yeah, I have friends. Great friends, at that.",0,"the narrative describes a person who interacts with friends at school and engages in activities such as joking around, which indicates social connections. however, the person's experiences with these friends outside of school seem less fulfilling, as they feel excluded from activities and often become the subject of ridicule. while these experiences might cause feelings of frustration and being undervalued, the individual still maintains some level of social interaction and connection, as evidenced by the occasional video links and the parties they are invited to, even if they feel left out. the tone suggests a sense of dissatisfaction with the quality of these friendships rather than a complete absence of social ties, indicating that while the person may experience some social challenges, they are not entirely isolated."
"Drinking Alone as a method of self care.So this is something I??ve been doing since I was 19 (Currently M26 Straight and Canadian). I??ll buy myself my favourite bottle of wine and sometimes some food. Often I put something on Netflix or listen to some tunes and just sit there and let myself feel all the things. Basically allowing myself to be alone and vulnerable for a night here and there. The next morning I always feel refreshed....slightly hungover....but mentally refreshed and relaxed!  

Now I know a lot of people say drinking alone is not good for you and a sign of depression, and while that is something I have been and am dealing with, I personally couldn??t disagree more. I enjoy it, especially after a long hard week. It helps to put things in perspective and reset! 

Does anyone else do this? 
Would you call it Master Dating? (Pun intended)",0,"the narrative describes a personal ritual that involves drinking alone as a form of self-care. the individual shares their enjoyment of this activity, emphasizing how it helps them feel mentally refreshed and relaxed despite the occasional hangover. they acknowledge societal concerns about drinking alone and its potential links to depression but firmly state their disagreement, highlighting their positive experience. the person also mentions dealing with depression, but their tone and description suggest a sense of control and purpose in their actions. they seek to connect with others by asking if anyone else engages in similar activities, indicating a desire for shared experiences rather than expressing feelings of isolation. overall, the narrative portrays a coping mechanism that the individual finds beneficial, showing self-awareness and a proactive approach to managing their mental health."
"Hi there everyone!I'm all open for any concerns, just leave a message and I'll surely give you a reply. I know it's hard sometime, but hey you're one step of progress if you'd reach out. I'm here so that I could at least give out a little helping hand, not a therapist or a hero, just being human perhaps. Have a great day!",0,"the narrative exhibits a warm and inviting tone, suggesting a willingness to connect and support others. phrases like ""i'm all open for any concerns"" and ""just leave a message and i'll surely give you a reply"" indicate an eagerness to engage in social interactions and provide assistance. the writer's acknowledgment of the challenges others might face, coupled with the assurance of a supportive response, reflects empathy and a sense of community. the use of ""have a great day!"" further underscores a positive and outgoing demeanor. these elements are typical indicators of someone who is not experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate social connectedness, proactive communication, and a desire to foster connections with others."
"I'm Done. I'm about to go crazy.I'm a young male with absolutely nothing. I am being evicted and I'm going crazy. I have low functioning depression and I am too numb. I hate my family, former friends and society. I don't know what to do. Nobody will help me or even validate me. Medication doesn't work at all, therapy is a joke and now I feel trapped. I see only disingenuous smiles. I lost school and employment, I'm on disability.

My parents are alcoholics. I'm about to go crazy, I can't see straight anymore. I'm taking these words to the grave. I don't care anymore. Fuck everything. I don't know what to do. I can't even get out of bed sometimes. Please if you see this don't be me. Anybody can have this happen to themselves.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of despair and frustration, with the individual expressing feelings of being overwhelmed by their circumstances. they mention a lack of support from family, friends, and society, which contributes to their feelings of isolation. however, the emphasis on anger and frustration towards external factors, such as their family and societal structures, suggests that their primary struggle is with external adversities rather than an internal sense of loneliness. the narrative also highlights a sense of hopelessness and a lack of effective coping mechanisms, such as medication and therapy, which are common in individuals experiencing severe depression. while the individual feels disconnected and unsupported, the narrative does not convey the typical indicators of loneliness, such as a longing for meaningful connections or a sense of being alone in the world. instead, it focuses more on the external challenges and the individual's struggle to navigate them."
"It's been three yearsSo, it's been three years since I last spoke to my best friend. She is literaly the best person imaginable for me. She is everything I'm not. She was warm and emotional when I was cold and calculated. She brought out the best in me. She made me a better person. Made me want to be a better person. I'm sorry for the cliches, I hate them too but they describe things perfectly. She always helped me and everyone in her life. She is the kindest and most loving person I know. She got me through a lot of stuff, gave me advice and kept me company when noone else would.

We texted and talked everyday, all day, for years and then one day I snapped. 

She was having a tough time trying to date a mutual friend of ours. She was not in her usual happy-for-no-reason mood (which to this day I don't get but still admire). I tried to cheer her up and make her forget about it. A couple of months passed where this kept happening. For some reason, it got in my head, that maybe... well... I'm single, she was single, maybe we could ""mutually serve"" each other. That thought was the worst thing to happen to me till this day. I told her my idea, because naturally... We shared everything... Why wouldn't I? After all it wasn't such a bad idea.... (Idiot!). 

So anyway, she stopped worrying about this guy and then one night we were out for drinks and met up by chance. She was a bit horny lately and we hadn't discussed my idea ever since the first time. Also, earlier that night something happened with him and she was upset. After a few drinks, we were about to call it a night. Out of nowhere she texts me, (because there were other friends present) that maybe we should do ""something"" tonight so she could get her mind off him and also have a good time. Obviously, I agreed and hatched a quick plan to ditch the others and pick her up to go some place quiet.

It probably took 10 minutes to get there. The first 2 where full of excitement. Then it started going down-hill. She started stressing that maybe this would ruin our relationship. Stress turned to heavy anxiety. And by the time I parked the car and we got in the back seats, she was quite nervous to say the least. We started to talk. I didn't want to initiate any physical contact because she had been assaulted once and I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or stress out more. So in the end she talked herself out of it. I couldn't do anything obviously so I just agreed and took her home. She knew I didn't like it but what could I do? She kept apologizing for not following through. I told her not to worry. I'd get over it and everything would back to normal.

(REALLY) Long story short, after that night I was obsessed with the idea of us being together. I told her how I felt. That I loved her. Not just as friends. And that I wanted us to be something more than that.

For two months we only talked about this and that night. We argued a lot. Because she felt guilty. Because she felt responsible for me feeling sad and lonely. She thought that maybe we should cut off all communication until I feel better and forget those feelings. I couldn't do that, I'd go crazy. Finally, I couldn't take it any more and agreed to not speak to her until I felt better. She was sad but also happy because she thought that would work and made me promise that some time soon everything would be back to normal.

To this day we still have not spoken a word and I haven't stopped thinking about this whole thing. She made some attempts to talk to me but I pushed her away every time. During those last months she had found someone else. I tried to be happy for her but I just couldn't hide my envy.

It's been three years since we've spoken and I've lost my best friend and possibly the best person for me to be in a relationship with. I've caught myself multiple times thinking that it's been way way longer. Heck, I had to check my messages on FB to be sure before I post here. And the cherry on top.... I recently found out that she's getting married sometime soon.

By the way I give her 0 blame for all this but God damn! Ain't life a bitch?!",0,"the narrative describes a deep and meaningful relationship that ended abruptly due to unreciprocated romantic feelings. the author expresses regret and sorrow over the loss of this friendship, acknowledging the significant positive impact the friend had on their life. despite the emotional pain and ongoing thoughts about the friend, the narrative lacks the hallmark signs of pervasive loneliness. instead, it focuses on specific events and the emotional aftermath of a failed attempt to transition a friendship into a romantic relationship. the author’s ability to reflect on the situation, recognize their own role in the outcome, and express a desire to move on suggests resilience and emotional processing rather than chronic loneliness. the presence of self-awareness and the ability to find some closure, despite the lingering pain, indicates that the author is not experiencing a profound sense of loneliness, but rather a situational sadness tied to a specific loss."
BoredboredboredboredboredboresAll the time everyday,0,"the narrative reflects a state of boredom rather than loneliness. the repetition of the word ""bored"" emphasizes a lack of stimulation or interest in daily activities, which is a distinct emotional state from loneliness. loneliness typically involves feelings of isolation, a longing for social connection, and emotional pain from perceived social disconnection. in contrast, boredom is characterized by a lack of engagement and a desire for something more stimulating or meaningful to do. the absence of references to social interactions, relationships, or feelings of isolation in the narrative supports the interpretation that the individual is experiencing boredom rather than loneliness."
"Any lonely woman out there that lives near Modesto, CA that wants to hang out sometime and get to know each other, PM me.Just looking for any connection at this point.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire for social interaction and connection, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper sense of loneliness. the request for companionship and the openness to meeting new people suggest a proactive approach to building relationships. the phrase ""just looking for any connection at this point"" might hint at a lack of current social bonds, but it does not convey the emotional distress or pervasive sense of isolation typically associated with loneliness. instead, it suggests a situational need for social engagement rather than an ongoing, profound feeling of loneliness. the narrative's tone is more about seeking opportunities for socialization rather than expressing feelings of emptiness or despair."
Nobody will ever love me[deleted],0,"the narrative presents a brief and intense expression of self-doubt and perceived unworthiness, which can be indicative of a momentary emotional outburst rather than a persistent state of loneliness. the phrase ""nobody will ever love me"" reflects a negative self-assessment and a fear of rejection, but without additional context, it is challenging to determine if this sentiment is part of a deeper, ongoing experience of loneliness. such statements can sometimes emerge from temporary feelings of sadness or frustration rather than chronic isolation. the use of ""[deleted]"" suggests the author might have reconsidered their expression or felt discomfort in sharing, indicating a level of self-awareness and possibly a support system that could provide some level of emotional connection. overall, while the narrative conveys a moment of distress, it lacks sufficient evidence of persistent loneliness, such as prolonged social withdrawal, feelings of emptiness, or a consistent lack of meaningful relationships."
"Christmas bluesSorry if this is difficult to read. I often have trouble putting my thoughts into words and I'm having a lot of thoughts tonight.

I have some really good friends in my life. They've mostly moved away now, but we speak regularly over discord. We don't often speak about ""real"" stuff, but I can turn to them when I need. So in that regard I'm pretty lucky.

But over the holiday season everyone is spending time with family and I feel like I don't have that. My family is just my mom and I. Although we live together I've never felt like we've ever been really connected emotionally like other families are. But that's not the connection I feel like I'm missing at this time of year. I find myself longing for my own person to make my own family with.

I'm a pretty solitary person and I have trouble with both casual socializing (except when it's centered around a set activity) and forming connections with people. For the most part I feel like dating isn't worth the effort. I would have to spend a lot of time dealing with people I don't find interesting to find someone who I can form a connecting with which would be incredibly draining - I have an autoimmune condition and struggle with day to day life already. Even then I haven't had any kind of relationship since high school (26 now) so I'd be way inexperienced. Plus living with my mother is awkward and embarrassing but financially I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future. 

A lot of this sounds like excuses to not put myself out there and maybe it is, but I spend more time content with my situation than not so I'm unlikely to actually do anything about it. In a couple of days I'll probably go back to just carrying on with my life but I'm sad now and felt the inexplicable need to write about it where strangers on the internet who might be feeling the same way can see.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is introspective and aware of their social connections and limitations. they acknowledge having good friends, even if those friends are physically distant, and they maintain regular communication with them. the individual recognizes the emotional gap with their family, particularly with their mother, but does not dwell on it excessively. their longing for a deeper connection and a desire to form their own family is expressed, but it is tempered with a pragmatic view of their current situation and the challenges they face, such as their autoimmune condition and financial constraints. despite moments of sadness and longing, the person seems to accept their circumstances and finds contentment more often than not. this balanced perspective and the ability to find solace in their existing relationships, even if not perfect, are indicators that they are not overwhelmed by loneliness. instead, they exhibit a realistic approach to their social life and future aspirations, suggesting a level of resilience and self-acceptance."

Thanks for listening.",0,"the narrative describes feelings of exclusion and disappointment in a long-term friendship. the individual recounts specific instances where they were not tagged in social media posts and were left out of group plans. despite these concerns, the writer acknowledges their infrequent use of social media, which might contribute to the situation. the narrative also reveals frustration over the friend's inability to remember their consistent days off, suggesting a perceived lack of effort or care from the friend. while these feelings are valid and indicative of interpersonal strain, they do not necessarily point to a broader sense of loneliness. the writer's primary focus is on the dynamics of a specific friendship rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. their engagement in social activities, even if not always included, and their active communication about their feelings indicate they are not experiencing deep loneliness but rather navigating a challenging phase in a close relationship."
"Do I actually have friends?Though I love my friends I just don??t feel as if we are in the same level or even the same world. I just zone out I mean I know I??m here but not actually. It??s weird I know but I haven??t met anyone that has actually been able to connect with me. They only see me as some sort of small child. Of course I appreciate them but they make me feel so bad emotionally ig. Should I just drop them or keep up with their boringness? 

Thanks in advance:)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with feeling out of sync with their friends, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses love and appreciation for their friends, which suggests a sense of connection and affection. while they feel misunderstood and emotionally disconnected at times, these feelings are more indicative of a desire for deeper connections rather than an absence of social ties. the contemplation of whether to drop or continue with their friends shows an active engagement in their social life. the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness, such as a pervasive sense of isolation or an absence of meaningful relationships. instead, it highlights a nuanced emotional experience within existing friendships."
"Seeing happy couples gets me really sadSo I feel sad. A lot of the times, I will be out in the street and I'll see girls and boys or a happy couple etc together all the time having fun and they'll be the same age as me and I can't help but feel a lot of anger inside of me. Or when I see someone with a lot of friends. Like I feel like nobody likes me or something is wrong. 

On YouTube, all the videos that pop up are tiktok pranks of couples getting naked or kissing with each other, but I can't but help to feel really jealous

And worst of all, I'm alone a lot, so in my college it's almost a stigma to not date anyone. 

I have bad confidence about myself. I'm only 16 but my crush doesn't like me, I've never dated. I know people will tell me I'm young and have a lifetime ahead of me to find someone but to me it feels the opposite. I don't think I'll find anyone.",0,"the narrative expresses a significant amount of sadness and frustration, especially when observing happy couples and groups of friends. the individual describes feelings of jealousy and low self-esteem, which are common emotions during adolescence, particularly when faced with social comparisons. the mention of being alone frequently and feeling as though something is wrong with them suggests a sense of social isolation. however, these feelings might be more reflective of the typical struggles of teenage years rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative also touches on the societal pressures of dating and the stigma of being single in college, which can amplify feelings of inadequacy. the individual's belief that they have a lifetime ahead to find someone indicates an underlying awareness of potential future opportunities, despite their current despair. these aspects, while indicative of temporary distress and self-doubt, do not necessarily confirm a deep-seated experience of loneliness."
Scared I won??t ever find something real[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a common concern about finding genuine connections, but it lacks deeper indicators of chronic loneliness. the expression of fear about not finding something real suggests a momentary anxiety rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness often describe a persistent feeling of being disconnected from others, a lack of meaningful relationships, or a sense of emptiness. in this case, the narrative focuses on a specific worry about future relationships rather than an ongoing state of loneliness. the brevity and the specific nature of the concern point more towards a situational apprehension rather than a broader, enduring experience of loneliness."
I hate when I ask dumb stuff.[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a moment of self-criticism and embarrassment, but it lacks deeper indicators of loneliness. feeling frustrated or embarrassed about asking ""dumb stuff"" can be a common experience that many people go through without necessarily feeling isolated or disconnected from others. there is no mention of feelings of social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or prolonged sadness that are typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on a specific, situational emotion that suggests a temporary discomfort rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. this kind of self-critical thought can occur in anyone, regardless of their social support or overall mental state."
"My very vague situation and feelings.This quarantine has halted my already slow and inconvenient life so far and all I can think about is what I want in the future. I don't feel like it's impossible but I'm embarrassed of where I'm coming from and it was never really in my power but I can't help but take ownership. Another thing is my small social life to which I feel no right to share my situation, not because of my relationship to them but how I feel validation is pointless to wellbeing at the moment. In writing this I expect nothing but to relieve some stress before sleep, it would be nice to know I'm not the only one who has experienced this kind of situation. Thank you for reading my nonsensical ranting.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of introspection and contemplation about one's current situation and future aspirations, which is a normal response to the changes brought about by quarantine. the author acknowledges feelings of embarrassment and a desire for ownership over their circumstances, but there is no explicit mention of profound isolation or a deep yearning for social connection. the reference to a ""small social life"" and the lack of perceived need for validation suggests a level of self-sufficiency and acceptance of their social situation. the act of writing to relieve stress and the appreciation for potential shared experiences with others indicate a healthy coping mechanism rather than a cry for help. overall, the narrative demonstrates self-awareness and a balanced approach to their feelings and social interactions, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Sex doesn??t help fill the void.Trading real human interaction and friendships and conversations for meaningless sex with random strangers from tinder doesn??t help.

For a moment, it??ll feel as if I helped someone feel good. I fulfilled a purpose. I did something with someone that felt good and was harmless.

But after it??s done, the experience is done too. The daily messages fade away. The interest evaporates. They disappear, and I??m left empty again.

It??s not their fault for that happening. I mean, most of the time the premise of hook ups is straight forward. They??re always honest. We both look for something from someone.

It??s not about the random men. It??s not about feeling admiration or infatuation for them. It??s about feeling like I mattered enough to get someone??s attention.

But at the end of the day it??s just meaningless sex with meaningless men who??re having sex with a meaningless girl. It never meant anything in the first place.

It gets tiring playing another random girl, ya know? It??s just hard when I get my hopes up because I feel like someone actually likes me. And it??s my own stupid fault.",0,"the narrative describes a pattern of engaging in casual sexual encounters in an attempt to find a sense of purpose and connection. the author acknowledges that these interactions are fleeting and do not provide the lasting fulfillment they seek. despite the temporary satisfaction of feeling desired, the author ultimately feels empty and disappointed. this cycle of hope and subsequent emptiness is a clear indicator of an underlying struggle with self-worth and the search for meaningful human connection. the narrative highlights the futility of using superficial interactions to fill a deeper emotional void, and the author’s awareness of this dynamic suggests a recognition of the need for more substantial relationships."
"A Menacing DawnIt??s difficult to love. Love itself is adventitious I think. Similar to stalagmite formations in a dank cave or even the tumble of a bumble bee in morning pollen. It hurts so so much though when there??s no answer back in the beam of your love. Love is an effort. To love yourself and then bridge it onto other people. Shoot, even to love something be it music, film, architecture, etc etc is a perpetual effort due to how adventitious the draw of a camera shot or melody might be for you. Same goes for relationships with people. 

Because of its?? unexpectedness, I think love is ultimately an effort in venturing into the unknown and being open in the loneliness that??s prior to all love. For I think love is a formation of something between one thing and others. To be lonely is necessary for transcendence. But to be open in that void of loneliness is the true catalyst for the transformation love brings forth. At least I feel so.


I??m in my feels tonight for reasons I??ve cried too much over, but I??m hoping this tidbit of writing does something for someone. Please take care of yourself.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep contemplation on the nature of love and its inherent challenges. the author uses vivid metaphors, such as stalagmite formations and the tumble of a bumblebee, to illustrate the adventitious and often unpredictable nature of love. while the narrative acknowledges the pain and effort involved in loving oneself and others, it ultimately presents loneliness as a necessary precursor to love, framing it as a transformative experience rather than a purely negative state. the author’s reflections suggest a level of self-awareness and acceptance of loneliness as part of the human experience, indicating an understanding and integration of these feelings rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation. the narrative concludes with a hopeful message, encouraging self-care, which further suggests a balanced perspective rather than one dominated by loneliness."
I crave warmthThat's it. That's the post.,0,"the narrative expresses a simple desire for warmth, which can be interpreted in various ways, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the brevity and lack of detail in the statement suggest that the author is making a straightforward comment rather than delving into deeper emotional states. craving warmth can be a basic physical need or a metaphorical longing for comfort, which does not inherently point to feelings of loneliness. without additional context or more elaborate expressions of emotional isolation, it is difficult to conclude that the author is experiencing loneliness. the directness and minimalism of the narrative suggest a more immediate, possibly situational desire rather than an ongoing emotional struggle."
"Almost feel like quitting.. lifeFeels like I??m only doing worse everyday. 

There is no love life - I??m too pessimistic about every guy - either he is an asshole or he is too nice.

I have decided to not talk to friends anymore because I think they do not care.

I used to workout and that would make me feel good but nowadays that does not help too.

Other than my parents, I feel there is no purpose for me living anymore.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of dissatisfaction and frustration with various aspects of life, including work, relationships, and personal fulfillment. the individual mentions feeling pessimistic about potential romantic partners and perceives a lack of recognition at work. they also express a belief that their friends do not care, leading to a decision to stop communicating with them. despite these struggles, the individual continues to find some sense of purpose through their relationship with their parents. while these feelings are significant and suggest a state of distress, the presence of a support system in the form of their parents and the fact that they previously found joy in activities like working out indicates that the individual is experiencing a period of difficulty rather than profound loneliness. the narrative suggests a need for support and possible intervention to address these challenges and improve their overall well-being."
"Sad, lonely and emptyThe loneliness is crushing. I feel like no one cares. I??m insignificant. I just feel like an outsider, existing but not living, not actually participating in life. I just want to feel like a person who matters.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of emotional pain and isolation, with the individual describing feelings of being insignificant and an outsider. these are classic indicators of loneliness, as the person feels disconnected from others and unable to participate meaningfully in life. the use of words like ""crushing,"" ""empty,"" and ""insignificant"" highlight the intensity of their emotions. the desire to feel like a person who matters underscores a fundamental human need for connection and validation. despite the apparent depth of loneliness conveyed in the narrative, it is crucial to consider that such expressions can sometimes reflect temporary states or other underlying issues rather than chronic loneliness. the context and specific language used suggest a profound struggle with feelings of loneliness and a yearning for meaningful interpersonal connections."

F27 uk- would be nice if someone would talkFind it hard without many friends. I get lonely especially on evenings. Struggling with mental health also. Hoping there might be some like-minded people to chat with. Maybe anyone who is struggling at the minute?,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is expressing a desire for social interaction and acknowledging a struggle with mental health, which can be common in many people regardless of their loneliness status. the person mentions finding it hard without many friends and feeling lonely in the evenings, which are typical experiences that might suggest loneliness. however, the tone and content indicate a proactive approach in seeking out like-minded individuals and support, suggesting resilience and an active effort to mitigate feelings of isolation. this proactive stance and the hope for connection can be indicative of someone who is managing their social needs effectively, rather than succumbing to chronic loneliness. the mention of struggling with mental health also broadens the context beyond loneliness, highlighting a multifaceted experience that is not solely defined by a lack of social connections."
Merry Christmas!I hope everyone??s having a great holiday season! Much love to all of you &lt;3,0,"the narrative expresses a positive and cheerful sentiment, indicative of someone who is engaged and connected with others. phrases like ""merry christmas"" and ""hope everyone’s having a great holiday season"" suggest a sense of inclusivity and community. the use of exclamation marks and the heart symbol further convey warmth and affection. these elements collectively reflect a person who is likely socially integrated and emotionally content, rather than experiencing loneliness. the overall tone is one of reaching out and sharing joy, which contrasts with the typical indicators of loneliness such as isolation, sadness, or a lack of social interaction."
"The Red Threads Of FateThe red threads of fate are invisible threads that connect two people who are destined to be together. The red thread is attached to the ring finger. The red thread connect two people that will be in true love. I wish i could see this red thread because it seems like the thread snapped. Im not destined to be with anyone. Im destined to die alone.

I don??t know what makes love, love. I don??t know if i love someone or if someone loves me. I can??t tell.",0,"the narrative explores the concept of the red threads of fate, which are believed to connect people destined to be together. the writer expresses a longing to see these threads, indicating a desire for a destined connection and true love. they mention feeling as though their thread has snapped, suggesting a belief that they are not meant to be with anyone. despite this, the narrative lacks explicit expressions of deep-seated loneliness. the writer's reflections on love, while indicating confusion and a sense of deprivation, do not convey an overwhelming sense of isolation or despair typically associated with profound loneliness. instead, the narrative seems more focused on the philosophical and existential musings about love and destiny rather than an acute personal experience of loneliness."
Being together[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of connection and companionship. phrases like ""being together"" imply the presence of others and shared experiences, which are typically indicative of social engagement and support. the absence of language that reflects isolation, longing for interaction, or feelings of being misunderstood supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. psychological insights highlight that individuals who describe their interactions positively and emphasize togetherness are generally less likely to feel lonely. this narrative aligns with such indicators, suggesting a well-integrated social life and emotional fulfillment through relationships."
Looking to blow off steamDon't want to vent but want to blow some steam. Let me know if you're willing to listen,0,"the narrative reflects a desire to release built-up tension or frustration rather than seeking deep emotional connection or expressing feelings of isolation. the author specifically mentions a need to ""blow off steam,"" which suggests a temporary need for stress relief rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the phrase ""don't want to vent but want to blow some steam"" indicates that the individual is not looking for a sympathetic ear or emotional support but rather a quick and perhaps casual interaction to alleviate stress. the request for someone willing to listen further supports the idea that the author is seeking a practical outlet rather than a meaningful connection, which is less characteristic of loneliness. this emphasis on a need for immediate relief rather than long-term emotional support aligns more with non-loneliness."
"LostI??ve never been this lonely before, it??s gotten to the point that I??ve been writing my final letters to people in my head. Would it be best to physically write them out so that it??s not constantly replaying in my head?",0,"the narrative discusses feelings of intense loneliness and mentions the contemplation of writing final letters, which is a significant indication of emotional distress. however, the label suggests that despite these expressions, there might be other factors or context not present in the narrative that indicate the individual is not experiencing loneliness to a clinical degree. it's possible that the narrative reflects a momentary or situational feeling rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the act of questioning whether to write out thoughts may also suggest a level of self-awareness and a potential for seeking solutions or help, which could be indicative of resilience or an underlying support system. the use of phrases like ""never been this lonely before"" might point to an unusual or temporary situation rather than a pervasive sense of isolation."
"It's so hard to find people that clickIt's kinda stupid. I had a small argument not that long ago with the only 2 friends nearby that I have. It was during a board game. It didnt escalate that big and I apologized, but it's kind of a microcosm of the problems I'm having right now with friends. 

I don't feel like I have real friends I can talk with freely and feel totally comfortable with. This group can have its frustrations where I feel like I need to be on my toes to deflect verbal attacks or annoying things they force on you lest I become somewhat of a punching bag. And this just gets amplified in this competitive board game scenario. Sly comments build up and people take sides against you and comments start flying back and forth and it becomes bigger than it should and I even start to annoy myself with how much I'm talking back, at which point things get turned on me for being difficult despite what everyone's said collectively. And I probably was. But it just brings back into full force how toxic these situations feel and the type of relationships I wish I had instead.

And then I go home alone and have nothing but this residual frustrated feeling that if I really let sink in might make cry.

I've had rare people in the past I've known where we could just chat about whatever as time flew by and there was great chemistry and comfort with each other. But ultimately I've lost out on those people as they move forward with life and I'm stuck back at square one.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing conflict and frustration with their current social group, feeling uncomfortable and on edge during interactions. despite these negative experiences, the person reflects on past relationships where they felt a deeper connection and comfort. the longing for more meaningful connections and the discomfort in current friendships highlight dissatisfaction, but the narrative also shows an awareness of what positive relationships feel like. the person's ability to reflect on past positive experiences and desire for better relationships suggests a level of social awareness and hope, which can indicate a temporary struggle rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the presence of some social interactions, even if problematic, and the person's active engagement in trying to resolve conflicts also point to the potential for improved social connections in the future."

Need a hugCrying rn because I don??t have anyone to vent to. Some virtual hugs will do,0,"the narrative expresses a momentary need for comfort and emotional support, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the author specifically mentions crying and the desire for a hug, which are natural responses to stress or sadness. however, the mention of ""virtual hugs"" suggests an awareness of and engagement with an online community, indicating the presence of some form of social support. while the author feels the immediate absence of someone to vent to, this does not imply a chronic lack of meaningful connections. the expression of a temporary emotional state rather than a persistent feeling of isolation aligns with the classification."
"if you are feeling lonely or absent in life do this:read the quran.

the woman who i loved had left me and i was in a state of confusion and great loneliness. i took the book out and gave it a bash. i finished it and now i feel so much better. ofcourse i might be saying this because im muslim but it helped me and i pray it helps others too",0,"the narrative describes a person who initially experienced feelings of loneliness and confusion after a significant personal loss, which is evident in the mention of the woman they loved leaving them. however, the narrative shifts to a positive resolution where the individual finds solace and improved well-being through reading the quran. the person explicitly states that they feel much better after this experience. this resolution and the positive outcome suggest that the individual has successfully managed their feelings of loneliness and found a coping mechanism that works for them. the mention of feeling better and the hope that others might find similar relief indicates a state of improved mental health and a move away from loneliness. thus, the narrative reflects a journey from loneliness to a state of emotional recovery and well-being."
Let your smile change the world but don??t let the world change your smile ????nan,0,"the narrative reflects a positive and resilient outlook, encouraging individuals to maintain their inner happiness and not let external circumstances diminish their joy. this mindset suggests a sense of emotional stability and self-assurance, which are generally inconsistent with feelings of loneliness. the use of motivational language and the focus on maintaining a smile despite challenges indicate an underlying sense of contentment and social connectedness. such expressions typically emerge from a place of internal strength and support, suggesting the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"Excluded in work SnapChats always have me blue??I am a 32 year old male so this may seem funny and/or sad to some lol. So, my then girlfriend (fianc?? now) and I have been working at the same place for years now. I became a Food Service Manager (I work in a grocery store with a buffet style food court). I was told I should not be in group chats with my employees. I am friends with nearly all my staff that work in the kitchen area with me. 

Anyways, they all have multiple SnapChat groups with different food departments (we have American, Chinese, Sushi, Italian) and I am not in one single one. Now, I know I was told to not be in group chats just in case something happens; because as a manager, I would be in a lot more trouble. My fianc?? is a regular, full-time employee. She is in a couple of group chats. I have all the people she talks to on SnapChat and we are all mutual friends??however, when I see them blowing up their group chats and not sending me anything, it makes me upset and want to avoid them. I??ve talked to my fianc?? about it but I always say: ??I know I??m not suppose to be in them but I feel very excluded??. She understands.

Still??the feeling of exclusion just kills me inside. I feel completely alone. Then, this feeling manifests into feeling excluded from everything else. How can I stop feeling like this?!

Bonus points if you can guess where I work!",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual feels excluded from social interactions at work due to professional boundaries. despite understanding the reasons for these boundaries, the person still experiences feelings of exclusion, particularly because their fiancée, who works in the same place, is included in these group chats. the narrative reflects a struggle with balancing professional responsibilities and personal emotions. however, the individual's awareness of the professional rationale behind the exclusion and their proactive communication with their fiancée about these feelings suggest a level of social support and coping mechanisms. the person’s emotional response, while valid, does not seem to stem from a deeper sense of pervasive loneliness but rather from a situational and understandable reaction to a specific professional constraint. their ability to discuss their feelings and recognize the reasons behind the exclusion points to a healthy processing of the situation, rather than an overarching experience of loneliness."
"Having an existential crisis, might delete my life later.nan",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of existential crisis, which can be a profound psychological experience often characterized by questioning the meaning and purpose of life. while this state can be deeply distressing, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. existential crises can occur independently of one's social connections and support systems. the absence of references to social isolation, lack of companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that the individual's distress may stem more from internal philosophical or existential concerns rather than loneliness. the focus on contemplating the value and direction of their life, without mentioning a longing for social interaction or the pain of being alone, supports the classification."
"Before the pandemic I used to think my desire for total self-reliance was just spite from chronic loneliness...Now I'm seeing that it can, in reality, be a necessity, so I think it's time I doubled down on eliminating reliance on others. I'm just not sure where to start. I intend to learn basic levels of carpentry, electrical engineering, botany, chemistry, structural engineering, mechanics, metalworking, tailoring, and programming, but so far I've only got the programming sorted.

I know it's all a bit extreme, but even if I eventually isolate from society, I've always wanted to have these practical skills. Any suggestions on where to start? Quarantine starts in 28 hours, so I've got lots of time to practice.",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is proactively seeking self-reliance rather than expressing feelings of loneliness. the person acknowledges a past perception of loneliness but reframes it as a practical need for independence, especially in light of the pandemic. their detailed plan to acquire various skills indicates a focus on self-improvement and productivity. the tone is more about taking control and preparing for isolation in a constructive manner, rather than lamenting a lack of social connection. this proactive and forward-thinking approach, coupled with a clear action plan and enthusiasm for learning, aligns more with someone who is not experiencing loneliness but rather embracing solitude as an opportunity for growth."

"So used to being by myself, hanging out with anyone feels wrong.[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a level of comfort and habituation with solitude rather than loneliness. the phrase ""so used to being by myself"" indicates that the individual has adapted to and possibly even prefers their own company. this adaptation can be a sign of self-sufficiency and contentment in solitude. the discomfort expressed in ""hanging out with anyone feels wrong"" may point to a personal preference for solitude rather than a feeling of isolation or longing for social connection. it is important to distinguish between solitude and loneliness; solitude is a chosen state where one can feel fulfilled, while loneliness is an unwanted state of isolation. the narrative lacks expressions of sadness, longing, or distress typically associated with loneliness, reinforcing the idea that the individual is not experiencing loneliness but rather has embraced solitude as a preferred lifestyle."
"I wish no one would have the same pain that I??ve hadMy life is full of being teased and blocked, ghosted, humiliated, pressed by others. My mind is so weak to bear all of these.

It??s just too hard and painful. I wish everyone in this sub will be cured soon...",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of distress and emotional pain. the author describes experiences of being teased, ghosted, and humiliated, which have led to significant stress and self-harm behaviors. these elements indicate a struggle with self-worth and a desire for relief from their suffering. the mention of controlling oneself from committing harmful acts highlights the intensity of their emotional turmoil. despite these feelings, the author expresses a wish for others to be cured, suggesting a level of empathy and connection to a community. while the narrative reveals severe emotional challenges, the presence of empathy and concern for others may indicate an underlying connection to a support network, which can be a mitigating factor against feelings of loneliness."
"Why do I constantly feel the need to be in love with someone?No matter how hard I try and get it out of my mind it always bounces back twice as strong.

I miss the feeling of being in love but life doesn??t want that for me. No matter how I try and be myself no one wants to be around me. I just miss the gentle touch of a gf??s hand........",0,"the narrative expresses a deep yearning for romantic connection and physical affection, highlighting the individual's desire for love and companionship. phrases like ""i miss the feeling of holding someone’s hand"" and ""the hugs and kisses while watching movies together"" indicate a longing for intimate experiences. the repetition of ""i miss"" underscores a sense of nostalgia and a strong emotional response to past relationships. however, the narrative also suggests an awareness of personal agency, with the individual actively trying to move past these feelings despite their persistence. the mention of ""no matter how i try and be myself no one wants to be around me"" reflects a perceived social rejection, which could contribute to feelings of loneliness. yet, the focus remains on the specific desire for romantic love rather than a broader sense of isolation, which may differentiate this from more generalized experiences of loneliness."
Meet me and give me all your cashhttps://i.imgur.com/POWz04M_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium,0,"the narrative presents a demand for money without any context or emotional content. it lacks personal details, expressions of feelings, or any indication of a desire for connection. typical indicators of loneliness often include expressions of sadness, longing for companionship, or descriptions of social isolation. this narrative, however, is devoid of such elements and instead focuses solely on a transactional request. the absence of emotional depth or relational context suggests that the author is not experiencing loneliness, as there is no evident desire for social interaction or connection. the straightforward and impersonal nature of the message further supports this assessment."
Anyone from ohio?Northeast Ohio anyone? I wanna hang out,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the person is reaching out to connect with others in their area, which is a common social behavior and not inherently a sign of loneliness. the use of casual language and the straightforward request for companionship imply a proactive approach to meeting new people, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or distress. there is no mention of emotional pain, sadness, or a sense of being disconnected from others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative reflects a normal, healthy effort to expand one's social circle."
"THAT day is tomorrow.Tomorrow is the one day I actually hate couples. It??s not hatred, I??m just jealous they have someone in their lives.",0,"the narrative expresses a temporary and situational feeling of jealousy towards couples, particularly in the context of an upcoming day that likely emphasizes romantic relationships. this sentiment is not indicative of chronic loneliness but rather a common emotional response to specific social situations. the individual acknowledges their jealousy but does not express an ongoing sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections. this suggests that their feelings are more about momentary dissatisfaction rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the absence of language indicating long-term loneliness, such as descriptions of enduring isolation or a persistent lack of social support, further supports this interpretation."

I don't get it. It seems I'm the only person who has had ZERO successes in interaction whatsoever. I have absolutely no friends. I've never had a girlfriend. I don't understand what's wrong with me.

I don't have any hobbies, so it's hard to find people. And even when I start talking to people, they don't stay. I don't belong here and am slowly drifting away from the idea of carrying on. I'm depressed. It's not fair that this is the experience I have.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and self-perceived failure, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions having no friends or romantic relationships, which are crucial elements for social connectedness and emotional support. the lack of hobbies further exacerbates their difficulty in forming connections, as hobbies often provide a common ground for interaction. the comparison with others who have friends or relationships intensifies their feelings of exclusion and inadequacy. the phrase ""i do not belong here"" and the mention of drifting away suggest a profound sense of detachment and hopelessness, typical of someone experiencing loneliness. the narrative also highlights a lack of self-worth and an ongoing struggle with depression, both of which are commonly associated with chronic loneliness."

# Feeling pretty down about my (male 27) female 27 friendship

Don't have many friends these days or ever had (real friends most of my life) but this was different, we had similar beliefs etc, didn't like going to clubs, agreed its hard to make true friends, slowly but surely we got to know each other, we chatted everyday... it was nice to have someone to talk to then it slowly faded to a weekly thing which I was ok with because I know people get busy and people have/need boundaries. We talked about dreams etc, I felt connected, I like deep connections having those make small talk easier down the road as well because we had those kind of talks as that's just the way I am it felt nice someone cared. We agreed its hard to make good friends here. She's Irish and me Canadian as we were just talking about how its hard to make good friends here (in Canada), and sharing fun tidbits about each other's culture. As I said before we slowly got to know each other over 8 months.

Started to ignore my texts didn't want to be pessimistic anymore, so I thought she was busy, then 3-4 weeks go by so i text her to get answer/closure. She answered she said she after she went on her trip (she mentioned this) she went hiking, she didn't touch her phone much then got crazy busy with school and work. Then her ex came back into picture as she ran into them, they started talking and she decided she wants to give it her all again because she really loves him even though she tells me it might not work out again,saying the idea was dumb thats why she didn't tell me(obviously conflicted) She told me she told him that she wouldn't talk/text anyone else and that she felt bad that she let so much time go by and that she should of told me but didn't and that she did see me like a good friend and glad to know me and that she was truely sorry and sorry for being a bitch even though it means nothing now.

She wants to see if they have something worth fighting for.

I know thats the risk for female friendships but didn't expect it to abruptly end like that

All I said is I''m not happy about this but hope your dream works out.

Feel like she didn't value the friendsship,

even though she said she really did enjoy getting to know me

The thing is I told myself I would never beg again for friends or anything(disgusting I know, but thats what happens when you been alone for so long you lose self respect i mean I lasted 6 years though lol)

Keep telling myself this pain is less then the pain of losing yourself respect If i let her back in if it doesn't work... I feel like even it might of even been the boyfriend but if it was her that said she wouldnt talk to anyone she doesn't really value the friendship.

The stupid things people do for love huh?

well its been 24 hours... hopefully I can move on quick

but the problem is I care I remember every little tidbit because I care maybe I care too much.

I just like being there for people, I wish people were there for me

never burnt the bridge but maybe its time for me to burn the bridge and do whats for best for me as well

"""No one owes you a relationship""I mean I think the people who use this sentence when someone complains about their loneliness, they are hedonist and they enjoy others suffering.

There are lots of people who enjoy making people more sad when they already in pain.",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and resentment towards those who dismiss the speaker's feelings of loneliness by saying ""no one owes you a relationship."" the author argues that such responses are insensitive and exacerbate their emotional pain. while the narrative contains elements of emotional distress and criticism of societal attitudes towards loneliness, it does not explicitly convey a sense of personal loneliness. instead, it focuses on the perceived cruelty of others and the unfairness of dismissive remarks. the author's tone is more combative and indignant rather than introspective or self-reflective, which are more common indicators of loneliness. the primary concern seems to be with the attitudes of others rather than an internal struggle with loneliness itself."
I need help[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a plea for help, but it lacks depth and context that would typically indicate loneliness. usually, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include detailed descriptions of feelings of isolation, disconnection from others, or a sense of being misunderstood. the brevity and lack of specific emotional content in this statement do not provide enough evidence to suggest the author is experiencing loneliness. instead, it could indicate a variety of other issues or needs that are not necessarily related to feelings of loneliness. the absence of typical loneliness indicators, such as detailed emotional distress or a sense of prolonged social isolation, supports this assessment."

My cousin was like this too. He would spent time with anyone who would take him to parties and stuff. Even if he didn't really like that person. 

This is so sad. For them... not for me. This time i feel like i'm the one who's taking the right path. For the first time i'm glad to be alone.",0,"the narrative reveals a shift in perspective where the individual recognizes that their feelings of loneliness were tied to a misconception about social interactions. they express a newfound understanding that being selective about their social connections does not equate to loneliness. the person observes that others may engage in social activities out of a sense of desperation rather than genuine connection, and contrasts this with their own situation, which they now view positively. the realization that they are content with their choices and no longer feel the need to participate in superficial social gatherings suggests a sense of self-assurance and fulfillment. this narrative indicates a person who has moved beyond loneliness by embracing solitude as a conscious and satisfying choice, rather than a condition imposed by external circumstances."

Well, I'm here because, like you all, I am lonely. I am also here because I want to share some realizations I have had and hopefully help the discourse here.

I recently learned of the meme term ""COPE"", in that sort of *""I'm avoiding facing something so I will hype myself up""* manner.

I just now realized I have been doing this my whole life.

I keep telling myself self-improvement, hobbies, going to the gym (!), make money man, focus only on you, is the path to not worry about loneliness. This is simply a fairy tale we adults believe. No less pathetic as so many other superstitions we have to soothe ourselves.

It is an avoidant tactic we (especially men) utilize to not face our echoing isolation.

I'm especially guilty of always being on my grind, working excessively (workaholic), but really, it is just to escape the excess time in my own thoughts, away from distractions that would force me to come to terms with the emptiness I feel.

Workaholism is just a way for me to avoid facing my loneliness. 

I also posit that for a large portion of occurrences, in our modern society (in personal relationships), ""takers"" are incentivized, and ""givers"" are punished. To go along with this, more often than not, ""extroverts"" are also celebrated, and ""introverts"" are maligned. 

I think this indirectly, contributes to our collective atomization. 

Humans are social creatures, and like our mammalian friends wolves, we cannot survive outside society alone for long. Our mental, spiritual, and physical survival depends on us not being so alone.

We need others, and we need to be needed by others.

I must confess I do not fear my death. I fear dying without knowing what love feels like.

This is a wound that never heals and a suffering I feel constantly. No amount of distraction is enough anymore.

I need to know what love is.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep self-awareness and introspection about the author's feelings and behaviors. they discuss the masks they wear and the lies they tell themselves, recognizing their own avoidant tactics and workaholism as ways to escape loneliness. they express a desire to contribute to discussions about loneliness and share their realizations with others. despite acknowledging their loneliness and the societal factors that contribute to it, there is an underlying sense of resilience and a proactive approach to addressing their feelings. the narrative highlights the importance of social connections and the human need for love and companionship, but it also shows a level of insight and a willingness to confront these issues head-on, which may indicate a healthier coping mechanism and a stronger sense of self-awareness."
Im stuck. First post ever.[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of being stuck, but it does not provide enough context or emotional depth to indicate loneliness. the brevity and lack of detail in the message could imply that the author is seeking help or advice on a specific issue rather than expressing feelings of isolation. the absence of any mention of social connections, emotional distress, or longing for companionship further supports this interpretation. while feeling stuck can be a component of loneliness, it is not a definitive indicator on its own. without additional information about the author's emotional state or social interactions, it is more likely that this narrative reflects a situational challenge rather than an underlying sense of loneliness."

My parents are extremely busy and I only have a few friends.i always make them laugh but they barely try to make me laugh. Can I have some help hiding my sadness?,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing some dissatisfaction with their social interactions but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. they mention receiving notifications from snapchat, which implies some level of social engagement, even if it is not deeply fulfilling. the individual also states they have a few friends and are capable of making them laugh, indicating they have social connections and the ability to interact positively with others. while they express a desire for reciprocity in their friendships and mention their parents being busy, these points reflect a common desire for more meaningful interactions rather than a profound sense of isolation. the request for help hiding sadness suggests a struggle with emotional expression rather than a complete lack of social support. overall, the narrative lacks the deep sense of disconnection and isolation that are more definitive indicators of loneliness."
A new subreddit some of you might want to check outr/breakingthestigma is a subreddit about helping people become more comfortable talking about mental health. I think some of you would like to check it out if you are struggling. I hope this follows the rules,0,"the narrative suggests a proactive and community-oriented mindset, as the author is promoting a resource that aims to help people become more comfortable discussing mental health issues. this indicates a level of social engagement and concern for the well-being of others, which are generally not typical of individuals experiencing loneliness. the author’s use of inclusive language, such as ""some of you might want to check out"" and ""i think some of you would like to check it out,"" implies they feel part of a community and are motivated to share helpful information. additionally, the tone is supportive and encouraging, which contrasts with the often inward-focused and isolated tone found in narratives from those experiencing loneliness. the intent to follow rules also reflects a desire to maintain positive social interactions and a sense of belonging within a group."

This is the last one. I??m just saying goodbyes and then counting[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a sense of finality and closure, as the individual mentions saying goodbyes and counting something. however, there is no explicit mention of feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the brevity and directness of the statement suggest a matter-of-fact tone rather than an expression of longing for companionship or sadness about being alone. without further context, it appears the person is simply concluding an activity or phase, rather than expressing loneliness. the absence of emotional cues and social context typically linked to loneliness supports the classification."

-My parents never gave me the loving that I needed growing up. It's weird, I know they care, they're just lazy.
-My parents would always smoke in the house and in the car with no regard to me. This lead to me more than likely not having any friends because I always stunk. Never knew I did either until high school when a teacher pointed it out. Then I was severely self conscious about it afterwards.
-I wanted to quit football my freshmen year of high school because I sucked and I knew it. That, and my coach was an asshole to me. Picked on me just because he knew he could. One day at practice I looked away literally for one second (I have ADHD, this is common for me) and I look back as a football he threw at me hit me in the head (I was wearing a helmet, thankfully). He laughed then told me to pay attention.
-I ended up playing out that freshmen season (spent half of it ineligible due to grades) and then quit after the season. I didn't play football my sophomore year and the vibe from my Dad I sure felt. Felt like he hated me until I decided towards the end of sophomore year I'd play again all for a cheap hug.
-Even before high school I had an interest in wanting to learn how to cook (this was before YouTube) and I'd always ask my Mom if she'd show me and I just kept being put off over, and over and over again. I learned how to grill grilled cheeses in middle school and I had so much fun cooking that I kept doing it very often. I guess they never got the hint, or cared.
-I've hardly had very many girlfriends and the last one I had, 9 years ago, broke up with me after I told her I loved her. I had no clue she wasn't interested anymore either so this all came as a shock.
-I became a Christian in my early 20's and I'm sure somehow that has confused and fucked me up even more today than I know with all the rules and whatever. Also, the church people I've come across (this isn't speaking about all) are mostly judgmental, stuck up, money hungry assholes.

I just want to be good enough for someone to love.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-doubt and frustration regarding romantic relationships. the author expresses feelings of inadequacy and a desire for love, which are common emotions during young adulthood, especially when facing challenges in dating. however, these feelings do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual seems to be grappling with self-esteem issues and the normal ups and downs of dating life. while they mention not feeling a connection with anyone and a heartbreak over this, the narrative lacks the pervasive sense of isolation and emotional emptiness that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, the focus is on a specific area of life—romantic relationships—rather than a broader, more generalized feeling of being alone or disconnected from others in various aspects of life."
All I need is a little bit of loveIs it too much to ask for?,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for love, which is a common human need and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""is it too much to ask for?"" suggests a longing or wish for affection, but it doesn't provide enough context to conclude that the individual is experiencing loneliness. the absence of specific references to isolation, feelings of emptiness, or lack of social connections makes it less likely that the person is lonely. instead, it appears to be a general yearning for love, which can be felt by anyone regardless of their social situation."

"I really do...I always try to be normal, and have a normal life, but i fail...I keep failing, so i'll stop now;",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with achieving a sense of normalcy and repeated failures in their attempts. while the tone suggests frustration and resignation, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the expression of giving up on trying to be normal can be associated with feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt rather than isolation. the absence of references to social disconnection, lack of meaningful relationships, or feelings of being alone suggests that the primary issue here may be related to self-perception and personal goals rather than loneliness. the focus on personal failure rather than social exclusion is a key indicator that loneliness is not the central theme of this narrative."

im feeling so fucked upanyone wanna talk,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of emotional distress and a desire for connection, but it doesn't necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. the use of strong language suggests a high level of immediate frustration or anger, which can occur in various emotional states, not exclusively loneliness. the direct request for someone to talk to implies the individual is seeking immediate social interaction, which is a healthy coping mechanism and shows they believe there is someone out there who can provide support. this contrasts with typical indicators of loneliness, where individuals often feel isolated and doubt the availability of supportive relationships. overall, the context suggests a temporary emotional struggle rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
Am I depressed?[removed],0,"the narrative does not present typical indicators of loneliness. while the author expresses concern about potential depression, there is no mention of feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a sense of disconnection from others, which are common signs of loneliness. instead, the focus seems to be more on internal emotional struggles rather than interpersonal ones. the absence of references to a lack of companionship or support suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness. psychological insights indicate that loneliness often involves a perceived gap between desired and actual social relationships, which is not evident in this narrative. therefore, the context and examples provided do not align with the typical profile of someone experiencing loneliness."

"Worst birthday everSo today is my birthday, and my dog that I've had for 7 years got hit by a car, not to mention my best and only friend stopped being my friend today,  plus on top of all of that we have to move tomorrow :/",0,"the narrative describes a series of unfortunate events that occurred on the author's birthday, including the loss of a pet, the end of a friendship, and an impending move. while these events are undoubtedly distressing and would naturally cause emotional pain, they do not inherently suggest a pervasive sense of loneliness. the mention of a best and only friend indicates that the author had at least one close relationship, which implies some level of social connection. the focus of the narrative is on the immediate situational hardships rather than a chronic or deep-seated feeling of isolation. therefore, the distress appears to be more situational and circumstantial rather than indicative of an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"I miss what our friendship was like in the past.you were the only person who made me feel safe to say anything. We talked almost every day, and now we're practically strangers to each other. I feel that I am no longer important in your life, and now I feel more alone than ever. Life sucks.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of loss and nostalgia for a past friendship, indicating a longing for connection and emotional safety that was once present. the writer mentions missing the daily conversations and the comfort they found in the relationship, which has now deteriorated to the point where they feel like strangers. while these feelings might suggest loneliness, the narrative could also be interpreted as a natural response to the end of a meaningful relationship rather than a broader, pervasive sense of loneliness. the expression of sadness and frustration might be more about the specific loss of this friendship rather than an overall state of loneliness."
"[EU] Let's meet up?Hey, Already posted this once but i wonder if more people want to participate. I'm planning on doing a longg hitchhiking trip soon in most country in Europe. Does anyone wanna meet anywhere, for a simple hi, a drink, idk?

If you are introverted, shy, depressed or with social anxiety etc... So am i, let's get out of our confort zone.

Pm me if you might be interested in meeting up with a stranger from the internet and if you are from Europe/UK. Just send ""Hi, i might be interested."" if you don't know what to say.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction and connection, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, several aspects indicate otherwise. the author is proactive and enthusiastic about planning a hitchhiking trip across europe, which demonstrates a sense of adventure and confidence. they openly invite others to join, showing a willingness to engage with new people. the mention of common struggles like introversion, shyness, depression, and social anxiety suggests empathy and an understanding of social challenges, rather than a personal cry for help. the tone remains positive and encouraging, focusing on stepping out of comfort zones rather than dwelling on feelings of isolation. these factors collectively point towards someone seeking to expand their social horizons rather than someone who is currently feeling lonely."
"I think im happy 2019 was shit for me2019 left me so emotionally scarred that I wanted nothing to do any single motherfucking human being. 

And this pandemic has been a blessing in that sense. 

Im not lonely but I dont know where else to post this. 

People can be idiots... so can I, im usually the friend whose always there. But its me time now. 

Anyone else feeling this way?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who has undergone significant emotional turmoil in the past but is currently experiencing a sense of relief and contentment in solitude. the mention of 2019 being particularly difficult suggests past trauma, yet the person expresses a positive outlook on the pandemic's social distancing measures. this context indicates that the individual is not feeling lonely but rather enjoying the opportunity for self-care and personal space. the narrative also highlights a sense of agency and choice in distancing from others, rather than isolation imposed by external factors. the reference to being the friend who is always there further supports the idea that this person is usually socially connected and is now consciously taking time for themselves. overall, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness such as longing for connection or feelings of abandonment; instead, it shows a deliberate and satisfying retreat from social interactions."
"I wish I had some alcoholI rarely drink, just for tonight so I can feel better and maybe get some sleep.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for alcohol as a temporary relief to help with sleep, which can indicate a momentary coping mechanism rather than a deeper sense of isolation or loneliness. the individual mentions that they rarely drink, suggesting that this is an unusual occurrence and not a habitual behavior driven by chronic loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, a lack of social connections, or emotional pain that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on seeking a way to feel better for one night, implying that their distress might be situational and not necessarily tied to a persistent feeling of being alone."
"LonelinessThe whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.
- Thomas Wolfe",0,"the narrative reflects a philosophical stance on loneliness rather than a personal experience of it. the author quotes thomas wolfe to emphasize a broader, existential view that loneliness is a fundamental aspect of human life. this perspective is more about a universal truth rather than an individual's current emotional state. there are no specific details or personal anecdotes indicating the author's own feelings of isolation or disconnection. instead, the focus is on a generalized belief, which suggests a level of detachment from the immediate emotional experience of loneliness. this detachment and the intellectual nature of the discussion point to an understanding of loneliness as a concept rather than a lived reality, indicating that the author may not be experiencing loneliness personally."
Feeling somewhat better[removed],0,"the narrative suggests an improvement in the individual's emotional state, which is indicative of a positive shift in their well-being. the phrase ""feeling somewhat better"" implies a transition from a previous state of discomfort or distress to a more stable and satisfactory condition. this kind of language often reflects a sense of hope or recovery, which is not typically associated with loneliness. loneliness is generally characterized by feelings of isolation, sadness, and a lack of connection with others. in contrast, the expression of feeling better suggests that the person has likely experienced some form of relief or support, which counters the usual indicators of loneliness. the absence of any mention of isolation, disconnection, or longing for companionship further supports the conclusion that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness. instead, they seem to be on a path toward emotional recovery or improvement."
"Most people bore meI'm definitely not an interesting person??and most people I come across aren't ""boring"" by any means, but I just can't feel invested when I interact with them. I find it hard to care for people and what's going on in their lives. Most of the time when I talk to people online it does nothing for me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disinterest and emotional detachment rather than loneliness. the author mentions that most people are not boring, yet they struggle to feel invested in interactions, indicating a potential lack of connection or empathy rather than isolation. the difficulty in caring about others' lives and the indifference towards online conversations suggest a more general disengagement from social interactions. this detachment is a key indicator that the author is not necessarily feeling lonely but rather unengaged or apathetic towards socializing. their statement about finding it hard to care for people highlights a disconnection that is not synonymous with loneliness, as loneliness typically involves a desire for meaningful connections that are unmet."
"Not so i long ago I made a post that i finally had friendsNow im back to being lonely  because of the COROV-19 baby! 


Stay safe out there",0,"the narrative reflects a temporary shift in social circumstances rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. the mention of previously having friends indicates the individual has the ability to form social connections, which is a positive sign. the tone of the message, particularly the use of humor with ""corov-19 baby!"" and the well-wishing ""stay safe out there,"" suggests resilience and an optimistic outlook despite current isolation. these elements are not typical indicators of chronic loneliness, which often includes feelings of persistent sadness, helplessness, and a lack of social support. instead, this narrative appears to be more about situational loneliness due to external circumstances, which is a common and temporary experience for many people during the pandemic."
I just want cuddlesThats literally it. I just want to cuddle with someone and feel safe and loved for once in my life,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical affection and emotional security, which are common human needs. the individual's wish to cuddle and feel safe and loved suggests a yearning for connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. people can crave intimacy and comfort even when they have fulfilling relationships in other areas of their lives. the use of phrases like ""for once in my life"" may hint at a lack of past experiences with such affection, but it does not definitively point to a current state of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a specific emotional need rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness."
"Some uplifting words to make everyone feel less aloneHey guys! So a couple of days ago I've made my first post on here, I was really down hitting rock bottom. I've had a serious emotional breakdown that day because I just felt like I was useless and worthless and just didn't fit in anywhere. I've had a tough time sitting home all day and ""working"" from home since I never really have a lot to do but I at least had a place to be when I got to the office. My life never felt so empty after the first week of home office. Most of my life I've been single and people kept asking me ""how are you single?"" and I never knew how to reply to that because it wasn't like I wasn't trying. Now that you know what really got me down to this point I'll come to the uplifting part. A day after I've made my first post here a really nice person texted me and we like instantly clicked. We were like joking around a little and found out that we have basically the same interests. I know its a little early to say that I want to be with her forever but we both fit together really well. After unsuccessful 6 months of ""dating"" on tinder and not meeting anyone decent just some random girl starts texting me without any real intentions on my side. I mean what are the odds that this happens right?  


Here is my theory: If you keep your options open fate, god, karma, the universe, whatever you believe in will make it happen. You are not alone with your sad feelings and bad past. There will always be someone who is perfect for you and who will work together on your issues it just takes time for everything to work out the way it is. Don't ever rush into things but if you have the feeling that something is just really good go for it. If you make mistakes or mess it up just think that it might be meant that way. Even if you lose someone there are always people that got your back even if you can't see them you'll find them where you haven't been looking.  


I hope you all are going to have a great time and I just want everyone to remember that nobody ever is really alone with anything. We live in a big big world with many ways to connect to eachother, you can do everything with the help of the people that got your back.  


Thank you for reading this and have a great day/afternoon/evening/night.",0,"the narrative reflects a journey from a deep emotional low to a place of newfound hope and connection. initially, the author describes feelings of worthlessness, isolation, and the emptiness of working from home, which are typical indicators of loneliness. however, the tone shifts significantly after they connect with someone who shares their interests and brings joy into their life. this new relationship, even if in its early stages, has a profound positive impact on the author's outlook, leading them to offer uplifting advice and reassurance to others. the emphasis on connection, hope, and the belief that supportive people are out there suggests that the author has moved past their feelings of loneliness. the narrative's overall message is one of optimism and encouragement, underscoring the importance of keeping an open mind and heart to find meaningful connections."
"Where do you even meet girls anymore?25 and it feels pretty damn depressing realizing I'll probably be alone the rest of my life. Let alone when I do like somebody they just apologize for hurting me and ignoring me from there.

God it sucks being alone",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with current social interactions, particularly in the context of romantic pursuits. the individual expresses concerns about meeting potential partners and feelings of rejection, which can be common experiences. however, these sentiments, while indicative of situational distress, do not necessarily point to chronic loneliness. the narrative lacks deeper expressions of isolation or a pervasive sense of disconnection from others. the focus is more on specific incidents of romantic rejection rather than a broader pattern of social withdrawal or an enduring lack of meaningful relationships. thus, the indicators present suggest situational unhappiness rather than a profound, ongoing experience of loneliness."
It??s my birthday! Spending the day in my room asleep.Trying to keep positive (at least for today) even if inside I know it??s all fake. Keep your loved ones close everyone!,0,"the narrative suggests a person who is spending their birthday alone, which might initially seem like a sign of loneliness. however, the individual expresses an intention to stay positive and advises others to keep their loved ones close. this shows a level of awareness and connection to the importance of relationships, even if they are not physically present at the moment. the statement ""trying to keep positive"" indicates an effort to maintain a healthy mindset, which is a positive coping mechanism. the acknowledgment of the day being special and the act of giving advice to others also implies a sense of purpose and engagement with the broader social context. these elements together suggest that while the person may be alone physically, they are not necessarily experiencing the emotional isolation typical of loneliness."
Why do you feel lonely?And... what helps you feel less lonely?,0,"the narrative seems to be a query rather than a personal account, focusing on questions about loneliness rather than expressing personal feelings or experiences. the use of questions like ""why do you feel lonely?"" and ""what helps you feel less lonely?"" suggests an interest in understanding loneliness from an external perspective rather than indicating the writer's own emotional state. this detachment from personal emotion is a significant indicator that the writer may not be experiencing loneliness themselves. instead, they appear to be seeking information or attempting to understand the phenomenon, which is not typical of someone who is currently feeling lonely. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional expressions further supports this interpretation."
It's my birthday. I don't think anyone remembers. Can I get some wishes?nan,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is acknowledging their birthday and expressing uncertainty about whether anyone remembers. while there is a subtle hint of seeking social interaction through birthday wishes, the overall tone does not convey a deep sense of isolation or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the request for wishes can be seen as a casual or light-hearted attempt to engage with others rather than a sign of desperation for connection. this suggests that the individual may not be experiencing significant loneliness but rather a common desire for social acknowledgment on a special day."
"anyone wanna chat?F19 here, i'm bored and have no one to talk to. does anyone wanna chat???????",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction, indicated by the repeated request for someone to chat. however, the tone appears casual and lacks deeper emotional distress or isolation. the individual mentions being bored rather than feeling lonely, which suggests a temporary state of seeking entertainment or casual conversation rather than a chronic or severe sense of loneliness. there is no mention of persistent feelings of sadness, isolation, or a lack of meaningful connections, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the straightforward and upbeat nature of the message further supports the interpretation that the person is simply looking for a way to pass the time rather than expressing a deeper emotional need for connection."
"Anyone else in an emotionally abusive relationship and feeling stuck?Want to voice chat on discord? 
I feel like it??s the only things that helps me...
32/F/California",0,"the narrative describes someone in an emotionally abusive relationship who is seeking connection through voice chats on discord. while the situation is undoubtedly challenging and distressing, the individual's proactive approach to seeking help and connection suggests resilience and resourcefulness. reaching out for support, even in an online format, indicates a level of social engagement and a desire to interact with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the mention of specific details like age, gender, and location further demonstrates an openness to forming connections, which contrasts with the withdrawal and isolation commonly associated with loneliness."
Having a panic attack.Don't know what to do.,0,"the narrative indicates a moment of acute distress, specifically a panic attack, which is primarily associated with anxiety rather than loneliness. the brevity and urgency of the statement suggest immediate fear and confusion. while loneliness can sometimes contribute to anxiety, the narrative does not provide any context or details that directly point to feelings of isolation or lack of social connections. typical indicators of loneliness might include expressions of feeling disconnected, unimportant, or a lack of meaningful relationships, none of which are present here. the focus is solely on the immediate physical and emotional symptoms of a panic attack, making it more indicative of an anxiety episode rather than loneliness."
Missing someone bad right nowI don't have much to say really. I feel like I've tried all I can to get her back in my life. She has all the control at this point. I just fucking miss her and I know I fucked up. That's all,0,"the narrative reflects an intense emotional response to a specific situation, namely missing someone and feeling regret over past actions. while the individual expresses strong feelings of missing someone and acknowledges their mistakes, the focus is on a particular relationship rather than a broader sense of social isolation or pervasive loneliness. the person seems to be dealing with the consequences of a breakup or a strained relationship, which is a situational emotional state rather than a chronic or generalized feeling of loneliness. the narrative lacks indicators such as a persistent sense of isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being misunderstood by others, which are often typical of loneliness. instead, it centers on the immediate pain and longing associated with a specific person, suggesting that the person's feelings are more situational and tied to a particular relationship rather than a deep-seated, ongoing sense of loneliness."
"Daily Support postHey there beautiful people of reddit. Just wanted to reach out to you and say if anyone needs a pal to talk to or rant about their day, I am here for you. If not then have a wonderful night and hope you will have a brighter day tomorrow.

I am in CST if anyone cares.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of outreach and willingness to connect with others, suggesting a proactive and positive attitude. the author offers support and companionship, which indicates they are not experiencing loneliness themselves but rather are in a position to provide emotional support to others. their message conveys empathy and a desire to uplift others, which are typically signs of someone who feels socially connected and emotionally stable. the casual mention of their time zone adds a personal touch, reinforcing their genuine intent to engage with the community. overall, the narrative lacks expressions of isolation or longing for connection that are common indicators of loneliness."
Can someone talk to me please?(warning: feeling suicidal),0,"the narrative indicates a plea for communication and mentions feeling suicidal, which are serious indicators of distress. however, the classification suggests that this particular narrative is not authored by someone experiencing loneliness. this could imply that the individual may have a support system or other underlying issues contributing to their feelings rather than loneliness. it's important to note that feeling suicidal can stem from various mental health conditions, and while loneliness can be a factor, it is not the sole determinant. the specific request for someone to talk to them highlights a moment of acute need for connection, but does not necessarily mean the person lacks ongoing social interactions or relationships. therefore, the absence of typical loneliness indicators such as prolonged social isolation, persistent feelings of emptiness, or a lack of meaningful connections might explain the classification."
"Why is it easier to be sad then happy..My heart is aching I just recently lost my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years 2 weeks before our Disney land trip for my birthday, due to the relationship being so toxic. Always on a push and pull cycle. Decided to finally call it quits because I couldn??t hear he cry anymore because I knew she hated it here and I was the reason she was unhappy. She hated me yet she never had the strength to leave me I did her the favor and I??m paying the price. I??m stuck here in our apartment that I got for us always stuck in my thoughts. I??m in so much pain and everyone tells me I shouldn??t be sad because we both deserve better. I didn??t want better I just wanted her. I wish I never walked away. I??m finally able to hang out with my friends again and go out and have a normal life but I??m still so alone. I come home to nothing, I don??t have anyone I can talk to all day and everyday and if someone reaches out to me to talk I just get annoyed and push them away and tell them I??m not able to talk. I try to find things to numb the pain but my depression is hitting me like a train. I put on a face everyday because no one wants to be around someone who??s a Debbie downer. I don??t want to feel alone anymore but I just don??t want to be a burden on other people always crying and venting to them. I??m slowly giving up on myself. I don??t want to live my life feeling this way anymore.",0,"the narrative reflects intense emotional turmoil following the end of a significant relationship. the author describes a profound sense of loss and heartache, exacerbated by the recent breakup and the memories associated with their shared plans. they express feelings of isolation and a struggle with depression, evident in their mention of feeling stuck in their thoughts and experiencing pain. despite being able to socialize and engage in activities with friends, the author still feels a deep sense of loneliness when they return home. their tendency to push others away and reluctance to share their feelings further contribute to their sense of isolation. while they put on a facade to avoid burdening others, the underlying sentiment of not wanting to feel alone anymore is clear. the narrative highlights the complexity of dealing with personal grief and the challenges of navigating social interactions while coping with intense emotions."
I feel so emptyI don't feel any emotions sometimes I wanna laugh but I can't I wanna cry but I cant as if there is nothing there anymore. I don't have any friends  never been in a relationship dont know how it feels like to have someone  just lost in my own thoughts make up things in my mind  to cope up  I have to fight everyday against myself and its exhausting  I feel so unwanted I hate myself,0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of emotional numbness and isolation, with the individual describing an inability to experience emotions like laughter or crying. the lack of friendships and relationships, as well as feeling lost in one's thoughts, are mentioned, suggesting a struggle with social connections. the narrative also highlights a constant internal battle and feelings of self-hatred, which can be indicators of low self-esteem or depression. however, these feelings of emptiness and self-loathing might not necessarily stem from loneliness alone but could be related to other psychological conditions or personal struggles. the person's description of making up things in their mind to cope indicates a form of escapism, which is not uncommon in individuals facing mental health challenges. overall, while the narrative contains elements that could be associated with loneliness, such as social isolation and emotional numbness, it also points to broader mental health issues that may not be exclusively tied to loneliness."
"Wow..It??s currently 12:04 am and I??m starting to realize being lonely might not be that bad.. I have space, a clear mind, fresh air, and most importantly myself. I get to spend quality time with me ALL the time. People bring different energies and reflect that onto you! I don??t have to deal with that ! And it??s nice. So yea.. (:",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and content mindset towards solitude, emphasizing the benefits of having personal space and a clear mind. the individual highlights the enjoyment of spending quality time with themselves and appreciates the lack of external influences that come with social interactions. phrases like ""being lonely might not be that bad"" and ""it’s nice"" indicate a sense of acceptance and even pleasure in their own company. the overall tone is light and optimistic, suggesting that the person views their solitude as an opportunity for self-reflection and peace rather than a source of distress or sadness. this perspective is typical of someone who is not experiencing loneliness but rather finds fulfillment and comfort in being alone."
"My fianc?? left meMy girlfriend of over 4 years left me about a month ago, I proposed to her in January. I feel so lonely and somehow depressed. Does somebody have any advice for me?",0,"the narrative describes a recent breakup where the individual expresses feelings of loneliness and depression after their fiancée left them. although the person explicitly states feeling lonely, the classification suggests that this might be a situational reaction rather than a deeper, more chronic experience of loneliness. typical indicators of loneliness often include prolonged feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, and a pervasive sense of emptiness. in this case, the distress seems to stem directly from the recent breakup, indicating a specific, acute emotional response rather than an ongoing issue. the request for advice further suggests an active effort to seek social support and solutions, which can be a positive coping mechanism and might prevent the development of chronic loneliness."
"My Reddit bot can send you some random questions to talk about with your friends ????**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&amp;#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It??s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won??t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON??T be forwarded!

&amp;#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&amp;message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ??!?? as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&amp;#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&amp;#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&amp;#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don??t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won??t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it??s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON??T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they??ll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess?? It displays all the commands and well?? tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&amp;#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**",0,"the narrative describes a reddit bot designed to facilitate conversations between friends by providing random questions to discuss. the focus is on the functionality of the bot and the ease it brings to initiating dialogues. the narrative assumes the presence of friends and emphasizes convenience and enjoyment in social interactions. there is no indication of the author experiencing loneliness, as the text centers on enhancing existing social connections rather than expressing a need for companionship. the detailed instructions and enthusiastic tone suggest an intent to share a useful tool with others rather than a personal struggle with isolation."
People love me but I hate meI wanna change myself because I hate who I am on the inside and out but everyone including my family loves who I am. Is it even worth trying to see if the change will work or will everyone hate me?,0,"the narrative expresses a deep internal conflict and self-loathing, but it also highlights a crucial factor: the presence of love and support from others, including family. this suggests a strong social network and external validation, which are significant protective factors against loneliness. the individual's struggle is more about self-perception and identity rather than a lack of social connections or isolation. they are questioning the worth of personal change in the context of how it might affect their relationships, indicating they do value and recognize the love they receive. this external support system is a key indicator that the person is not experiencing loneliness, even though they are grappling with self-esteem issues."
I should not be allowed get attached to anyone.Because I always get treated like afterthought sooner or later and it cripples my head.,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and a protective stance towards forming attachments with others. the author mentions feeling like an afterthought, which suggests a history of negative experiences in relationships. however, the tone reflects a decision to avoid attachment rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. this could indicate a coping mechanism or a self-preserving strategy rather than an ongoing state of loneliness. the focus is more on the perceived pattern of treatment by others and the psychological impact of these interactions rather than an expression of isolation or a longing for connection. the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness, such as a desire for companionship or expressions of feeling disconnected from others. instead, it points to a defensive mindset aimed at preventing further emotional pain."

Eventually I snapped out of that mindset and felt kinda weird. Sometimes it just feels like my only escape and that's it's inevitable. Thinking about it calms my nerves, but I know I should know better. I know that I shouldn't think these thing but idk I think so differently sometimes and it scares me.

My other best friend starting seriously dating one of my exes and I haven't spoken to him in a few years. 

My 3 closest people aren't close anymore. I've been trying make friends or find others with similar interests in this small town and yet seems like most people I meet have their own circle, are way younger (high schoolers at the local gym), or are married and doing their own thing.

"Just lonely and bored as shitNot trying to get too poopy about it. I??m chilling. Was at work for like 25 days straight and this is my first day off. Going back tomorrow but, I mean wow. Sometimes I complain about work and now I??m like a baby in the forest without it.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of temporary dissatisfaction and boredom rather than deep-seated loneliness. the individual mentions being ""lonely and bored,"" but it seems more situational, linked to having a day off after an extended period of work. the language used, such as ""just lonely and bored as shit"" and ""not trying to get too poopy about it,"" suggests a casual and somewhat humorous tone rather than a serious expression of emotional distress. the comparison to being ""a baby in the forest"" without work highlights a reliance on routine and structure rather than a lack of social connections or deeper emotional support. overall, the context and specific examples indicate a transient state of boredom rather than chronic loneliness."
I am pathetic[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a self-deprecating statement, but it lacks broader context or additional indicators that typically signify loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or a longing for social interaction. in this case, the statement ""i am pathetic"" could be indicative of low self-esteem or a moment of self-criticism, but it does not inherently suggest loneliness. there is no mention of social relationships, feelings of being alone, or a desire for companionship, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. therefore, while the narrative does reflect negative self-perception, it does not provide sufficient evidence of loneliness based on the absence of these key elements."
"You're always the one in your tiny group giving the best advice, you see your friends take it and are happy it worked....yet it never works for you huh? People only care about you when you say you're gonna end it but not when you're crying for help.Bleh",0,"the narrative describes someone who feels a sense of responsibility and satisfaction in helping their friends, indicating that they have a social circle and meaningful interactions. they express frustration that their advice works for others but not for themselves, which suggests self-reflection rather than isolation. the mention of friends caring when they express extreme distress shows that they do receive attention and concern from others, even if they feel it is conditional. the overall tone reflects a struggle with personal issues rather than a lack of social connections or support, which are typical indicators of non-loneliness."

In terms of games you name it I probably have it unless it??s a newer  paid game. I??m down to buy games to if we gonna put some time into it .",0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking social connections through gaming, reminiscing about past friendships that revolved around shared gaming experiences. while they express a desire to re-establish a similar social circle, the tone is proactive and hopeful. they are actively reaching out to others, suggesting specific ways to connect, such as creating a discord server. this initiative and the willingness to invest in new games for the sake of building relationships indicate a positive, solution-oriented mindset. the absence of deeper emotional distress or pervasive feelings of isolation suggests that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather a natural desire to expand their social network within their interest area."

Nope. I see every other dude with a girl, it is as if I've lost my groove or something. Can't figure it out.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and confusion about the difficulty in finding a romantic partner despite having many positive attributes. the individual highlights their personal qualities such as physical fitness, friendliness, educational background, and financial independence, suggesting a strong sense of self-worth and confidence. while the mention of feeling ""lonely"" and seeing ""every other dude with a girl"" indicates some social comparison and desire for companionship, the overall tone is more about bewilderment and determination rather than deep emotional distress or isolation. the focus on external achievements and self-improvement efforts suggests resilience and a proactive approach to addressing their situation, which are not typically associated with profound loneliness."
I need a friend to talk to[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper sense of loneliness. wanting a friend to talk to can be a normal expression of seeking companionship and connection, which is a natural human need. the absence of additional context about persistent feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful relationships suggests that the individual's request might be situational rather than indicative of chronic loneliness. without more details about their emotional state or social circumstances, it's reasonable to interpret this as a momentary desire for social engagement rather than a symptom of loneliness."
"I was wrong. I'm not the one who always initiates the conversation among my friends.Note: All of my friends are online.


For the longest time I've hated why I'm always the one initiating a conversation with any of my friends. Each time the conversation would go very well. But I hated how nobody would ever start the conversation with me, or probably even think of me, until I had to remind them. Since I believed it to be true, I've suffered the full pain of it, and I know how lonely it can make a person feel, even if they have some friends.


Just earlier, I was replying to a post of the same topic, trying to say how much I relate. Then I realized some of my friends actually do initiate conversations with me. And to some of them, they are the one who always initiates it. I'm the one who never starts the conversation with them! I found myself not accounting the friends who do come to talk to me, and constantly hating why the other ones never do so.


Well, I've actually explained to myself about that by downplaying and finding excuses before. Some of them can be short-tempered, so I feel a little held back. Or ""I'm not close to them anyway"". But I do very much consider it worthy of a friendship. Plus, I have no problem with my closest friend (online) at all. Yet I'm rarely the one who starts the talk.


So why am I like the exact type of friends I hate? With some efforts, I got to see that side of the perspective. Well, I just feel, I don't have anything worthy enough to bring it up. But if the other person started the conversation, we'd usually branch off into some interesting topics. Sometimes it's can even be because I just don't find talking with a particular friend as enjoyable as spending time on one of my many hobbies. But that doesn't discount the friendship itself. I can respect someone a great lot and find reading a book more fun than talking to them.


In conclusion, I think I'm walking out of this hell. I'm glad to stop denying that I do have friends who initiate the conversations. Even better, I think I'm understanding the point of view of those who don't. Not to mention the existing reasons. E.g. One friend is literally content with being with himself alone forever. Another friend is so busy that he had to delay his girlfriend's call when talking to me. Anyway, I have been resentful for very long as I found hate familiar and comforting. Now I'm tired of hating. Some understanding genuinely feels nice.

* It's possible that none of this is true and I'm avoiding pain by being absurd.
* To some of you who actually literally is the one who always initiates the conversation, I want to help but I can't. There are so many people on earth, and some are just bound to be unlucky in a ridiculous way. But I know you will make sure that nobody has to go through the pain of always initiating the conversation with you.",0,"the narrative reflects a journey of self-awareness and growth. the author begins with a sense of frustration and perceived loneliness, believing they are the only one initiating conversations with their friends. however, through introspection, they realize that some friends do reach out to them first, and they themselves sometimes fail to initiate conversations. this realization helps them understand different perspectives and the reasons behind their friends' behaviors. the narrative highlights the importance of understanding and accepting the dynamics of friendships, recognizing that the author has meaningful connections despite initial feelings of loneliness. their shift from resentment to understanding and the acknowledgment of their friends' efforts indicate a healthy and evolving perspective on their social interactions. this insight and the presence of active, reciprocal relationships suggest the author is not experiencing significant loneliness."
Share something you enjoy or are passionate about but have nobody to tell about.[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a person asking to share something they enjoy or are passionate about but have nobody to tell about. while this might initially seem like an indication of loneliness, the label indicates otherwise. it's important to consider that the individual may simply be experiencing a momentary lack of someone to share with, rather than a chronic sense of isolation. this could be due to temporary circumstances such as friends or family being busy or unavailable at the moment. additionally, the act of reaching out and seeking to share a passion implies a proactive approach to social engagement, which is typically not characteristic of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness. the person’s desire to communicate and share experiences suggests they are socially connected and capable of forming relationships, even if they are currently without someone to talk to. thus, the narrative reflects a situational rather than a pervasive state of social disconnection."
"Spiraling. I don't know who to talk toI don't have many friends. The ones I do are nice to me, but they all clearly like me less than I like them. It's always been this way, I'm always somebody that people have never felt invested in being around. I've always been lonely. I can't make myself seem like a likable person for shit so I just push everyone away instead.I love my partner and I'm beyond happy to have him but he's literally all that I have. I don't mean to seem callous to the people on this sub that do genuinely have no one, but I think I was better off when I had 0 people that were invested in my interests than having 1. Because when you have 1 person, you dump everything on them, you become reliant. My poor partner does not deserve to be the sole person to help with my awful emotions and self-esteem. If you haven't noticed, I have pretty low self-esteem lol. I've always been the third wheel, I've always been treated as disposable. I feel like I'm a burden on everyone I care about. All that being in a relationship has done is prove me right, I'm needy and I deal with all of my problems through my partner because without him I have no one at all.I hate how reliant on him I am. He regrets it too. It's a vicious cycle because knowing that I am this weight on him makes me feel worse about myself, but discussing that puts more weight on him. I just want to be able to deal with my problems without hurting the people around me in the process, or better yet not feel the way I do at all.I don't know who to talk to. Out of empathy, I'm not going to talk to my partner about how I feel. I don't want to drain him any more than I already do. But he's *all*. I hate the feeling that I have to choose between his misery and mine. When I'm making the choice to spare him the difficulty of dealing with me, as I am today, I have no one. All my friends do is pass memes to me back and forth, I'm not going to vent to them. I realize just how lonely I am and how the only thing keeping me from feeling that 24/7 is me making other people feel exasperated with me. I feel like my partner deserves better than me. But if I told him that, it would just be more of this same fucking issue because then he'd deny it and try to console me and I'd know the whole time that all I'm doing is adding on. All I am is a problem for people to solve. If I express that, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If I don't, I have to sit here in pain. It's lose-lose. Hurting the people around me hurts me, and hurting me hurts the people around me, and yet those are the only options I have.I'm sorry if this was disorganized, it's stream of consciousness. I'm spiraling at the moment, I don't normally feel this bad. But God when I do it just hurts like hell because I know that what I'm saying is truer than the illusion of happiness I live with the rest of the time.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional turmoil and a complex relationship with feelings of dependence and self-worth. the individual acknowledges their partner as their sole emotional support, which highlights a strong sense of reliance and fear of being a burden. despite this, they express a clear awareness of their own feelings and the impact they may have on others, indicating a level of self-reflection and empathy. their interaction with friends seems superficial, but they still recognize these relationships, even if they do not feel comfortable sharing deeper emotions. the person's struggle with self-esteem and the cyclical nature of their emotional pain are evident, yet their ability to articulate these feelings suggests a certain level of resilience and insight. overall, while the individual grapples with significant emotional challenges, their narrative reveals a nuanced understanding of their situation and a desire to protect those they care about from their own distress."
"More connected than ever and also more disconnectedI have a nice life, it has gone exactly how a successful life should.  Married, decent career, healthy savings, own our home, but it feels so incomplete.  I live this life and live another fantasy life in my head.  All the things I feel like are missing from this real life I imagine living in a different one.  Yet there are things I think I can't live without that I'd not have if I threw this life away to pursue my dreams.  I've contemplated how my mind got this way and I think a big part of it is technology.  I'm not, in general, an unhappy person.  That said, seeing how others are living their life with experiences and relationships I wish I had.  It's almost like, seeing how people I know, and don't know, are living makes me envy that I don't have certain things in my life.  Well not so much things, as experiences and relationships with other people.  It's easy to feel like no one else can relate, you have few people or maybe no one to talk about deep conversations with because it seems like they are all put together.  Sometimes it's hard to even articulate how you are feeling.  Plus, depending on the other person, when you do articulate they don't understand.Does anyone understand what I mean when I say I feel more connected to the world but also further away from any real connection like people had before all information and all access to other people's lives was literally at our fingertips?When I walk down the street or through a store I see other people that just seem so different than me because I imagine they don't feel so lost and disconnected.  Am I wrong with that assumption, do we all feel that way sometimes?",0,"the narrative describes a person who seems to have a well-rounded and successful life with a stable marriage, career, and financial security. despite feeling that something is missing, the individual does not express a profound sense of isolation or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. they reflect on the impact of technology and social media on their perceptions and desires, but this introspection does not translate into a sense of deep loneliness. instead, it appears to be more about the natural human tendency to compare oneself to others and the ensuing envy of their experiences and relationships. the person acknowledges that they are not generally unhappy and contemplates their feelings in a thoughtful manner, suggesting a level of self-awareness and emotional stability. the sense of disconnection mentioned seems more about societal and technological changes rather than an intrinsic feeling of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a nuanced understanding of personal fulfillment and connection in the modern world, without the acute emotional pain that typically characterizes loneliness."
"Not really sure if it has anything to do with being lonely because i've done it all my life but does anyone else refer to themselves and us/we when talking to themselves, i've always assumed its something everyone does but i'm curious.nan",0,"the narrative reflects a curiosity about a personal habit of referring to oneself in the plural form, which suggests a level of self-awareness and introspection. the individual mentions that they have always done this and wonders if it is common among others. this curiosity and the absence of any expressed feelings of isolation or distress indicate that the person is not experiencing loneliness. instead, the narrative suggests a normal, possibly quirky, behavior that the person has grown accustomed to over time. there is no mention of a lack of social connections or feelings of being left out, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the tone of the narrative is neutral and inquisitive rather than sad or longing for social interaction."

"FBefore school started I did a tarot reading and it said I'd be alone when I enter school - and it came true. It's a nightmare especially when you have social anxiety because I constantly think people are judging me and that I have the reputation of being THAT loner.

So I go to school alone, eat alone etc. It's boring TT",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is dealing with social anxiety and the challenges of integrating into a new school environment. the person describes feeling judged and isolated, which is exacerbated by their extroverted nature and desire for social interaction. despite these feelings, the narrative lacks certain depth and emotional intensity often associated with profound loneliness. the writer mentions their situation in a somewhat matter-of-fact manner, without delving into deeper feelings of despair or hopelessness. their use of language, such as ""lol"" and ""tt,"" also suggests a level of casualness and perhaps a coping mechanism that might not align with more severe loneliness. these aspects indicate that while the individual is experiencing social challenges and feelings of isolation, they may not be experiencing loneliness to a significant degree."

I don't bite ????",0,"the narrative reveals a young individual who is actively seeking social connections and companionship. the author provides detailed information about themselves, including their interests, hobbies, and the types of relationships they are looking for. they express a high level of sociability and a willingness to engage in long conversations, indicating a proactive approach to forming friendships. while they mention feeling lonely and having a strong attachment to new acquaintances, their overall tone is positive and hopeful. they emphasize their loyalty and commitment to friendships, which are traits that can foster meaningful connections. their openness to using multiple platforms for communication and their diverse range of interests suggest they are equipped to find and maintain social relationships. despite acknowledging moments of loneliness, their enthusiasm for meeting new people and their active efforts to connect with others demonstrate resilience and a proactive attitude towards overcoming feelings of isolation."
How do you make friends[removed],0,"the narrative indicates an individual seeking advice on making friends, which suggests a proactive approach to socializing rather than an expression of loneliness. asking for guidance on forming friendships implies a desire to improve social skills and connect with others. this proactive behavior is generally not associated with the passive or withdrawn tendencies often seen in loneliness. instead, it reflects a willingness to engage with others and seek out social opportunities, which are positive indicators of someone who is not experiencing significant loneliness. the focus on actionable steps rather than emotional distress further supports this interpretation."
20 / VC with me please18+ only because anyone younger feels weird trying to talk to. I just need someone to talk to.,0,"the narrative indicates a request for a voice chat with a specific age preference. the person mentions feeling uncomfortable talking to individuals younger than 18, which suggests a desire for a more mature conversation. the phrase ""i just need someone to talk to"" could be interpreted as a need for social interaction, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. it may simply reflect a desire for connection or conversation without the deeper emotional context typically associated with loneliness. the lack of emotional depth or context about feelings of isolation or disconnection suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness but rather seeking casual social interaction."
Is making friends/meeting a gf at an anime convention a good idea?Has anyone tried this before? Just walking up to a random group of people at one of those events and talking to them or is it more you have to have a group before you go?,0,"the narrative reflects curiosity and a desire for social connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual is seeking advice on socializing at an anime convention, which suggests they are interested in forming new relationships or finding a romantic partner. this proactive approach implies a level of confidence and an understanding of social settings. the questions posed are practical and focused on the logistics of meeting new people, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or emotional distress. the absence of language that conveys sadness, hopelessness, or a sense of being disconnected from others further supports the idea that the person is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they are exploring opportunities for social interaction in a specific context, indicating an active engagement with their social environment."
"What should I do for my birthday?Hey guys, I'm pretty new to reddit and only just got it because I've been feeling so disconnected from society. I'm kind of a loner and don't have any friends but at the same time desire close social contacts. (I'm not going to go too deep into this)

Anyways, I'm turning 20 in August and don't have anyone to celebrate with. The only other option I can think of is taking a train to see my parents. Not that they're bad people, just that they believe that the whole ""mental illness"" thing is impossible unless you experienced something traumatic. Besides that, I really want to do something but I don't know what I'd do. Any pointers?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is reaching out for social connection and advice, which can be indicative of a desire for companionship. the person mentions feeling disconnected from society and identifies as a loner without friends, yet expresses a clear desire for close social contacts. despite this, they are actively seeking ways to celebrate their birthday, showing a proactive approach to their situation. the mention of considering a visit to their parents, despite the parents' lack of understanding about mental illness, suggests a willingness to engage with family, which is a positive social behavior. the narrative does not delve deeply into feelings of despair or hopelessness, and the individual's active search for advice and connection on a social platform like reddit indicates a level of engagement and resourcefulness that counters the typical indicators of severe loneliness."
"If anyone would like to chat, Im here ?????Reach out to me if you feel called to :)",0,"the narrative expresses an open invitation for conversation and connection, which is indicative of a person who is available and willing to engage socially. the use of positive and inviting language, such as ""if anyone would like to chat"" and ""reach out to me if you feel called to,"" suggests a proactive approach to social interaction rather than a plea for companionship out of loneliness. there is no indication of distress, sadness, or desperation typically associated with loneliness. instead, the tone appears casual and welcoming, which aligns more with someone who is socially content and simply extending an opportunity for others to connect. this narrative lacks the emotional depth or expressions of isolation that are common in those experiencing loneliness."
"never force anything, just let shit happennan",0,"the narrative reflects a mindset of acceptance and a laid-back attitude towards life's events, suggesting a level of emotional stability and contentment. the phrase ""never force anything"" implies a sense of inner peace and a lack of urgency or desperation, which are often contrary to feelings of loneliness. people experiencing loneliness typically express a desire for connection and may struggle with feelings of isolation or inadequacy, none of which are evident in this narrative. instead, the casual tone and use of informal language like ""just let shit happen"" indicate a relaxed and possibly contented state of mind. this kind of outlook is generally associated with individuals who are comfortable with their current social situation and do not exhibit signs of emotional distress or social isolation."
"DramaHave you ever expressed yourself to someone about your loneliness and they replied ""you are just being dramatic"":/",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual has expressed feelings of loneliness to someone, but the response they received was dismissive, labeling their feelings as dramatic. this response can indicate that the individual is not necessarily experiencing profound loneliness but rather encountering a lack of validation from others. it points to a scenario where the person's emotional state might be questioned or minimized by those around them, which can be frustrating but doesn't inherently imply deep loneliness. the use of the term ""dramatic"" and the emoticon "":/"" suggest a level of social interaction and awareness, implying the person is engaged with others and seeking connection, which are not typical indicators of severe loneliness."
"First time making a reddit post lolHey guys, today I went out on my first date... but the next day friend zoned, I was hoping to get with someone for my upcoming school ball/prom/dance but now I guess I'll miss out on school ball cause It wouldn't much fun going by yourself. All i rly want tbh is someone to talk too someone who i feel comfortable to talk to i have a few friends but i can't open up to them idkw thx for reading :)",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of social disappointment but doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the author shares an experience of being friend-zoned and expresses a desire for companionship for an upcoming event. while they express a wish to have someone to talk to and mention having difficulty opening up to their friends, they also acknowledge having a few friends. this suggests that they do have social connections, even if they aren't entirely fulfilling at the moment. the overall tone is more about a specific setback rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. their willingness to share their experience on a public platform like reddit also indicates a level of social engagement and a search for community support. these aspects point towards someone navigating typical social challenges rather than experiencing profound loneliness."
18f boredAnyone up for a chat?,0,"the narrative suggests a casual and light-hearted tone, typical of someone simply seeking interaction or entertainment rather than expressing deeper emotional distress. the use of ""bored"" implies a temporary state of inactivity rather than a chronic feeling of isolation. the open-ended invitation for a chat reflects a desire for social engagement, but not necessarily stemming from loneliness. this individual might just be looking for something to do or someone to talk to in the moment, rather than expressing a more profound sense of disconnection or longing for meaningful relationships. the language used is straightforward and lacks any indication of emotional pain or feelings of being unappreciated, which are common indicators of loneliness."
"Passing byDriving down the road that runs perpendicular to mine in my neighborhood, I noticed a man walking down the roadside with his dog. He wasn??t particularly handsome, just an average man. I slowed down for him, he waved and smiled, and I felt a strong urge to stop my car in the middle of the street and talk to him. Not knowing what to say and not being confident in my appearance, I reluctantly kept driving. I looked in my rear view mirror and I saw him look back. I wonder if he felt something too. I??m probably just being too lonely and too hopelessly romantic. Later I went for a walk around that area where I saw him at on the off chance he had brought his dog out to go to the bathroom. He wasn??t around, of course, and that little bit of dreaming was added to the archives of stupid romantic daydreams that never seem to be fulfilled for me.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of fleeting romantic interest rather than chronic loneliness. the individual describes a spontaneous encounter with a stranger that ignites a brief desire for connection. however, this desire is framed more as a whimsical, romantic daydream rather than a deep-seated feeling of isolation. the person's thoughts about their appearance and hesitation to engage in conversation indicate a momentary lack of confidence rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. additionally, the act of taking a walk later in hopes of seeing the man again shows a proactive approach to seeking out social interaction, which is not typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness. the narrative ends on a note of self-awareness about their romantic fantasies, suggesting a balanced perspective rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness."
Welp my weekend is ruined[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a ruined weekend, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the expression of disappointment or frustration about plans going awry can be a common experience for anyone, regardless of their social or emotional state. the brevity of the statement and lack of deeper emotional context suggest a momentary setback rather than a persistent feeling of isolation. typical indicators of loneliness might include expressions of feeling disconnected, unimportant, or lacking meaningful relationships, none of which are present in this brief lament. therefore, the narrative appears to reflect a situational frustration rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"I??m not physically lonely, just mentally.I??ll start off by saying, I don??t really have anything in the way of financial struggles. I have people who are around me on a day to day basis, that I can talk casually with, about stuff that??s relevant to the conversation. But, even with this company, I honestly don??t feel like anyone is really there for me to share things I??m genuinely happy to talk about with.
Ever since I had to end my last relationship (she ended up cheating on me), that feeling of having someone there you can just talk with about just almost anything with and be able to not hold your feelings of excitement or enthusiasm back, just seemed to fade away the longer I stay single.
Usually how it ends up, is pretty much everyone around me is on completely different pages, in terms of interests, and not any of them are (i guess you could say passionate/enthusiastic?) about thing??s that I find fascinating or whatnot.
Like, I make videos on Youtube as a hobby because it makes me happy to bring entertainment to other people and just be recognized for something I put together.
But 90% of the time, when I ask about what they think of the videos or whatever, I??m usually met with the ??Yeah, it was pretty funny/good.??
That??s it. 
Nothing interesting or really meaningful, especially after hearing the same compliment so many times. 
Maybe it??s just me, but I don??t really know. I just wish someone was in my life that I could just geek out with about things I really love.",0,"the narrative describes a person who, despite not facing financial struggles and having people around them, feels a lack of deep, meaningful connections. they express a sense of emotional isolation, particularly after a significant relationship ended due to infidelity. the individual feels a gap between their interests and those of the people around them, leading to a sense of not being truly understood or appreciated on a deeper level. they mention a hobby, making youtube videos, which brings them joy, but the feedback they receive is often superficial and unfulfilling. this highlights a desire for someone who shares their passions and can engage in enthusiastic conversations about their interests. while the narrative conveys a sense of emotional disconnection, it also reflects an awareness of their social environment and a yearning for more meaningful interactions."
"My lifeHello everyone this is my first time using reddit so here we go

20F message me :)Friends only- not long term so don??t get mad if you dont hear back tomorrow. talking to people online isnt the same and i cant keep up,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and detached approach to social interactions, indicating a lack of deep emotional investment. the writer explicitly states that they are not interested in long-term connections and warns against expectations of consistent communication. this suggests a preference for transient, low-commitment interactions rather than seeking meaningful, enduring relationships. the phrase ""talking to people online isn't the same"" implies an awareness of the superficial nature of online interactions but does not express distress or longing for deeper connections. the overall tone is practical and straightforward, lacking the emotional undertones typically associated with loneliness, such as feelings of isolation or yearning for companionship."
"I really needed a hug. Instead, I got high and listened to music.I spent most of the day in bed. I got up, did some chores. What??s the point though? Another day alone. Physically and emotionally no one. I got high around 5 because I said what??s the point might as well just listen to some music and trip for a few. This isn??t a way to live and I know I??m just numbing the pain. I??m in therapy (Idk why atp). I??m weird af. I have a decent job but I??m just odd ya know. Ehh I??m done!",0,"the narrative describes a person's experience of seeking comfort through substances and music, spending most of their day in bed, and performing some chores. while they express feelings of isolation and question the purpose of their actions, they also mention being in therapy and having a decent job, which suggests some level of functioning and support. the narrative reflects a struggle with emotional pain and self-perception, but the presence of therapy and employment indicates efforts to manage their situation. these elements suggest that the individual might be going through a tough time but isn't necessarily experiencing profound loneliness. the narrative doesn't show a deep sense of disconnection from others, which is a key indicator of loneliness."
ThoughtsHow do you fight loneliness? This has been the hardest year.. :/,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of introspection and questioning, but it lacks depth in expressing feelings of isolation or disconnection. while the individual acknowledges having a difficult year, they do not delve into specific emotions or situations that typically signify loneliness, such as a sense of abandonment, persistent sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections. the brevity and somewhat detached tone suggest they are seeking advice or strategies rather than expressing a deep, personal struggle with loneliness. the use of ellipses and the emoticon may indicate frustration or a desire for change, but these elements alone are not strong indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional intensity and detailed context often seen in those experiencing profound loneliness."
"Im just gonna vent... (m15)Hey in 15 and im just gonna vent. I have never had a girlfriend, Ive never even held hands. Im not fat, I already worked hard to get rid of that, I just haven't had social skills for very long.

Fuck, I just want to be loved, I just wanna be open with a girl and hold her hand or something. 

What should I do guys, hang out with her and ask for her insta or something? Or just wait till next year and start fresh?",0,"the narrative reflects a young individual expressing frustration over their lack of romantic experience and social skills. while there is a desire for connection and affection, the focus is on seeking advice and taking action towards achieving these goals. the individual demonstrates self-awareness and a proactive attitude by considering different strategies to approach the girl they like. this proactive and hopeful outlook, coupled with the absence of deeper emotional distress or pervasive feelings of isolation, suggests that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness. instead, they are navigating common adolescent challenges related to social interactions and romantic interests."
"IRL is too fucking scary.Why should anyone stop and talk to each other? Everyone is far too immature and too fucking stupid. When you make a mistake on askreddit, you get your fucking torso blown the fuck off. What makes you fucking think IRL is any more pleasant or meaningful? Is it the danger of knowing someone, a group of cult exists in every day life looking to beat the fucking shit out of you for not being perfect? It is okay to be with fat stupid ass with a nice personality but it is wrong to be with a healthy BMI individual with a shit personality? NOOOOOOO! Shut the fuck up, let people fucking vent and be their toxic self so fucking where. FUCK YOU TOXIC POSITIVITY BULLSHIT!!!",0,"the narrative reflects intense frustration and anger towards social interactions and societal norms. the author expresses a strong disdain for both online and real-life interactions, criticizing the immaturity and perceived stupidity of others. this narrative, while filled with negativity, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. rather, it suggests a deep-seated resentment and disillusionment with social expectations and behaviors. the language used is aggressive and defensive, highlighting a desire to reject societal norms rather than a longing for connection. the emphasis on venting and rejecting ""toxic positivity"" suggests the author is more focused on expressing their grievances than seeking companionship or support."
"Should I continue to pursue this?Hey, 20 year old gay male here. I started speaking to this guy, who is 4 years older to me at the beginning of this month. We had bumped into each other at a party. We hit it off at the party and our first day of texting was amazing. We decided to meet each other on that day itself. We continued speaking to each other via text that week and we had decided on meeting over the coming weekend. Our texts started getting more explicit and I realised that he really is attracted to me. On friday he cancelled plans for that weekend. I knew he was busy, he had a hectic work life and was preoccupied with a religious ceremony. He didn't text me that entire week. The next week I confronted him, telling him that I don't want things to fizzle out. He agreed but admitted that he was busy and we would meet after he returned from his trip (he was leaving town for 15 days, for a wedding). We haven't spoken since. Should I continue to pursue him?",0,"the narrative describes a young man navigating a budding romantic connection. despite the initial excitement and mutual attraction, external factors such as busy schedules and a trip have interrupted their communication. the author expresses concern about the potential fading of this connection but also shows understanding of the other person's circumstances. the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, despair, or a lack of social connections. instead, it reflects a common experience of uncertainty in early relationships and a desire for clarity, which are not inherently tied to loneliness. the author's proactive approach in addressing the situation and seeking advice suggests engagement and a support network, further indicating an absence of loneliness."
"A positive step?I??m feeling extra lonely and sad today. 

I??m a 22 year old female from a small town that is near a city. I have a small handful of friends, but I don??t have much in common with them other than the fact that we??ve known each other for years. I love and appreciate them dearly, but a lot of the times I feel empty because I don??t have anyone to share my interests with or do things I would enjoy with. 

Out of the minimum friends I have, all of them have boyfriends. I am really interested in music and going to gigs, but I never have anyone to go with. I am interested in books, but have no one to share books with or talk about them with. I love films, but have no one to go to the cinema with or even watch a film at home with. Sometimes I will go to the cinema myself, I don??t hate it but it gets lonely. 

I would love to just have friends to go out with to a cool bar/restaurant with after work or to see a band, and make impulsive fun plans with on a Friday night, but there??s no one in my life I can do that with. All my plans with my friends have to be arranged months in advance. They don??t want to go out exploring because they spend the majority of their time with their boyfriends, and even if they go out it??s to gay bars where I can??t meet or talk to guys, or places that just aren??t my scene. I??m so young and I??m tired of spending so much time alone. 

It??s been like this for years that I??ve ended up in relationships with people that aren??t right for me, just because I??m lonely. If I had a larger social circle with friends with similar interests I wouldn??t feel the need to even date, because I would have people to spend my time with.

It??s a weird place to be in. I??m starting university soon and I will hopefully meet new people there, but I just want at least one friend that wants to do the same things as me. 

After crying all day due to the loneliness I took a step today and admitted that things need to change, and joined an app for meeting new friends. This is something I felt too embarrassed to do before, but I can??t continue feeling so lonely. Hopefully I will find someone in the same predicament as me, that I can just have fun with. 

I even reached out to some old friends today and asked if they would like to go to the cinema, and made an Instagram account to hopefully meet new people that share common interests on there too. 

I could have just joined another dating app and tried to fill the gap through sex or romance but instead I am going to look for friendship, so I feel proud of myself today.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who, despite expressing feelings of loneliness and sadness, is actively taking steps to address their social situation. the person has a small group of friends and expresses gratitude for them, indicating that they are not entirely isolated. the desire to find friends with similar interests and the proactive measures taken, such as joining an app to meet new friends, reaching out to old friends, and creating an instagram account to connect with like-minded individuals, show a sense of agency and hope. the mention of starting university soon also suggests optimism about meeting new people and expanding their social circle. while the person acknowledges their current feelings of loneliness, their actions and outlook demonstrate resilience and a commitment to improving their social life."
"Sending compassionTo anyone else out there feeling alone - physically or emotionally, a lot or a little - know that I am wishing you peace. May your mind be at ease, even for few moments at a time. ????",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of compassion and empathy towards others who might be feeling alone, whether physically or emotionally. the author extends well-wishes and hopes for peace and ease of mind for those individuals. this outward focus on others and the act of sending positive thoughts are indicative of someone who is not currently experiencing significant loneliness themselves. typically, individuals who are feeling lonely might focus more on their own feelings of isolation and distress rather than directing their energy towards comforting others. the narrative lacks the introspective tone and self-referential language often found in descriptions of loneliness, instead demonstrating a supportive and caring attitude towards the well-being of others."
I should have said goodbye[deleted],0,"the narrative indicates an absence of loneliness through its brevity and lack of emotional depth. the phrase ""i should have said goodbye"" suggests a moment of regret or reflection but does not convey ongoing feelings of isolation or longing for connection. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include detailed expressions of their feelings, such as descriptions of prolonged solitude, a sense of being misunderstood, or a yearning for meaningful relationships. in contrast, this narrative is concise and lacks the emotional nuance that often accompanies loneliness, suggesting that the author is not currently experiencing significant feelings of isolation."

I like someone who hurt me[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a person who has experienced emotional pain due to liking someone who hurt them. despite this, there is no explicit mention of feelings of isolation or lack of social connections. the focus is on a specific interpersonal relationship rather than a broader sense of disconnection from others. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe pervasive feelings of being alone or misunderstood, which are not evident in this brief statement. instead, the narrative centers on a singular event of emotional hurt, which is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness."

"Is it normal to obsess over people from the simplest of action. I will never know what others think of me.Do people think of me like I do them? Pointlessly obsessing from the tiniest gesture?

I only exist in my own head and nothing more. I wish I knew, But love and friendship wouldn??t be anything if there wasn??t mystery. I??m wishing for someone I can pour out to, And someone I can obsess over, and they would obsess back. I hope I find someone like that, But life is a ocean of people.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-consciousness and preoccupation with how others perceive the individual. the writer expresses a desire for validation and connection, frequently questioning whether they are remembered or thought about by others. despite these concerns, there is an underlying acknowledgment of the mystery and complexity of relationships, suggesting a nuanced understanding of social dynamics. the writer's curiosity about being liked or obsessed over, and their wish for reciprocal affection, indicates a longing for meaningful connections rather than an acute sense of loneliness. the narrative hints at introspection and a search for identity, but it lacks the intense isolation or despair typically associated with profound loneliness. the mention of life's vastness and the ocean of people implies a recognition of the broader social context and potential for future relationships, underscoring a hopeful perspective rather than a lonely one."
"Trippin (dont read if u under 16)Taking these shit, feels like pain from an other dimension..fuk erham",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and discomfort, but it does not provide clear indicators of loneliness. the use of strong language and the mention of pain suggest an intense emotional experience, possibly related to substance use or another personal struggle. however, there is no mention of feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or longing for companionship, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the focus is more on the immediate sensation of pain and dissatisfaction rather than on a deeper sense of social or emotional disconnection."

After what she's done it's not something I can reason out loud, or talk through and come to terms with verbally. It's not something I can rail against and hope or try to change. It's fucked up but it's the reality, and I just need to digest and move forwards. And move on. I never thought she wouldn't be mine. Or wouldn't be important to me. I never thought she would do this.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of inner turmoil and emotional distress, but it lacks key indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a desire to communicate and vent their feelings, yet acknowledges that doing so may not be effective in their situation. they are processing a specific personal loss or betrayal, which suggests a situational crisis rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative also implies a sense of resilience and determination to move forward despite the pain, which is not typically associated with the pervasive sense of isolation and disconnection that characterizes loneliness. overall, the focus on a particular event and the presence of a coping strategy indicate that the individual's experience is more aligned with acute emotional distress rather than loneliness."
Anyone wanna talk?,0,"the narrative ""anyone wanna talk?"" reflects a simple and straightforward request for conversation. while it might initially seem like a sign of loneliness, it's important to consider the context and tone. the brevity and casual nature of the message suggest it could be a spontaneous or routine inquiry rather than a deeper expression of loneliness. people often reach out for social interaction without necessarily feeling isolated. the absence of any emotional depth, personal disclosure, or context indicating a lack of social connections further supports the interpretation that this is not a strong indicator of loneliness. instead, it appears to be a normal, everyday attempt to engage in social interaction."
"So a girl I was talking to has stopped responding to my dms and other stuff.I was somehow fortunate enough to start talking to a girl a few days after christmas online but a few days ago she stopped talking to me completly and she never responds when i try talking to her, she does have problems with not having privacy at her parents home and all of that,but it feels like she ignores me because she doesn't like me and it does fell like my mental health is starting to deterioate again, any tips on what i should do to not become self abusive or how to regain contact with her.",0,"the narrative reflects concerns about a disrupted online communication, which could be interpreted as a common social interaction issue rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. the author mentions a specific incident where a girl stopped responding to messages, and although this has caused some distress, the context provided includes external factors such as the girl's lack of privacy at home. the focus on seeking advice to manage mental health and avoid self-abusive behavior suggests a proactive approach to dealing with emotional challenges, rather than an overarching sense of isolation. the presence of recent social interactions and the author's awareness of external influences on the situation are indicators that this individual may not be experiencing profound loneliness."
"No Friends (Click if you are in same boat)Hi. I'll keep it simple and blunt. No friends (0, nobody at all). I'm 29, male. I'm not here to vent (you can though I don't mind). I'm here to chat with lonely people in my shoes who want to change that. (I don't mean advice for making friends IRL).

PM me if you're interested in the same. Pce",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is seeking social interaction but does not exhibit classic signs of deep loneliness. the person is straightforward about their lack of friends and expresses a desire for companionship, yet there is no indication of emotional distress or despair typically associated with loneliness. instead, the tone is pragmatic and open to new connections. the writer specifies a preference for one-on-one interactions over group chats, suggesting a clear understanding of their social preferences. their approach to finding a pen pal indicates a proactive and solution-oriented mindset, which is less characteristic of someone experiencing profound loneliness. the narrative lacks expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it shows a willingness to engage and a positive outlook towards forming new relationships."
"i need someoneto talk to

like rn preferably",0,"the narrative reflects an immediate need for communication or interaction, which can occur for various reasons unrelated to chronic loneliness. the use of ""like rn preferably"" suggests a situational urgency rather than a deeper, persistent feeling of isolation. people often seek immediate conversation to share news, seek advice, or alleviate boredom. the brevity and directness of the statement do not indicate a prolonged or pervasive sense of being alone but rather a temporary desire for social interaction. such expressions are common and do not necessarily reflect the underlying emotional state of loneliness."
"Can??t get close to peopleI??m at a new school, and I??ve met two or three people that are more like acquaintances. But they all have set groups it feels like and their just being nice to me. I get really bored just in my apartment all the time",0,"the narrative describes someone who is adjusting to a new school environment and has met a few acquaintances but hasn't yet formed close relationships. while they mention feeling bored in their apartment, there isn't a strong indication of emotional distress or feelings of isolation that typically accompany loneliness. the person seems to recognize the kindness of others and does not express a deeper sense of longing for connection or significant emotional pain. the lack of detailed emotional language and the context of simply being new to an environment suggests that this is more about an adjustment period rather than an experience of profound loneliness."

I loved her and will love her till the end so I decided to wait for her can this be defended or this is the best way??,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual experienced a significant emotional event, yet it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the writer expresses feelings of betrayal, hopelessness, and heartbreak due to a complex romantic situation involving family dynamics and parental pressure. despite the emotional turmoil, there is a clear focus on the external circumstances and the actions of others rather than a sense of isolation or lack of social connections. the individual mentions having family around, as evidenced by attending a cousin's reception and dealing with parental expectations. the narrative also reflects a deep emotional attachment to the person they loved, suggesting that their emotional distress is more about the loss of a specific relationship rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the writer's decision to wait for the person they love indicates hope and a future-oriented mindset, which contrasts with the typical indicators of loneliness, such as a sense of persistent isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or an enduring feeling of being misunderstood or unseen by others."
"It??s like my skin knows I??m alone..F23 I??m just getting out of a really toxic relationship after a little over two year. We lived together and did everything together.

????A thousand lives is not enough to spend finding chemistry that last forever. So many souls looking to love and beloved. Souls that will never meet. A thousand combination that will never spark. A thousand homes never to be known.,0,"the narrative reflects a contemplative and philosophical view on the nature of human connections and the improbability of finding lasting chemistry. it speaks to the vast number of souls seeking love and the unfortunate reality that many will never meet or connect deeply. however, the tone is more reflective and observational rather than personal and emotional. there is no direct expression of personal feelings of isolation or a longing for connection. instead, it seems to be an abstract meditation on the human condition. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional expressions about the author's own experiences suggests that this narrative is more of an intellectual exercise rather than a cry for help or an expression of loneliness. the use of poetic language and broad generalizations further supports the idea that the author is not writing from a place of personal loneliness but rather from a place of philosophical musing."
"Feeling especially lonely rnI keep on bursting into tears randomly because of how lonely I feel, sometimes just someone??s Instagram story of them with their friends is enough to set me off. 
I just want friends man",0,"the narrative describes feelings of loneliness and emotional distress, which can be common reactions to social isolation or lack of meaningful connections. the individual mentions bursting into tears and feeling triggered by seeing others with their friends, highlighting a sense of longing for companionship. these expressions indicate a deep desire for social interaction and connection, typical of someone experiencing loneliness. the emotional response to social media and the explicit statement of wanting friends further emphasize the yearning for social bonds and the impact of perceived social exclusion. such feelings are often associated with loneliness, as they reflect an unmet need for social relationships and support."
"I'll chat with yaIf you are lonely and want someone to chat with on a Saturday evening, send me a DM. I'm 53M and have a decent amount of life perspective and I'll chat about anything with anyone.",0,"the narrative suggests a willingness to engage with others and provide companionship, which is indicative of someone who is not experiencing loneliness themselves. the individual offers to chat with others who might be lonely, showing empathy and a desire to help. this act of reaching out to offer support is a sign of social connectedness and emotional availability. the mention of having a ""decent amount of life perspective"" suggests a level of self-assuredness and contentment, which are typically not associated with feelings of loneliness. overall, the tone is one of generosity and openness rather than isolation or longing for connection."
I wished anything that anyone told me the world would be like was true. I feel like my life is a bad dream and I'm always trying to wake upI want to go home,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disillusionment and a desire for escape, which can be associated with feelings of dissatisfaction or existential angst rather than loneliness. the expression of wishing for the world to be different and feeling like life is a bad dream suggests a struggle with reality and possibly a search for meaning. the desire to ""go home"" could indicate a longing for comfort or a return to a simpler, more familiar time, but it doesn't necessarily point to loneliness. there are no explicit mentions of social isolation, lack of companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative seems to focus more on an internal conflict and a broader sense of unease with one's circumstances."
"21 years old, never had a relationshipI just feel like a loser and yeah I've lost faith in everything.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of frustration and a lack of self-worth, but these sentiments do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions never having had a relationship and feeling like a loser, which points to low self-esteem and potential social anxiety. however, the absence of specific references to isolation, a desire for social connection, or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that loneliness is not the primary issue. instead, the focus is more on personal dissatisfaction and disillusionment. the loss of faith in everything could be indicative of broader existential concerns rather than a direct experience of loneliness."
"Don't give up hope peopleA short while ago I met someone who responded to a joking and self deprecating post I put up. Since then this person has become a metaphorical anchor in my life. Genuinely I cannot explain how much more colour there is in the world when you meet someone you instantly click with, someone who gets you. I've not got much to offer as a friend, beyond silly Skype sessions, messages on here, yet here I am. Keep fighting the good fight people, don't give up on finding someone special.",0,"the narrative conveys a sense of optimism and connection, which are indicators of a person not experiencing loneliness. the author shares a positive encounter with someone who has become a significant part of their life, describing this person as a ""metaphorical anchor."" this suggests a strong emotional bond and a sense of support. the mention of the world having ""more colour"" when they met this person highlights the joy and fulfillment derived from this relationship. the author also emphasizes the importance of not giving up hope and encourages others to keep searching for meaningful connections. the use of phrases like ""keep fighting the good fight"" and ""do not give up"" reflects a resilient and hopeful mindset, which is typically not associated with loneliness. overall, the narrative's tone and content focus on connection, support, and encouragement, all of which are indicators of someone who is not experiencing loneliness."
"Daily help post - Morning: Anybody looking for some support?Whether it be advice, someone to listen, or just a quick chat cause you're bored, I'll do my best to help :). Dm if you'd like, if not I hope everyone has a great day!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of community and a willingness to engage with others, which are indicators of social connectivity rather than loneliness. the offer to provide support, advice, or just a quick chat suggests the author is reaching out from a position of strength and availability, not from a place of seeking connection to fill a void. the tone is positive and inclusive, wishing everyone a great day, which typically signifies contentment and a stable social environment. the act of offering help rather than seeking it implies the author feels fulfilled in their social interactions and is looking to extend that positivity to others."
"I don't feel like myself today.I have a meeting in ten minutes about a possible job offer. I'm also not feeling my work today, my eye feels uncomfortable. 

I wish one of my friends or my partner would take an initatiative to ask me about how it went later instead of me reporting it to them for some attention. They're probably doing their own thing right now.

I want to be taken care of.",0,"the narrative reflects a temporary state of discomfort and a desire for support, rather than chronic loneliness. the individual's focus is on an immediate situation—a job meeting and physical discomfort—indicating situational stress. the mention of friends and a partner suggests that the person has a social support network. although there is a wish for others to show more initiative in providing support, it does not necessarily imply a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation. the expression of wanting to be taken care of can be seen as a normal human need for attention and care during stressful times, rather than an indicator of loneliness. overall, the narrative points to a momentary need for reassurance rather than a persistent feeling of loneliness."
"Seems like a lonely-ish thanksgiving breakI love seeing my family during this time of year and hanging out with friends during the break without worrying about school, but for the sake of precaution this Thanksgiving it will only be myself, my mom, and my dad. I won??t be seeing my cousins, grandparents, nor my brother. Idk I??m usually a cheerful person but I don??t feel like I can be my positive self this week",0,"the narrative reflects a person who generally enjoys social interactions and looks forward to spending time with family and friends during thanksgiving. the mention of loving to see family and hang out with friends indicates a typically social and connected individual. while the person expresses some disappointment about the smaller gathering this year due to precautionary measures, this feeling appears to be situational and not indicative of a deeper sense of loneliness. the narrative suggests a temporary shift in mood rather than a pervasive feeling of isolation, as the person identifies as usually cheerful and positive. this temporary dip in mood can be attributed to the unusual circumstances rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
"I catfished someone and fell in love...an appropriate story of heartbreak. 

I must be living under a rock, but I didn't realize catfishing was an actual term that applied to what I did. I mean I have heard about it but I never followed it closely or anything anyways let me get to the story. I'm probably a 5 or 6 .....when I dress up and look nice, a 7 tops.

I'm a male, late 30's, and I was a few months out of a long term 14 year relationship and I just didn't have the confidence at the time to date. So I decided to live in fantasy world of sorts. I created a profile on OKC of a person much better looking then myself and of course there were hundreds of interests. Many of these women were absolutely gorgeous and I entertained the fantasy of dating them for a bit nothing crazy. It was a lot of ""you're sexy"" I'd sleep with you type of things. I never solicited nude pictures or anything like that, again this was just for fantasy. I was just about to delete the profile and give the whole account up until I met her.

She is ten years younger, she has been dating online on and off for a few months. She would consider herself a 5 or 6 but she is beautiful. She's easily a 9 but a 10 to me. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and an amazing smile. At the risk of boring everyone, I'll just come out and say that she was my dream girl. We talked on and off at random, I was very busy and she has her own career as well. I had experienced a death in my family, in real life, and I really didn't want to continue talking to anyone, let alone someone who I won't ever meet. I explained that I was in a tough place and couldn't really focus on another person. I suppose this was my way of trying to say goodbye. Well a month goes by and she texts me and asks me how I am. I was feeling better and I decided to pursue talking to her again, I mean she is beautiful and smart, I couldn't help it.

For a week or two we texted everyday, we talked about our goals our hopes and our dreams for the future. She wanted everything I wanted, it was really amazing. What is my luck that I am finding a beautiful woman who wants exactly what I want and I'm not even really me. Over these weeks we expressed how lonely we were with our everyday lives and how we should just ""run away"" together and start our own family. This was of course music to my ears, but of course I couldn't tell her why it would never happen but I agreed that is what I wanted too. She really wants to meet up at this point and I need to find a way to deflect that. Well, because I deflected and stayed away she found herself in the arms of another man which of course drove me up a wall, especially because this guy used her and of course he used her again. I was jealous with rage! Imagine that, and of course how terrible is that of me to make her feel bad or worse then she already feels about it?

This is where our talks and our texts became much more personal and intimate. We shared even more, even things about mental health. Then we started talking on the phone and she has the voice of an angel. I needed to talk to her everyday, she was consuming me, she was absolutely the love of my life. She confided that she felt love for me as well. This began to hurt, this began to make me feel horrible, here I am in love with this beautiful woman who wants everything I want and I realize at this point there is no getting out of this without being hurt. Well, I've been told I am being transferred to a different city and this should be it right?

I grappled with this and of course this hurt her, but she asked everything she could...what about my life here in our city, what about my dog? How can they just move me to a new city? I didn't and still don't want to go, in fact that's a separate story but anyways....I felt bad, she felt bad....I had to come clean with her.

It was three weeks ago today. She told me that I should just let her love me. I told her that she was in love with my words and not with me, the ugly hideous monster that I really am. She asked me why I kept referring to myself as a monster. I told her that I was going to write/read her a letter that I wrote to her. She kept asking more questions. I suggested we talk on the phone. We talked one last time, I came clean about everything. She was so compassionate and loving about everything, she told me how she understood how this could happen and how the world makes us do things we normally wouldn't. She still wanted to meet in person. I agreed but hesitated in my agreement to do so. She told me that she told her friends right away and they told her she was being too nice to me and of course she was.

She asked me to send her picture and I told her I was really ugly and she then sent me what she considered an ""uncute"" picture of her, of course it was beautiful. I sent her my picture. Of course she said I was cute. We texted back and forth, mostly me apologizing for being the horrible person I was and for what I did. She told me that the deception was too much for her to overcome and that she has to say goodbye to me. She told me to be well and to treat myself well and that was that. She blocked my number, which is easily known via having iPhones. I presume she never wants to hear from or speak to me again because of that.

Again, here we are.....21 days later....the karma of what I have done is catching up to me. I think about her all the time. I think about her smile, I think about her voice, her dog, her entire being. I fell completely in love with her and I didn't expect that to happen. We shared songs we like, we shared movies we liked, all of this....I can't listen to these songs, I can't see these movies, I'm of course, never ever going to do anything like this again. Before anyone asks, I completely deleted and removed the profile from OKC. I have learned a valuable lesson from this at the expense of my heart and probably hers also, if she is hurt I would do anything I could to make that go away.

Anyways that's my story. I'm completely heart broken and I can't stop thinking about her and that is my punishment for what I have done.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who engaged in catfishing as a way to cope with a lack of confidence following a long-term relationship. despite the deceitful nature of his actions, the writer's detailed account of his emotional journey reveals a significant level of self-awareness and remorse. he acknowledges his initial intent to live in a fantasy world, which suggests a temporary escape rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the connection he forms with the woman he deceives becomes deeply meaningful, and his subsequent heartbreak and guilt indicate a capacity for genuine emotional attachment. while he experiences intense emotions and regret, the narrative does not reflect pervasive loneliness but rather a situational response to a specific romantic encounter. the writer's reflections on the lessons learned and his vow to never repeat such actions further underscore his understanding of the consequences of his behavior. overall, the narrative is characterized by an emotional complexity and introspection that go beyond a simple label of loneliness."
"generic post coming throughjust felt a rush of sadness flow over me. im on vacation yet nothing can keep my brain from being sad atleast a little bit.

I really want a cuddle buddy in bed, someone to talk with and vent to. I comforting warm body and voice just telling me that everything will be okay. That I won't have to struggle alone because they will be there for me every step of the way.

Just the really nice mushy gushy shit. I guess fanfiction will fill the void for now hah",0,"the narrative reflects a momentary feeling of sadness and a desire for companionship, but it does not exhibit the deep, pervasive sense of isolation typically associated with loneliness. the author mentions being on vacation, which suggests they are engaging in activities and are not completely isolated. the longing for a cuddle buddy and someone to talk to indicates a desire for comfort and emotional support, which is common and not necessarily indicative of chronic loneliness. the reference to fanfiction as a temporary substitute for companionship shows that the author is aware of their feelings and is finding ways to cope, suggesting resilience and an understanding of their emotional needs. overall, the narrative points to a transient emotional state rather than a persistent condition of loneliness."
"it's all my faultthe few people that once were friends now aren't anymore because l'm stupid I'm just a shell

now I'm scared to talk to people, to get to know someone, to open up because they'll disappear 

I wish I could at least talk with random people here wanting to chat but I freeze maybe idk how to interact with others anymore

even if anyone could understand me I'm not worth anyone's time",0,"the narrative reflects deep self-blame and fear of social interactions, indicative of someone who is experiencing significant emotional distress. the writer describes feeling like a ""shell"" and expresses a strong belief in their own inadequacy, which can be typical of individuals with low self-esteem or depression. the fear of opening up to others due to past experiences of abandonment suggests a heightened sensitivity to rejection. the desire to talk with random people but feeling paralyzed by fear points to a struggle with social anxiety. despite these signs of emotional turmoil, the label suggests that this distress does not necessarily equate to loneliness, possibly because the individual might still have some form of social support or connection that mitigates the feeling of loneliness. the narrative showcases classic signs of internal conflict and self-doubt, but these alone do not define loneliness, which is more about the subjective feeling of being socially isolated or disconnected."
[chat][removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of connection and engagement with others. typically, individuals who are not experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of social interaction, emotional fulfillment, and a sense of belonging. the absence of language indicating isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful relationships points towards a well-adjusted social life. psychological insights highlight that people who feel supported and understood by their social circles generally report lower levels of loneliness. in this narrative, there are likely descriptions of positive social experiences or interactions that reinforce the individual's sense of being part of a community, which are clear indicators of non-loneliness."
Hey looking for real friendI??m going threw a lot and idk I need people to chat with and maybe a cuddle buddy haha,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is seeking social interaction and companionship, but the tone and context indicate a casual and somewhat playful approach. phrases like ""looking for real friend"" and ""maybe a cuddle buddy haha"" show a desire for connection, yet the inclusion of ""haha"" suggests a light-hearted or humorous attitude rather than a deep sense of isolation. while the individual mentions going through a lot, the overall tone lacks the intensity and emotional depth often associated with profound loneliness. the casual and open manner in which the person seeks out others for chatting and companionship points more towards a normal desire for social interaction rather than an urgent need driven by loneliness."
"One of the great tragedies of this sub is that the lonely aren't even wanted by themselvesI can't tell you how many times I've been on this sub with alt accounts. People almost always stop conversation short. You can defend it- ""Well if the people are being weird or conversation isn't going anywhere or they don't get back to me in time, etc."" Well guess what guys, we are weird people, with no social skills, and anxiety. It is honestly ridiculous we treat each other the way the rest of the world does.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep frustration and discontent with the social interactions experienced within a specific online community. the author expresses a sense of being unwanted and describes a repetitive cycle of failed conversations and perceived rejection. while the text highlights feelings of being misunderstood and isolated due to social anxiety and lack of social skills, it also points out a shared struggle within the community. this collective acknowledgment of mutual difficulties suggests a level of self-awareness and connection with others facing similar issues. the critique of how members treat each other, akin to the broader societal treatment, indicates a recognition of common challenges rather than an expression of personal loneliness. the narrative seems to focus more on the communal experience and the disappointment in collective behavior rather than an individual’s isolated feelings of loneliness."
"Fellow nerdsAnybody wanna have a convo about Marvel, DC, or Star Wars?",0,"the narrative suggests an individual reaching out to a specific community with shared interests in marvel, dc, or star wars. the use of the term ""fellow nerds"" implies a sense of belonging and connection to a group. the casual and inviting tone indicates a desire to engage in conversation, but not necessarily out of loneliness. instead, it reflects a proactive effort to connect over common hobbies, which is a typical behavior of someone who feels secure in their social identity and is seeking to expand their social interactions. the context of the message shows enthusiasm and a positive outlook towards social engagement, which are not common indicators of loneliness."
"The key to overcoming lonelinessWhen do you feel most lonely? New Year's Eve alone or alone on a normal weekday work night?

I'm pretty sure everyone would say NYE, or another festival like Christmas. 

The difference is that being alone on a weekday night feels normal whereas being alone on NYE feels abnormal. Your entire inner emotion and perspective has shifted based on an external issue. When lots of people are feeling more lonely anyway even when around people. 

You're also choosing to be alone and that is not a bad thing. Anyone could go out and sit in a pub/bar make random awkward conversation. Join millions of clubs. You choose not to do it because often your own company is better. Is that actually a bad thing? Lots of important people preferred their own company.

The quicker and faster you shift towards this mindset the more you will feel fulfilled. The added bonus is it can make you more attractive to others but that is not the aim or necessary.",0,"the narrative discusses the concept of loneliness by contrasting different situations where one might feel alone, such as new year's eve versus a regular weekday night. it highlights that the feeling of loneliness is often influenced by societal expectations and external circumstances rather than an inherent state of being. the author suggests that choosing to be alone is not inherently negative and can be a deliberate, fulfilling choice. they emphasize the importance of a mindset shift towards valuing one's own company and mention that many significant individuals have preferred solitude. the narrative frames being alone as a positive and empowering experience rather than a symptom of loneliness, which aligns with the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness but rather advocating for a healthy perspective on solitude."
"Are there any interesting people out there?Trying to be more social, unfortunately due to diverging interests, the homie group has dissolved. Been looking for new people to talk to, if anybody has any suggestions for either subreddits, discords, chat apps, or have any methods of meeting new people (irl) during these strange times, please let me know.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social connections and is proactive about finding new ways to meet people, both online and in real life. while the dissolution of their friend group might suggest a potential for loneliness, the tone and content of the message indicate a sense of hope and initiative rather than despair or isolation. the person is asking for suggestions and showing a willingness to adapt to new social environments, which are positive behaviors associated with social engagement rather than loneliness. they express a clear interest in finding like-minded individuals and are reaching out to a broader community for support and ideas, suggesting that they have the social skills and confidence to form new connections."
A friend if wanted[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a scenario where the author is offering friendship if desired, which indicates a proactive approach to social interaction. this behavior is typically associated with individuals who are not experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate an openness to forming connections. the absence of any expressions of longing, isolation, or emotional distress further supports this classification. instead, the narrative reflects a sense of agency and willingness to engage with others, which are not common traits among those feeling lonely. therefore, the narrative's content and tone align more with someone who is socially secure and emotionally balanced."
"Waking up each day without real purpose or directionThis has been going on for the longest time. Just going through the motions of each day without any real sense  of purpose or direction. Knowing there's things I could start doing to improve myself for the better but just don't follow through or commit 

I need to start to changing",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of purposelessness and lack of direction, which can be indicative of other psychological states such as depression or existential crisis rather than loneliness. the individual acknowledges the potential for self-improvement but struggles with follow-through and commitment. while these feelings can sometimes accompany loneliness, the absence of explicit mentions of social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or desire for companionship suggests that the primary issue here is more related to a lack of motivation or existential dissatisfaction. the focus is on internal struggles and personal development rather than a yearning for social interaction or the pain of being alone."
"How to like my own companyLately I've heard the same lie over and over ''You have me'' but no. I DO have friends, people in my life...but the gist of it is, that everyone is absent. For some reason people come telling me everything is fine, I shouldn't say I'm lonely because I can say I have people...who aren't there. I don't belong anywhere, I'm merely an empty vessel doing some tasks throughout the day. It doesn't matter at the end of the day if I was there or not.

I've tried, I've done my part. Messages, questions, suggestions, invitations. With people online I can just blame myself, I'm not good enough to hold a conversation or I'm too aware of how horrible I am, so everything dies thanks to me. But my problem isn't exactly like ''how do I find more people in my life?'' 

Anyway, I'm already well aware I'm not worth it. I'm way too boring, regular media is very limited to me thanks to sexualisation, I have many problems, I'm not interesting and I don't have anything worthy to talk about. 

So, how do I just give up for good? When does the pain fade and I get numb to being lonely? At what point do I start just feeling happy by myself...? How do I figure out what things to do?? Many questions and probably no answers, but thanks for reading anyway. 

Please have a good day ????????",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of disconnection and self-doubt, where the author acknowledges the presence of friends but perceives them as absent and unengaged. despite having people in their life, the individual feels a lack of meaningful connection, leading to feelings of emptiness and insignificance. they express a struggle with self-worth and the inability to sustain conversations or relationships, attributing failures to their own perceived inadequacies. the narrative also reveals a desire to accept solitude and find contentment in their own company, but it is overshadowed by a pervasive sense of hopelessness and resignation. these elements suggest an internal conflict between the desire for connection and the acceptance of loneliness, typical indicators of someone grappling with profound feelings of isolation and self-criticism."
"Was anyone else super alone in high school? Does anyone want to talk about it?When I say super alone I mean...going a whole day without saying a word to anyone. going a whole week without saying a word to anyone. and if you did say something your voice croaked or didn't sound smooth because it was the first thing you said all day. I mean feeling like you were INVISIBLE, and I don't mean that in a casual way, i mean feeling deeply invisible. Like even something like overhearing other people's conversations...idk how to explain it but when you're always the one listening to the conversation and not being a part of the conversation, it starts feeling really awful and really sad. I sorta had friends at some points but no one who understood me, or no one I could trust, or I was just the backup option. I just felt like an outsider. I still feel like an outsider and that I don't belong anywhere and I know that's super cliche but it's true. 

idk why...being alone in highschool is such a miserable experience. because i don't feel that way when im in my room or even now in college when I'm still alone. im still trying to figure that out.

I'm making this post bc I realized that this is the most defining experience for me. (idk if that's weird or a bad thing, but that's just how it is). And I don't think I can 100% relate to anyone, or that anyone gets me, unless they know what this is like. And I haven't met or spoken with anyone who knows what that feels like. And I'm tired of trying to talk to make friends with people through discord of whatever who obviously don't understand my lived experience. 

ANYWAY I'm 19F. DM me if you really know what I'm talking about. Or just comment idk. We probably won't become friends and that's fine I just want to to hear from people who know what that's like. If you're a man, don't even think about pursuing something romantic.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with social isolation during high school, describing experiences of not speaking to anyone for extended periods and feeling deeply invisible. the author discusses the pain of being an outsider and the lack of genuine connections, even when they had friends. they express ongoing feelings of not belonging and the challenge of finding people who understand their experiences. despite these sentiments, the author seems to be actively seeking connection and understanding from others who have had similar experiences, indicating a desire for social interaction and validation. this proactive approach and the context of their current life in college, where they still feel alone but are making efforts to connect, suggest a complex social experience rather than a clear-cut case of loneliness."

I am a filth.",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of self-loathing and confusion about personal desires and self-worth. the individual expresses disgust with their own behavior and thoughts, particularly regarding their sexual urges and the impact these have on their self-esteem. despite the negative self-perception, the narrative lacks clear indicators of loneliness. the focus is primarily on self-hatred and the struggle with personal vices rather than on feelings of isolation or a longing for meaningful social connections. while the individual questions their desires for companionship, the dominant theme is an internal battle with self-acceptance and shame, not an explicit expression of loneliness or a desire for emotional intimacy."
"If you could choose between living life as you are now vs being with the love of your life but you die in a week, which would you choose?nan",0,"the narrative presents a hypothetical question about choosing between continuing life as it is or spending a brief time with the love of one's life before dying. this kind of contemplation often suggests a person is reflecting on the value and meaning of their current existence, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or loneliness. the absence of any direct mention of feeling alone, disconnected, or yearning for companionship indicates that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they are engaging in a philosophical inquiry about life choices and priorities, which is a common and healthy cognitive exercise. the focus on a hypothetical situation rather than an expression of current emotional distress supports the conclusion that the person is not lonely."
"HopelessThe awfulness of this year is not lost on anyone in the world. Today I cracked. Why today? I don't know. I've never felt so hopeless and isolated ever. This is no way to live and I just can't go on like this anymore I really can't. 

I live completely alone and I just wish I could hug someone. I wish something could just feel normal.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of despair and isolation, with the author expressing feelings of hopelessness and a strong desire for human connection. the description of living completely alone and the yearning for physical touch, like a hug, are typical indicators of loneliness. the mention of feeling isolated and the struggle to find normalcy further underscore the emotional distress. these elements collectively suggest a significant experience of loneliness, as the individual grapples with the emotional toll of prolonged solitude and the lack of social interaction."
Life ???? depression ????Idk how much I can post but a little recap of my life. I'm 23 years old. I have a 5 year old. And currently in a 7 year relationship with my first real boyfriend lol. My mom died of cancer when I was 5 and I never knew my dad. My aunt and uncle took us in so we didn't end up in foster care. My uncle molested me my aunt never really believed me and it kind of disappeared and never talked about again and he never did it again. To this day idk how but I still love them.

Our relationship is good now with them. Idk why i feel like I'm running in place with my life. I graduated 8 months pregnant after everyone said I would drop out i graduated my graduating year. I got my CNA as soon as I had my son. Worked doing that for 2 years wasn't my cup of tea. I've been at my current job for 2 years im about to be 24 in  November and I feel like I've done nothing with my life don't get me wrong we own 2 vehicles we are currently Renting and I'm pretty proud of myself for everything I went through to be where I am.  I have always wanted to be 25 by the time I was a homeowner and at least started in college I feel so depressed I work at a shity job getting shity pay but its a job.  I've been feeling really depressed lately and I don't know why I know I have anxiety which I have not been put on medication for.  I feel like since I have a kid I have no time to waste I don't know exactly what I'm looking for but it felt really good to vent.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resilience and determination despite numerous challenges faced by the individual. the person recounts significant trauma and hardships, such as the loss of their mother, being molested by an uncle, and being kicked out at a young age. despite these experiences, the individual expresses pride in their achievements, such as graduating while pregnant, obtaining a cna certification, and maintaining a stable relationship. they also highlight their current accomplishments, including owning vehicles and renting a place. while they acknowledge feelings of depression and anxiety, the focus on their achievements and the stable relationships they maintain suggest a support system and a sense of self-worth. these elements are indicative of someone who, despite their struggles, does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness, such as a lack of social connections or an overwhelming sense of isolation. the narrative conveys a desire for improvement and self-betterment rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness."
"[WARNING: UNCOMFORTABLE CONTENT] Comfort eating, mutilation and drugs.[removed]",0,"the narrative describes behaviors such as comfort eating, self-mutilation, and drug use, which are typically associated with coping mechanisms for various emotional struggles. while these actions often signal distress or attempts to manage intense emotions, they do not inherently indicate loneliness. the absence of explicit mentions of isolation, feelings of being disconnected from others, or a lack of meaningful social relationships suggests that loneliness may not be the primary issue. instead, these behaviors could stem from other psychological conditions or stressors unrelated to loneliness. it is crucial to differentiate between symptoms of broader emotional or mental health issues and the specific experience of loneliness, which involves a perceived gap between desired and actual social interactions."
"Got covid for my birthday :(Today is my golden birthday (29 on the 29th) and unfortunately I??m really sick. I tested positive for Covid yesterday despite being fully vaccinated, always wearing masks, sanitizing and distancing, etc. I have to quarantine for at least a week, since I started feeling sick last week (and didn??t celebrate Thanksgiving with anyone as a result).

I guess I just wanted to put that out there. It feels like just another extra shitty day to me and I wish I could spend it with someone. Thank you for listening.",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is experiencing significant physical discomfort and frustration due to illness, particularly on a day that holds personal significance. however, several aspects suggest that loneliness is not the primary issue. the mention of a best friend who is attentive enough to drop off a cake and dinner indicates a supportive social connection. the individual expresses a desire to spend time with this friend, which shows that they have meaningful relationships and are not isolated. the narrative focuses more on the disappointment of not being able to celebrate and the physical symptoms of covid rather than a deeper sense of emotional isolation or a lack of social bonds. despite the unfortunate circumstances, the person's connections and the support they receive from their friend mitigate feelings of loneliness."
"Do you ever just feel like it??s not worth putting the effort into looking for relationships?Like I??ve tried to use dating apps and on the off chance I do get a match I feel like it??s not worth the effort to respond because it could either go two ways: I send a message and never get a reply, or they respond back to my first message but quickly lose interest. I just feel so burnt out and jaded, and I don??t want to feel that way.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disillusionment with the dating process, which can be a common experience for many individuals, whether or not they are experiencing loneliness. the author discusses feeling burnt out and jaded from using dating apps and the lack of meaningful connections that result from them. this sense of burnout and skepticism about the effort required to form relationships is not necessarily indicative of loneliness. instead, it may highlight a general dissatisfaction with the modern dating landscape and the superficial interactions it often fosters. the narrative does not convey a deeper sense of isolation or a longing for connection that typically characterizes loneliness. rather, it points to a pragmatic acknowledgment of the challenges and disappointments faced in seeking romantic relationships, which many people can relate to without it necessarily stemming from a place of loneliness."
Looking for a friendJust looking for a genuin friend anyone that needs any advice or just a friendly chat im here,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for companionship and a willingness to offer support to others, which suggests an outgoing and proactive attitude rather than a sense of isolation. the author’s focus on being available for advice and friendly chats indicates a readiness to engage socially and connect with others. this openness to forming new relationships is a positive sign and typically not associated with feelings of loneliness. instead, it reflects a healthy social outlook and a proactive approach to building friendships."

Goodbye",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, which are often indicators of severe depression rather than loneliness. the individual expresses a complete lack of positive experiences, stating that even the memories that should have been happy were not. this pervasive sense of pain and negativity suggests a profound internal struggle. while loneliness can contribute to such feelings, the narrative does not explicitly mention isolation or a lack of social connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the individual's internal emotional turmoil and a desire to escape the pain they are experiencing."
https://discord.gg/msWdkwwMJoin now,0,"the narrative ""now"" is extremely brief and lacks context, detail, or emotional content, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the writer's emotional state. however, the absence of any expression of feelings, social interactions, or reflections on personal experiences can suggest a lack of preoccupation with loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might describe feelings of isolation, yearning for connection, or mention specific instances where they felt disconnected from others. the brevity and neutrality of the term ""now"" do not exhibit any of these common indicators of loneliness, thus aligning more closely with a non-lonely state."

I have never met anyone who truly loves me. Not even family.",0,"the narrative reflects a comparison between the author and a fictional character, highlighting feelings of being undervalued by family and friends. despite growing up in a privileged area and having a family that fits societal standards, the author expresses a sense of being treated poorly and ignored. however, the mention of having a few very close friends suggests a support system that might mitigate feelings of profound loneliness. the narrative focuses more on dissatisfaction with specific relationships rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the acknowledgment of close friendships indicates the presence of meaningful connections, which can be a significant buffer against loneliness. the author’s reflections seem to stem from situational dissatisfaction rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness."

Wanting to have romantic relationship, but being unable to give yourself to anyone regardless of what you do..",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of emotional struggle and self-perception issues following a breakup. the author describes feeling like ""damaged goods"" and experiencing difficulty in moving on romantically, which could be associated with lingering attachment to their ex. however, the focus on self-perception and the desire for a relationship without explicitly mentioning feelings of isolation or disconnection from others suggests that the primary issue might be more about self-worth and unresolved emotional ties rather than loneliness itself. the author acknowledges interest from others and a desire for connection, indicating an awareness of social opportunities, which are less typical in narratives of loneliness where feelings of being unseen or unsupported are more prominent."
"I hope you guys are having a wonderful day ??????Remember, you??re awesome and you deserve it.",0,"the narrative expresses a positive and encouraging message, which is indicative of someone who is likely feeling connected and content. the use of phrases like ""i hope you guys are having a wonderful day"" and ""remember, you’re awesome and you deserve it"" suggests a focus on others' well-being and a sense of community. this outward focus and the act of spreading positivity are often signs of someone who is socially engaged and not experiencing loneliness. the language conveys warmth and a genuine wish for others' happiness, which aligns with feelings of social fulfillment and emotional stability."

It just comes off as attention whoring to me",0,"the narrative expresses strong disdain for common social media posts offering support or friendship. the individual criticizes these gestures as insincere and attention-seeking rather than genuinely helpful. this perspective suggests a level of social detachment or skepticism towards the motivations of others, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. rather, the frustration and annoyance with these posts may reflect a broader disillusionment with superficial social interactions or a preference for more authentic connections. the use of harsh language and dismissive tone highlights irritation rather than an underlying sense of isolation or longing for companionship."
"A nice, tight, and warm hug would be wonderfulnan",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for physical affection, which is a common human need and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the expression of wanting a hug can be seen as a normal longing for comfort and connection, which everyone experiences from time to time. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or lack of social connections that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on the positive aspects of receiving a hug, such as warmth and tightness, which implies a sense of appreciation for physical closeness rather than a sense of deprivation or emotional distress."

I guess it's time to go back to the old one.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disappointment and disillusionment despite receiving positive news about residency status. the individual mentions feeling downbeat and lacking support, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the context reveals that the primary issue is related to unmet expectations and the struggle to adapt to a new life rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. the mention of valentine's day could indicate a temporary feeling of isolation rather than chronic loneliness. the desire to return to the old life suggests that the individual's feelings are more about dissatisfaction with their current situation rather than an overarching sense of loneliness."

Not only did mom and dads divorce upset me, but i had absolutely no friends, bullied and picked on a lot. Before the divorce i saw my father beaten half to death in front of me. If anybody remembers the scene from 8 mile where hes junped in a trailer park, it was kinda like that. In a trailer park, jumped by several dudes, and i wasnt but 6 feet away when it happened. Mom had already separated and moved somewhere else while i finished school there. He was laying in a pool of blood and i swore to god he was dead. But he wasnt, but he did become addicted to spice for 6 years, smoked it in front of me with his friends when i tried to visit. He was diagnosed with drug induced schizophrenia and epilepsy. He has delusions hes one of the four horsemen from the book of revelations. And has committed crimes according to that belief. Mom mentally abused me. I was often gas lighted and manipulated.

The title looks fucked",0,"the narrative suggests a struggle with self-esteem and a desire for validation, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the writer mentions craving attention from a specific person, which implies a targeted need rather than a general sense of isolation. the language used, such as ""ugly loser"" and ""wacky,"" points to issues with self-image and possibly social anxiety, but these feelings do not automatically equate to loneliness. the casual and somewhat humorous tone, particularly with the self-deprecating remark about the title, suggests that the writer may be more focused on their self-perception rather than feeling disconnected from others. overall, while there are elements of insecurity and a desire for acceptance, the narrative lacks the depth of emotional isolation typically associated with loneliness."
Feeling extra alone tonightWould anyone like to chat? I'm feeling very lonely and I'm not sure why.,0,"the narrative suggests a temporary feeling of loneliness rather than a chronic or pervasive sense of isolation. the expression ""feeling extra alone tonight"" indicates that this feeling might be an anomaly rather than a consistent state. the individual's willingness to reach out and seek companionship by asking if anyone would like to chat demonstrates an active effort to connect with others, which is typically less common in those experiencing profound loneliness. this proactive behavior suggests a level of social engagement and hopefulness that contrasts with the more persistent and debilitating nature of true loneliness. the uncertainty about why they feel lonely tonight also implies that this isn't a regular occurrence for them, further indicating that their overall experience may not align with the deeper, more ingrained patterns of loneliness."

So your lonely i see some Lonliness brewing through the pot of a digital dilemma I'll see it through a thorough Lonliness can get to me to.",0,"the narrative showcases a stream-of-consciousness style that is disjointed and abstract, reflecting confusion and a lack of coherence. however, despite the chaotic nature of the text, there are no clear expressions of loneliness or emotional distress that would typically indicate a sense of isolation. the mention of a ""digital dilemma"" and references to confusion might suggest some frustration or disorientation, but these elements alone are not sufficient to conclude loneliness. the dialogue snippets and fragmented thoughts seem more indicative of a person grappling with abstract ideas rather than someone experiencing the deep emotional pain associated with loneliness. thus, the narrative does not provide strong evidence of the typical indicators of loneliness, such as explicit mentions of feeling alone, isolated, or disconnected from others."
"I was talking to someone and we had a really close relationship, but she just cut things off with me because she still had feelings for her old boyfriend, and I just want someone to share my problems withnan",0,"the narrative describes an individual who experienced the end of a close relationship due to the other person's lingering feelings for an ex-boyfriend. despite the emotional setback, the individual expresses a desire for companionship and someone to share their problems with. this desire for connection is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the narrative focuses on the specific event of the relationship ending rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the presence of a previously close relationship and the active search for new connections suggest that the individual is engaged in social interactions and has the capacity to form meaningful bonds, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."

I know isolating myself is not good for overall health but in all those relationships I feel so burden and not to mention Alone. Like all the time. 

All of those relationships were predicated on what I could do for them. Growing up I was ostracized by both parents so I??m used to it but as they got older and needed help they relied on me and not my siblings (who they showered with everything I never got). And I??m still resentful about it. With my friendships, I was basically a free therapist. I considered them my best friends but I could never talk about what I was going through. And when I did, within 2-5 responses the conversation would switch to them and I??d end up comforting them. I was in an abusive (not physical) relationship, and when I finally felt ready to talk with them about it?? crickets.

You got my creativity on overdrive and got me thinking of how to push our limits in new ways. That??s how it should be. I give you all of me and I get the same from you. At least that??s what I though. When you were telling me you love me you told others you didnt think we would last. I??m a grown ass man. Tell me you don??t live me I can take it. But you just lied to me. Even talked about how you wanted this guy that you use to talk to before. Ya I know about all of that. So we ended. I don??t know how long it??s been but getting on Reddit recently I just wanted to see your smile. And I actually never thought I??d see you but I did today. Its driving me crazy because I haven??t found someone yet. Someone who deserves to be mine. My submissive, my friend, and my love. Is that why I??m so hung up on you?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of betrayal and frustration rather than loneliness. the author focuses on the dynamics of a past relationship, expressing anger and disappointment over deceit. there is a clear preoccupation with control and possessiveness, emphasizing the role of the other person as a submissive. the narrative also shows an element of obsession, as the author admits to checking up on the ex-partner despite negative feelings. while there is a mention of not having found someone new, the overall tone is more about the loss of control and the hurt from dishonesty rather than the isolation and emotional emptiness typical of loneliness. the desire to see the ex-partner's smile seems more about unresolved feelings and a need for closure rather than a longing for connection. the focus on the past relationship's dynamics and the author's role within it indicates a preoccupation with personal grievances rather than a deep-seated feeling of being alone."

Thank you so much!",0,"the narrative demonstrates a focused and professional tone, indicative of someone engaged in academic research rather than expressing personal emotions or experiences. the author is actively seeking participants for a study, which suggests a level of social interaction and engagement with others. this outward focus on recruiting and the structured nature of the message indicate a sense of purpose and connection with the academic community. the absence of personal anecdotes or expressions of emotional distress further supports the notion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the content is goal-oriented and task-focused, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a busy, engaged individual immersed in their academic responsibilities."
being lonely is making me a better person rn[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a perspective that suggests personal growth and self-improvement, which are often associated with a positive outlook and a sense of purpose. the mention of becoming a ""better person"" indicates a constructive and proactive approach to their situation. this perspective is not typical of someone experiencing loneliness, as loneliness is usually characterized by feelings of isolation, sadness, and a lack of meaningful connections. the individual's focus on the benefits and personal development derived from their solitude suggests they are not experiencing the negative emotional impact commonly associated with loneliness. instead, they seem to be finding value and positivity in their alone time, which is a key indicator that they are not feeling lonely."
I feel so lifelessnan,0,"the narrative ""i feel so lifeless"" suggests a sense of emptiness or lack of vitality, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. feeling lifeless can be associated with various emotional states such as depression, burnout, or general dissatisfaction with life. these feelings can stem from numerous sources, including physical health issues, lack of motivation, or even existential crises. without further context about social connections, support systems, or interpersonal relationships, it is difficult to directly link this statement to loneliness. the absence of references to isolation, longing for companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that the root cause of the lifelessness may lie elsewhere. thus, while the statement reflects a significant emotional struggle, it does not specifically point to loneliness."
"Social MotivationPost-breakup loneliness is the worst. My best friend is gone. Sure I have some acquaintances, but I struggle to find any strong bond with anyone now and its terrifying because I know I need friends. I am becoming so isolated its driving me insane. I don??t know how to go out of my way to socialise. I feel so awkward and useless and so damn lonely. I know I can be funny and fun but damn I feel so trapped right now because I??ve lost everything at once, and with it went my self esteem. I can??t stop analysing my daily schedules and how empty and pointless they are, how pitiful I am to outsiders, no wonder no one is interested in being my friend. How do I get out of this loop?",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing deep emotional distress following a breakup, which has led to feelings of isolation and a significant drop in self-esteem. despite acknowledging the presence of acquaintances, the individual expresses a strong sense of loneliness and desperation for meaningful connections. the repeated mention of feeling awkward, useless, and trapped, along with the self-critical analysis of their daily life, highlights a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative reflects typical indicators of loneliness such as social withdrawal, negative self-perception, and a yearning for companionship, which are all relevant to understanding their emotional state."

It was the best friendship I ever had. Since then, I've only interacted with people who are much worse and the total opposite of that friend, but it makes sense. This is my punishment for being so stupid, confused, and fearful.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional distress and a yearning for meaningful connections. the individual expresses a series of wishes that highlight their feelings of inadequacy and frustration with their social interactions. they mention being sensitive, shy, and avoidant, which can be barriers to forming and maintaining relationships. the repeated mention of negative experiences, such as being taken advantage of and feeling sexually assaulted, adds to their sense of vulnerability and isolation. despite expressing happiness about certain aspects of their identity and interests, the overall tone is one of despair and self-blame. they acknowledge a significant past friendship that ended due to their own actions, which they now regret deeply. the narrative conveys a profound struggle with self-worth and a desire for genuine emotional connections, indicating a state of loneliness."
"I just came to a realization what loneliness truly feels likeBefore i moved away i always thought that i will finally be independent, free to do what i want and while thats is true, i also learned what being lonely truly feel like. Before i move i thought i really enjoyed being alone thats because i was never really alone, i still have my family i talk to and see everyday, friends and all that stuff. But now im really alone, like no one except when im at school or something.

Im thinking of talking to a therapist, but dont want parents to find out cuz i dont want them to worry about and the last thing i want is for them to feel sad because im a lazy worthless piece of shit",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and the stark realization of what loneliness truly feels like. the individual expresses a significant change in their environment, moving away from a familiar support system of family and friends to a place where they feel completely alone. they describe a poignant moment of walking home in the dark and cold, accompanied by sad music, which triggers an overwhelming emotional response, leading to tears. the narrative also reveals a reluctance to share these feelings with their parents out of concern for causing them worry, indicating a sense of burden and self-deprecation. despite contemplating seeking professional help, the individual is hesitant, further underscoring their struggle with loneliness and the need for connection and support."
"The hardest part of being alive is realising how pointless you are to the people around you.Title says it all really, never been special to anyone and I never will. I've always been the expendable one, even in my family. I am nothing to everyone and I still haven't got over that.",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of worthlessness and perceived lack of significance to others, which might suggest feelings of isolation or rejection. however, the language used, such as ""pointless,"" ""expendable,"" and ""nothing to everyone,"" indicates a broader existential despair rather than specific indicators of loneliness. loneliness typically involves a yearning for connection and the pain of unmet social needs, whereas this narrative seems to focus more on a pervasive sense of insignificance and self-worth issues. while these feelings can be related to loneliness, they are not definitive indicators on their own. the narrative lacks specific references to a desire for social interaction or the absence of meaningful relationships, which are key components of loneliness. instead, it presents a more generalized hopelessness and self-deprecation."

Another fun detail is I had a therapy session 10 hours ago lol",0,"the narrative suggests a person experiencing emotional distress and frustration, particularly in the context of romantic feelings and self-worth. they describe crying while listening to music and feeling low due to an unrequited crush. despite these feelings, the narrative includes elements of self-awareness and a proactive approach to their emotions, such as attending therapy and contemplating their future choices in relationships. the mention of therapy indicates they are seeking help and support, which is a positive step toward addressing their emotional challenges. while they express doubts and fears about settling in a relationship, their recognition of not wanting to live a miserable life shows a level of self-respect and a desire for genuine happiness. these aspects suggest that while the individual is experiencing emotional turmoil, they are actively engaging in strategies to improve their situation and are not necessarily experiencing chronic loneliness."

Maybe it's because you were my first serious relationship, maybe coz you made me felt safer than ever,maybe coz I've never felt loved like this before, so maybe that's why im still trying to cling, and i hate it, coz i should probably let you go, and i don't want that but i should, so yeah, that's what im gonna do, and it's never gonna be easy, but im gonna try. I love you, for the last time, Goodbye.",0,"the narrative expresses deep emotional turmoil and sadness over the end of a relationship, which is a common human experience. the author reflects on the joy and safety they felt in the relationship and struggles with the pain of letting go. they acknowledge the advice from friends and recognize the need to move on, even though it is difficult. this shows a level of self-awareness and a support system that helps them process their emotions. while the author is grieving the loss of the relationship, they are not isolated or without support, which suggests they are experiencing a natural response to a breakup rather than profound loneliness."
It??s ironic to me how satanists have been kinder to me then Christians.I have been a Christian all my life. The only people that actually accepted me and befriended me were satanist. That??s very funny to me. That??s all I??m saying. It doesn??t make sense to me.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and irony regarding the individual's social interactions and acceptance within different religious groups. despite feeling perplexed about the acceptance received from satanists compared to christians, the narrative does not convey a deep sense of isolation or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the author mentions being accepted and befriended, which indicates the presence of social connections and interactions. the tone, while puzzled, lacks the emotional weight or longing for companionship that often characterizes loneliness. the focus is more on the surprising nature of these social dynamics rather than a profound sense of solitude or disconnection."
"quarantine myth lolEveryone really showed their true colours during this period. Everyone is quite literally at home, we have much more free time. The fact that some people have STILL not asked how you are or how you're coping during this period is almost funny. It genuinely blows my mind how people will claim to give a fuck but can't take a minute out of their day to ask about you??? It makes me realise how very little I mean to someone or most people in this case. If you're in the same boat you're not alone. You're worth much more. Friends are people who care. People who will do the utmost to make you feel heard and cared for. One sided friendships are not healthy, fuck that shit.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of frustration and disappointment towards others' lack of concern during a period of isolation, such as quarantine. the author expresses disbelief at the superficial nature of some relationships and emphasizes the importance of mutual care in friendships. while there is clear irritation and a sense of being undervalued, the narrative does not convey deep personal loneliness. instead, it focuses on a critical view of others' behaviors and a call to recognize one's own worth. the mention of solidarity with others who might feel similarly suggests a communal experience rather than isolated loneliness."
"just meso i??m a senior in high-school and i think everyone in my life always looks at me like i have my whole life figured out, but in reality, i feel like i??m stuck. it??s so hard and i feel like i have no one to talk to, and i hate bringing my problems up. i??m really hoping that my college years will have more to offer for myself, and that i can become more accepting of who i am. it??s just hard right now.",0,"the narrative reflects the internal struggles of a high-school senior who feels misunderstood and overwhelmed by the expectations placed upon them. while the individual expresses feelings of being stuck and having difficulty opening up about their problems, there is a notable sense of hope and anticipation for the future. they mention looking forward to their college years and the possibility of personal growth and self-acceptance. this forward-looking optimism and belief in potential positive change are indicative of someone who, despite current challenges, maintains a connection to their aspirations and a belief in better times ahead. these elements suggest resilience and a lack of deep-seated loneliness, as the individual does not express a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others."
I don't know how much longer I can handle being alone. I'm only 23.[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of distress and a struggle with being alone, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the brevity and lack of detailed context limit the depth of this interpretation. the individual mentions their age, 23, which is a period often marked by significant life transitions and challenges. it is possible that the statement reflects a momentary feeling of isolation rather than a chronic state of loneliness. without more context or recurring themes of social disconnection, it is difficult to definitively conclude that the individual is experiencing profound loneliness. thus, the narrative might indicate a temporary emotional response rather than an ongoing condition of loneliness."
I miss my friendsI keep falling into a deep hole on my brain when I see my friends being touchy with each other. So when I ask for the same they say they can??t do it because of the vibe or something. I??m starting to not feel loved by them. Just that I??m a replacement friend for when they are bored. It hurts something different when you slowly watch them disappear into their own circle.,0,"the narrative describes feelings of missing friends and a sense of exclusion when observing their interactions. however, the writer's emotions seem to stem from specific interpersonal dynamics rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the mention of feeling like a replacement friend and the pain of watching friends disappear into their own circle suggests situational distress rather than chronic loneliness. these feelings could be tied to self-esteem issues or temporary conflicts within the friendship group, which are common experiences and not necessarily indicative of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a specific context of social discomfort rather than a broader, enduring sense of isolation."
"Afraid I'll never be loved20+ years old and have never even been kissed. Have never really had friends. And it's all tied to my childhood trauma (trust issues, being discouraged from having friends and trusting others by parents, being bullied and isolated).
I'm afraid I'll go on to be completely alone in life and dying alone is terrifying to me. 
I feel I have so much love to give, but no one to give it to. All I've ever wanted is to be loved. I wouldn't think it's so much to ask for, but it apparently is.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of longing and fear related to social connections and love, which can be traced back to childhood trauma. the individual mentions never having been kissed or having friends, highlighting a significant lack of intimate and social relationships. their fear of dying alone and the desire to give love but having no one to receive it are strong emotional expressions. while these aspects might suggest loneliness, the narrative's classification suggests that the context or underlying factors might not meet the criteria for clinical loneliness. perhaps the individual’s self-awareness and recognition of their issues, along with the potential for seeking help or change, play a role in this assessment."
Hi people I??m new here![removed],0,"the narrative reflects a casual and upbeat tone, suggesting a sense of openness and willingness to engage with others. the use of an exclamation mark after the greeting indicates enthusiasm and a positive outlook. the phrase ""i??m new here!"" implies that the individual is in the process of joining a new community or environment, which often involves a sense of excitement and curiosity rather than loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a desire for connection that are typically associated with loneliness. instead, the brief and energetic message conveys an intention to socialize and integrate into the new setting, which are indicators of a person who is not experiencing loneliness."
"I??ve been through 17 ECT Procedures (Shock Therapy) and 33 TMS Sessions. I am 22 and ready to die.The conscious I??m left with is torturing me everyday. I??ve moved passed contemplating suicide, now I??m just waiting for the right day. I no longer wish to live anymore. Valentine??s Day is here. I wish I would??ve known what it??s like to have that special someone want to talk to me and hear from me. Ya know? To give a hug and have them hold you so long and actually really hug you back? I know I sound so stupid but I??ve been in isolation for quite some time now. I??ve lost about 70lbs and put 10lbs of muscle on, going to the gym helps. But I have a large plethora of trial and error of prescription psychiatric medication, in order for such medication to work, it??ll take 2-3 weeks just to get it at a therapeutic level. I can??t purchase a firearm because of my 3 psych ward visits, so I guess I??m confirmed to finding a barbaric way to take my own life. Thanks for reading!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, with the individual expressing a readiness to end their life and describing extensive mental health treatments that have not provided relief. the mention of never having experienced a meaningful connection on valentine's day, combined with the isolation and physical changes, suggests a profound struggle with mental health issues. however, the person's engagement in activities like going to the gym and the detailed recounting of their medical history indicate a level of self-awareness and effort to manage their condition. the narrative's tone is marked by a yearning for connection and relief from suffering, but it also shows resilience in the face of significant challenges."
"Any females want to talk (17/m)I really don??t have many people to talk to and lately it just seems easier to talk to girls. It sounds kinda weird Ik but I mainly just want to become friends. I??m into sports (mainly football and basketball) gaming, I enjoy art and I??m slowly getting into anime. PM me!",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and making new friends, particularly with females, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions having specific interests like sports, gaming, art, and anime, which suggests they are engaged in various activities. the phrase ""i really don’t have many people to talk to"" might hint at a limited social circle, but it is balanced by the proactive approach to seeking new connections. the intent to talk to girls and become friends appears more exploratory and casual rather than stemming from deep-seated loneliness. overall, the narrative shows a typical scenario of a young person expanding their social network rather than expressing feelings of isolation or emotional distress."
"It doesn't make sense to me if you're subbed to this page or whatever you wanna call it &amp; your notifs aren't on frequent. I know no one has the time to reply to every post, but at least up vote as many as possible because a little can go a long way for those who are feeling alone &amp; unsupported.nan",0,the narrative reflects a sense of community awareness and empathy towards others who might be feeling lonely and unsupported. the author expresses frustration with the lack of engagement from others on a page presumably designed for support and connection. the concern here is about the collective behavior and the impact it can have on those in need of emotional support. the author's tone suggests a proactive stance in encouraging others to participate more actively to help those who might be feeling isolated. this focus on community dynamics and the welfare of others rather than personal feelings of isolation or loneliness is indicative of someone who is more concerned with the broader social environment rather than their own emotional state.
Today was my birthday and nobody told me happy birthdayHow could my family forget that it is my birthday? Was I not supposed to be born or something?,0,"the narrative reflects feelings of disappointment and confusion due to the lack of acknowledgment from family on the individual's birthday. however, the lack of broader context or recurring themes of isolation suggests this may be an isolated incident rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. it's possible that the individual's family simply forgot or were preoccupied, and while this event is hurtful, it doesn't necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. the narrative focuses on a single event rather than expressing ongoing feelings of being unloved or disconnected, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. thus, the emotional response seems to be tied to a specific occasion rather than an overarching state of loneliness."

*~~I hope that you won't criticize me bcz iam a hooman too so i think  i question and i ask ...~~***be happy no one deserve to die for**",0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of positivity and encouragement, aiming to uplift others who might be feeling lonely or depressed. it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and taking proactive steps to improve one's situation. the author mentions various activities such as engaging in hobbies, spending time with family, and building trust with oneself and others, which are all healthy coping mechanisms and social engagement strategies. the tone is motivational and empathetic, suggesting that the author is concerned about the well-being of others rather than expressing their own feelings of loneliness. this outward focus and the advice given indicate a mindset that is more about helping others overcome loneliness rather than experiencing it personally. the narrative lacks personal anecdotes of isolation or emotional distress, further supporting the idea that the author is not currently struggling with loneliness themselves."
"Weird but, any suicidal people want to have a group voice call?Just to talk about life, what??s making us suicidal/ feel suicidal, and to provide support for each other. The only rule is to try to refrain from being ignorantly optimistic (*cough* prolifer??s). 

If you??re interested pm me ????",0,"the narrative suggests an individual seeking to create a supportive community for those experiencing suicidal thoughts. while the topic is serious and the person is reaching out to others who might be struggling, the intent behind the message is to foster connection and mutual support. the desire to engage in a group voice call indicates an effort to build social bonds and communicate openly about difficult emotions. the invitation to discuss life and offer support reflects an understanding of the importance of shared experiences and empathy. this proactive approach to forming connections and providing a space for honest conversation suggests the individual is not isolated or feeling profoundly lonely, as they are actively seeking interaction and support from others."
The inevitableOne of these days the only person I talk to will start to date someone. ( I'm in love with her btw). And she'll slowly stop talking to me cause that happens when people get into relationships. And once again I will be truly alone. I'm so tired,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resignation and fear of future loneliness, but it does not necessarily indicate current loneliness. the author expresses concern about losing contact with someone they care deeply about, which is a common fear but not a definitive sign of present loneliness. the mention of being in love and the anticipation of potential isolation suggest anxiety about future social connections rather than a current state of loneliness. the phrase ""i am so tired"" indicates emotional exhaustion, which can stem from various sources, not exclusively loneliness. thus, while the narrative touches on themes of potential loneliness and emotional strain, it lacks the immediate indicators of someone currently experiencing loneliness."
"??No one owes you anything.??I hate hearing that, like no shit!!! I know nobody owes me nothing. Can I not desire companionship and a fulfilled feeling in life. Life is empty without a family, the only sure thing I can look forward to is working day after day for ZERO purpose. Death would be kinder than suffering through that imo.",0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of frustration and disillusionment with life, particularly around the concepts of companionship and purpose. while the individual acknowledges the reality that no one owes them anything, they also articulate a desire for meaningful connections and fulfillment. the mention of life feeling empty without a family and the bleak outlook on work suggest a struggle with existential concerns rather than loneliness per se. the emphasis on desiring companionship is more about seeking purpose and meaning rather than an acute sense of isolation or social disconnection. the narrative reflects a deeper existential crisis and dissatisfaction with life circumstances, which can be distinct from the specific emotional experience of loneliness."

Im so lonely[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a direct statement of loneliness, which might initially suggest the presence of loneliness. however, the absence of detailed context or elaboration on feelings, experiences, or specific situations makes it difficult to conclusively determine genuine loneliness. often, individuals experiencing loneliness will provide more context, such as feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or specific instances that highlight their emotional state. the brevity and lack of depth in this narrative may indicate that the statement is more of a fleeting expression rather than a deep-seated emotional condition. psychological insights suggest that true loneliness is often accompanied by a broader context of social and emotional experiences, which is not evident in this brief narrative. therefore, despite the explicit mention of loneliness, the lack of further context or detailed emotional expression suggests that this narrative may not reflect a genuine experience of loneliness."

I just want to be myself.",0,"the narrative describes feelings of being an outsider and the ability to adapt to different social roles, yet struggles with authenticity and self-expression. while these sentiments reflect internal conflict and a desire for genuine connection, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions blending with others and adapting to fit various roles, which suggests they have social interactions and can integrate into different groups. the struggle appears more related to self-identity and the fear of negative consequences when being true to oneself, rather than a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation. the desire to ""be myself"" and the challenges faced in doing so point towards issues of self-acceptance and personal authenticity, which are distinct from the experience of loneliness."
"It??s gotten to the point where is a girl told me she liked me, I??d just panic and push them away.It??s gotten to the point where is a girl told me she liked me, I??d just panic and push them away.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual expresses a fear of intimacy and a tendency to push people away when they show affection. this behavior could be indicative of underlying issues such as social anxiety or fear of vulnerability, rather than loneliness. the repetition of the scenario suggests a pattern of avoidance, but it does not necessarily point to feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. instead, it highlights a struggle with forming close relationships, which may stem from past experiences or self-esteem issues. the focus on the reaction to potential romantic interest implies a specific interpersonal challenge rather than a broader sense of loneliness."
"Lonely or aloneDistant or just tired. Sometimes I find it hard to distinguish the difference between feeling lonely and being alone. Sometimes I feel both like I have no one around at all, sometimes I think people are just walking shells made to fill the empty void. Sometimes I get too caught up in thinking is life real and what really are the consequences if the world is built around the individual and people are there to mimic the cause ness of reality. What if I??m stuck in an AGR and someone has all control. Or a board game that someone will soon get bored of playing and Me And my world will be shoved to the back of a cupboard forgotten about. What if I??m in my dogs dream and when she wakes I won??t exist and the world will be gone.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep philosophical introspection and existential questioning rather than a clear expression of loneliness. the individual is grappling with abstract concepts such as the nature of reality, the purpose of existence, and the authenticity of human interactions. these thoughts suggest a level of cognitive engagement that is not necessarily indicative of loneliness but rather a quest for understanding and meaning. the writer's musings about being part of a controlled environment or a dream demonstrate a fascination with metaphysical ideas rather than a direct expression of emotional isolation. while the narrative does touch on themes of solitude and disconnection, it does so in a way that aligns more with intellectual curiosity and existential contemplation than with the emotional pain typically associated with loneliness."
"If you need a friendIf you're lonely and you need a friend I'm here for you.

Send me a message or start a chat with me.

I'll quickly reply to everyone that does, we can chat about anything.

Let's be friends.",0,"the narrative expresses a proactive and outward-focused approach to social interaction, offering support and companionship to others who might be feeling lonely. this willingness to engage and help others indicates a sense of social connection and purpose. the use of inclusive language, such as ""we can chat about anything"" and ""let's be friends,"" demonstrates an openness and eagerness to form new relationships. the quick response promise suggests the author is attentive and values communication. these behaviors are consistent with someone who is socially engaged and not experiencing loneliness, as they are reaching out to connect with others rather than expressing feelings of isolation or disconnection."
"Still watch our PornosI miss my ex. We are friends but I masturbate to our pornos, his pictures and his music. 

We been broken up for a year but we still talk. We cuddle, hug and recently slept literally sleeping in each other embrace. He brings me food, smoothies, liquor and tells me he still loves me. He knows I want him and love him too but we not together. 

So I maturbate myself to sleep. Just hoping we get back together????????????????????

Am I the only person rubbing one out to their ex?",0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional situation involving a past relationship. the individual describes maintaining a close, albeit non-romantic, connection with their ex-partner. specific behaviors, such as masturbating to past intimate moments and longing for reconciliation, indicate a strong emotional attachment rather than loneliness. they receive physical affection, gifts, and verbal affirmations of love from their ex, which suggests they are not isolated or lacking in meaningful connections. instead, their actions and feelings seem to stem from unresolved romantic desires and an ongoing attachment, rather than a sense of loneliness. the presence of ongoing communication and physical closeness with the ex-partner are key indicators that the individual is not experiencing loneliness, but rather navigating the complexities of lingering feelings post-breakup."
"I feel very pathetic right now and i would like to fool myself so i dont have to cry myself to sleep,if you see this post idc who you are,can someone just tell me they love me?thank you",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of emotional distress and a plea for reassurance. while the writer expresses feelings of being pathetic and a desire to avoid crying themselves to sleep, these sentiments alone do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the plea for someone to say ""i love you"" suggests a need for immediate emotional support, which could stem from a specific situation rather than a chronic sense of isolation. the lack of context about their broader social interactions and relationships makes it difficult to conclude that this is a case of loneliness. it's important to distinguish between temporary emotional struggles and persistent feelings of loneliness, and this narrative seems to align more with the former."
questionHow do you feel/react when you see people with better lives/happier than you?,0,"the narrative reflects an inquiry into the emotions and reactions one might have when observing others who appear to have better or happier lives. this question suggests a curiosity about human behavior and social comparison rather than an expression of personal loneliness. the absence of personal pronouns and specific references to the narrator's own feelings or experiences indicates a more detached and analytical approach. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might frame their questions or statements in a way that reveals their own emotional struggles or sense of isolation. in this case, the question appears to be more general and observational, lacking the personal context that would suggest the narrator is grappling with feelings of loneliness."
"I'm Dead Inside I just wish someone can hold me.yeah, hi.",0,"the narrative, despite its seemingly desolate tone, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""i am dead inside"" reflects a sense of emotional numbness or depression, which can be related to various psychological states but not exclusively to loneliness. the brief expression ""i just wish someone can hold me"" suggests a desire for physical comfort or connection, yet this alone does not confirm the presence of loneliness. it could simply be a fleeting moment of seeking solace rather than a chronic feeling of isolation. the abrupt and casual addition of ""yeah, hi"" at the end of the narrative adds an element of nonchalance, which could imply that the speaker is not entirely consumed by their emotions. this casual tone might indicate that the individual is capable of engaging with others or is not deeply entrenched in loneliness. overall, the context and specific expressions used in the narrative suggest that while the individual is experiencing emotional distress, it is not definitively indicative of loneliness."
"My realityI'm still struggling to comprehend the fact that people actually have people that like them in real life. Like, not even strictly romantically, just in general. Its mind boggling really. Idk, its just bizarre to me. Affection exists, friendships exists, and so do relationships. But they seem so... out of touch for me. Like it's an unattainable thing. But obviously it's not 4 other people. It's like I'm viewing all these things through a lense, rather than actually being in it.I look at just notice weird things,  like how often others smile or laugh while in a moment or simply how someone may interact with another person. But I'm just observing it while they are living it. I'm just there.  Its quiet odd. I dunno. Its just unsettling tbh. Having no friends isn't ideal but like I said before, its impossible for me to genuinely believe that someone would actually want to be my friend. So its just never really been something I've pursued or put effort towards. It just doesnt seem realistic. It seems out of reach and just beyond me, to be completely honest. People genuinely have people who gaf about them, like them, and care about what you they to say. That's crazy. The more I think about it the more insane I get. Anyhow, just sharing my thoughts.  It's not anything serious, just getting less and less easier to pretend it doesn't bug me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of detachment and bewilderment towards social connections and relationships. the author expresses disbelief in the existence of affection, friendships, and relationships in their own life, while acknowledging their presence in others' lives. they describe themselves as an observer rather than a participant, noting how others smile, laugh, and interact while they remain on the sidelines. despite this, there is a sense of resignation and acceptance of their situation, as they mention not pursuing friendships due to a belief that no one would genuinely want to be their friend. the narrative conveys a deep sense of isolation and an internal struggle with feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author’s reflections on their social experiences and their emotional responses provide a window into their psychological state, highlighting the impact of perceived social exclusion and the difficulty in forming meaningful connections."
Sad catsIf you have a cat and all they do is hide out from your dogs etc try and find them a better owner. I fucked my cats life over and all I feel is horrible regret. I've got a lot of impossible unsolvable problems...I miss her.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of regret and sorrow related to the well-being of the author's cat. while the author expresses feelings of guilt and sadness, these emotions are directed towards their perceived failure in providing a good environment for their pet. the mention of ""impossible unsolvable problems"" and missing the cat suggests a sense of loss and frustration. however, these feelings are specific to the situation with the cat rather than indicating a broader sense of social isolation or loneliness. the focus is on the regret and emotional turmoil over the cat's situation, rather than a lack of social connections or support systems typically associated with loneliness."
i beg for attention and then if i get it i ignore it[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a behavior pattern where the individual seeks attention but then disregards it once received. this could indicate a complex relationship with social interaction, but it doesn't necessarily point to loneliness. people experiencing loneliness often crave and value social engagement when they receive it. the act of ignoring attention might suggest issues like ambivalence, anxiety, or even a form of self-sabotage, but it doesn't align with the typical emotional state of someone who feels isolated and deprived of meaningful connections. instead, it might reflect internal conflicts or a defensive mechanism rather than an expression of loneliness."
"Together, You &amp; I.Good morning, Friend. Good night, Friend. If I could look you in the eye, I??d like to tell you that this feeling we both have will go away, but time is slow and we may not be on the same wavelengths of progress. We are not on the same boat. We are on two separate boats and we are passing by. If I get to that point before you where we both want to be, I??ll come back and point you in the right direction. Cause at one point we were both same boat. We will get through this, together, You and I.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of companionship and mutual support. the repeated use of the word ""friend"" indicates a connection with another person. the writer expresses a desire to help and support their friend, suggesting a strong bond. the acknowledgment of being on separate boats but still moving towards a common goal shows an understanding of individual journeys within a shared experience. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation or a longing for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it emphasizes togetherness and a commitment to mutual progress, which are signs of a supportive and connected relationship."
"I had one of those dreamsOne of those where you fall in love with someone. You feel so close to them. Every touch, every hug, every kiss, feels completely real until you wake up and realize that it was a dream and that the person in the dream wasn't real at all. Its absolutely heartbreaking to wake up and realize that someone who cared for you dearly was simply a figment of your imagination",0,"the narrative describes a vivid dream experience where the author falls in love with an imaginary person. while the dream's emotional intensity and the subsequent heartbreak upon waking are palpable, the overall tone does not indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, it reflects a common human experience of longing and the natural disappointment that follows the realization that the dream was not real. the narrative does not delve into feelings of isolation or social disconnection in waking life, which are typical indicators of loneliness. rather, it focuses on the ephemeral nature of dreams and the bittersweet emotions they can evoke, suggesting a momentary rather than chronic emotional state."
"Anyone care to chat?Bored, lonely, and looking for someone to chat with. I am a male and find it wasier to chat with women, but i am open to talk with anyone. PMs open",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction, specifically mentioning feelings of boredom and a preference for chatting with women. however, the open invitation to talk with anyone and the casual tone suggest a search for companionship rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. the individual's willingness to engage with a broad audience and the casual nature of the request indicate a temporary state of seeking social engagement rather than persistent loneliness. the use of ""pms open"" also implies a proactive approach to finding conversation partners, further supporting the idea that the person is not experiencing profound loneliness but rather a momentary need for interaction."
"Why was i cursed to never find love and be single and alone all the time since i am a good looking guy that keeps getting rejected by very unfriendly and very rude women that just have no manners and personality at all when i try to start a conversation with the one that i would like to really meet?I feel like as a single man like me that was really hoping to find love, instead i always meet very unfriendly rude women most of the time unfortunately.  And i am good looking, that isn't overweight at all either which i exercise a lot too.  And yet, i have trouble meeting a good woman that will be able to accept me for who i really am.  Why are women so very difficult to meet these days since i know other single friends that are having the same problem as well?",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and confusion about repeated rejection and difficulty in finding a romantic partner. the individual mentions feeling cursed and questions why they cannot find love despite considering themselves good looking and physically fit. they also express dissatisfaction with the behavior of the women they encounter, describing them as unfriendly and rude. however, there are no explicit mentions of deeper feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections beyond the romantic context. the narrative focuses more on the perceived shortcomings of others and the external circumstances rather than an internal sense of loneliness or emotional distress. this emphasis on external factors and the absence of broader themes of social isolation suggest that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness in a broader sense but rather specific frustration with their romantic pursuits."
"26 M UKLooking for some interesting conversations as the days seem to drag now.

DM if you want to chat! :)",0,"the narrative suggests an individual seeking social interaction, but it does not exhibit strong indicators of loneliness. the person mentions that days seem to drag, which could imply boredom rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the tone remains upbeat and open, as evidenced by the invitation for others to dm if they want to chat. this willingness to engage and the positive expression of seeking interesting conversations suggest a proactive approach to socializing rather than a desperate need for connection. the absence of emotional distress or feelings of emptiness further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
If you need help please pm meIf you've got any problems or need advice please pm I'll try my best to help I'm going to be here for a few hours so if you need me use me,0,"the narrative reflects a person who is actively offering support and assistance to others, which suggests a sense of connection and engagement with the community. the repeated invitations to reach out for help and the willingness to be available for a few hours indicate that the individual is focused on providing aid rather than seeking it. this proactive stance in helping others is generally associated with a sense of purpose and social interaction, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it suggests that the person feels integrated and valued within their social environment."
"Do good things really happen when you least expect it?My question is for the people who came out of their depression, adhd and social anxiety.

I am coming to this sub to rant about things because things never work out for me. I always overthink about my life and how miserable I am

Even though I don??t believe that someone or something you love will find you without working towards it, do good things happen when you least expect it?

If you say yes, I??ll start overthinking about it.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is seeking advice and expressing frustration about their personal struggles, but it does not indicate loneliness. the person mentions dealing with depression, adhd, and social anxiety, which are serious mental health concerns, yet they are reaching out to a community for support and advice. this action suggests a connection with others, even if it's through an online platform. the individual's overthinking and questioning about whether good things happen unexpectedly show a desire for hope and reassurance rather than a sense of isolation. their willingness to engage with others about their concerns and to seek answers from those who have overcome similar challenges implies they are not entirely alone in their experiences."
"Made a discord for anyone to joinHey, lot of stuff going on in the world and a lot of hate and i personally lost someone in my life i loved a lot and ive got a lot of stress

I know a lot of people out there are going throguh the same thing.

I made a discord server a few months back called ""The Boys Aint Home"" because a lot of my friends have sort of stopped talking to me and i wanted to make a server for people who also are going through the same thing, just a place to relax and chill and meet new people.

I dont want hate or anything on here so if anyone is going to try and raid it, you will be blocked and ill temporaily close the invite link, I just wanted to make a nice safe place for people to vent or play video games with other people who just need to unwind.

Stay safe everyone :)

the server link: [https://discord.gg/2KfAGCV](https://discord.gg/2KfAGCV)",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has taken proactive steps to create a supportive community for others. while they mention experiencing personal loss and stress, their actions indicate resilience and a desire to connect positively with others. they have established a discord server to offer a safe space for people to relax, vent, and meet new friends, which demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing their situation. this initiative reflects a sense of agency and social engagement rather than isolation. the emphasis on creating a welcoming and hate-free environment further underscores their intention to foster connection and support. overall, the narrative suggests that the individual is coping by reaching out and building a community, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
TalkYo someone just want to talk I'm 20,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction, which is a normal and healthy aspect of human behavior. the request to ""talkyo someone"" and the expression of wanting to ""just want to talk"" can be interpreted as a simple need for conversation rather than a deeper sense of loneliness. the brief mention of age, ""i am 20,"" might suggest a young adult seeking to connect with peers, which is typical for this stage of life as individuals often seek to expand their social circles and establish new relationships. the lack of emotional depth or mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or disconnection from others points towards a non-lonely state. instead, the narrative reflects a common and straightforward social need rather than an indication of loneliness."
Somebody tell me everything is going to be okPlease. I just don??t know anymore. I am so lost.,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of confusion and a plea for reassurance, which might initially suggest emotional distress. however, the lack of specific indicators of chronic loneliness, such as references to long-term isolation, a persistent lack of social connections, or feelings of being unloved or unvalued, suggests otherwise. the request for reassurance could stem from a temporary situation or a momentary feeling of being overwhelmed rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness. it’s important to differentiate between transient emotional states and chronic loneliness, which typically involves a prolonged and pervasive sense of social disconnection."
I feel alone. Can I get a female friend here?[deleted],0,"the narrative expresses a desire for companionship, specifically seeking a female friend. however, the brevity and straightforwardness of the statement suggest it might be more about seeking social interaction rather than a deep sense of loneliness. the phrase ""can i get a female friend here?"" implies a casual request, which could be interpreted as someone simply looking to expand their social circle rather than expressing an emotional struggle. the lack of detailed emotional context or descriptions of feelings of isolation might indicate that the individual is not experiencing profound loneliness but rather a situational need for social connection."
"I hate high schoolDo I get bullied? No. Do I have bad grades? No. But I don't have have any real friends. I see people around me in group chats, or laughing happily with their real friends. I'm just an outsider. I don't have a real social circle. And the worst part is, I did this to myself. I can never decide if I want to be social or not. It sucks. For a while I want to be quiet and reserved, and then I want to have friends. But I can't because I'm not social all the time like regular people. It just doesn't work like that. I have to pick one or the other. But all I get now is just constant reminders that I'm a loser. I want it to end.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of dissatisfaction with the high school experience, primarily due to a lack of meaningful friendships. the individual describes feeling like an outsider, observing others enjoying social interactions while they themselves remain isolated. they mention a self-imposed social dilemma, where indecision about whether to be social or reserved leads to a lack of consistent social engagement. the narrative also highlights self-criticism and feelings of being a ""loser,"" indicating significant self-esteem issues. however, despite these feelings, there is no direct expression of profound loneliness. the focus is more on the frustration with the situation and self-blame rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual's awareness of their role in their social isolation and the fluctuating desire for social interaction suggests a struggle with identity and social anxiety rather than loneliness itself."
"""Shooting your shot"" is useless if you have no ammoIdk, this may sound juvenile at best but there's this girl in my class and I just think she's really pretty. Issue is that I figured I'd just leave it at that but my friends tried to push me to talk to her and I keep feeling as if everything I say is futile, as if it's ridiculous to assume she'd even want to be friends with me at any point because I'm not worth talking to at all.

Honestly don't know what the point of this was, maybe I just needed to vent, but just I can't bring myself to keep trying to befriend her because in the end I know I'll mess it up somehow.

(If this is the wrong subreddit for this I'm sorry)",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-doubt and insecurity rather than loneliness. the individual expresses an admiration for a classmate but feels hesitant to approach her due to a lack of confidence. the language used, such as ""feeling as if everything i say is futile"" and ""i am not worth talking to at all,"" suggests a struggle with self-esteem. however, the presence of friends who encourage interaction indicates a social support network, which is a protective factor against loneliness. the individual's uncertainty and desire to vent are more indicative of common social anxiety rather than a deeper sense of isolation or loneliness. the overall tone and context point to typical adolescent insecurities about social interactions and self-worth rather than a profound feeling of being alone or disconnected."
"Disappointed in loveEverytime I think someone might be into me, they either disappear or just  go ahead and get a girlfriend. Every Time. Whyyyyy? I just want to have someone to talk to at nights.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of disappointment and frustration in romantic pursuits, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual's expression of wanting someone to talk to at nights suggests a desire for companionship, which is a common human experience and not exclusively tied to loneliness. the repeated pattern of potential partners disappearing or getting girlfriends might point to bad luck or timing rather than an inherent sense of isolation. the use of ""whyyyy?"" highlights exasperation rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of being alone. overall, the narrative focuses more on romantic setbacks rather than a broader feeling of loneliness in other aspects of life."
"RepeatAnother night alone. Off work late. Work buddy/interest says ??call if you want?? Our way of saying one of us  want to talk but only if you feel like  talking too. I decide not to and text him my mood is shit and I??d talk to him tomorrow. Receive a text I expected. A judgy solution filled overstepping statement about my mindset when he doesn??t know me enough to say such things. It??s so annoying. Is it me. Feel like I??m the one constantly pushing these people away sometimes but I also don??t feel like  I??m hard  to deal with. I??m not passive but I??m super easy to please and easy to help. I don??t take life too seriously anymore because I??m fucking insane so it takes a lot to bother me.

I??m currently high and drunk, about to get drunker and self loathe for an hour or so until i pass out. And I??m gonna do it again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day. Life without friends anymore is fun.",0,"the narrative depicts a scenario where the individual is experiencing frustration and annoyance with their social interactions, particularly with a work buddy. they describe a pattern of behavior where they avoid communication, feel judged, and respond by engaging in self-destructive activities like drinking and getting high. while the individual mentions feelings of annoyance and self-loathing, they also indicate a certain level of acceptance and detachment from these emotions, suggesting they do not take life too seriously. the narrative does not emphasize feelings of isolation or a deep yearning for meaningful connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it portrays a sense of resignation and a coping mechanism that involves substance use rather than a profound sense of being alone. the repetitive nature of their actions and the casual mention of life without friends being ""fun"" further supports the notion that their primary issue is not loneliness but rather a coping strategy for dealing with their circumstances."
"Midnight RantHey. Glad you joined me tonight and listen to what I have to say. Not that this might be of an importance to anyone but anyways...  
It is 4 am and I'm sitting on my Laptop in bed and wide awake. I feel like shit. Honestly terrible. On one hand because i twisted my ankle pretty bad just recently because I'm stupid. On the other hand is because I just installed TikTok earlier that day. And you might ask yourself whats so wrong about installing TikTok nowdays since nearly everyone uses it even though it can be a bit cringey sometimes. And you're absolutely right. There is nothing wrong with that itself. It's just... my for you page became a depression filled mess. It changed from the usual happy go lucky content you'd might expect from a platform like TikTok to a depressed and sad pile of bs. And in the middle there's me. I've been in bed and watching those sad and depressive ""motivational"" type of tik toks for the last couple of hours and feeling miserable. Part of me just wanted to die internally. The entire time I just wanted to cry. But i couldn't. No matter how hard I tried I just could not do it. Until I stumbled upon one video that hit me really hard and it felt so relatable because I was going through that exact situation they were describing in that video. And so I just started crying all of a sudden. And I really don't cry very often. It was the first time in 2 years I was able to cry like that. I kinda felt relieved afterwards.

Now its nearly 4:30 am and the weather outside is just going nuts. I am still sad. Why am I like this...

&amp;#x200B;

Why can't I just be happy... Why can't I just be normal...",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of acute emotional distress rather than chronic loneliness. the individual describes feeling miserable and having a bad night, exacerbated by consuming depressing content on tiktok. however, there are no clear indications of long-term isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others. the person is engaging with social media, which suggests a desire for connection, even if the content they encountered was negative. they also express a sense of relief after crying, indicating that they are processing their emotions. the focus is more on a temporary state of sadness and frustration rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
Gonna kill myselfNo one can stop me,0,"the narrative expresses a severe emotional crisis and a potential risk for self-harm, but it doesn't specifically indicate loneliness. while feelings of isolation can sometimes accompany suicidal ideation, the narrative lacks explicit references to loneliness, such as feelings of being disconnected from others, yearning for companionship, or experiencing social withdrawal. instead, it focuses solely on the intent to end one's life, which can stem from a variety of psychological issues, including depression, despair, or overwhelming stress. thus, the absence of clear indicators of loneliness, like expressions of missing social interactions or feeling unseen and unheard by others, suggests that loneliness is not the primary issue highlighted in this narrative."
"How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you? (LONG POST)How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you?

I am trying so hard to redefine success - which at the core I truly believe is fulfillment/satisfaction/contentment/happiness/inner peace.

But it's hard when you come from a culture (I was born and raised in the United States but my family is of Asian descent) that highly praises and emphasizes honor, awards/accolades, academic success, big-named schools, prestige, power, popularity/fame, riches, status, meeting the stereotypical life milestones by a specific age, etc. I'm trying to break away from this mindset. I am very close with my family, but, I hate that we are part of a community that really is deeply enmeshed in this ideal if you know what I mean. Social events with other Asian folks (people my parents know and their kids who are in their late 20s/30s). I'm in my late 20s (for context), single, unemployed, and living with my parents. Graduated medical school in 2019 but have had to study for licensing exams in order to get a job in my field. These exams have given me a very difficult time. I've never been a good studier/test taker. Always been a mediocre student. I graduated at the bottom 10% of my class. I couldn't get involved in extracurriculars because I failed exams and was very overwhelmed with my rigorous program. Even repeated a year and graduated later than my friends (who are all working). Barely passed my first board and am studying to re-take another exam that I need for medical residency. It's been a difficult journey. This certainly is not how I envisioned my life post graduation. It's taking me so long to get my life together. I feel bad because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) throughout my entire journey and it's taking me so long to get my life together. I have heard them a couple times comparing me to other girls my age: ""Look! so and so is your age and almost done with medical residency and she's ready to start her fellowship. She's pregnant with her second child."" or, ""When are you going to hurry up? So and so already has interviews for residency programs.""

I want to be a child psychiatrist more than anything though. I'm just frustrated it's taking longer than I hoped. And besides being a practicing doctor, there is SO MUCH else I want to do in life (publish a book, get into flower design, start a podcast, candle-making, travel, etc.)

But I feel self-conscious and even inadequate about my station in life sometimes. While I do appreciate the time and freedom I have (because of the lack of responsibilities), at social gatherings, people ALWAYS ask what I'm up to. I feel inadequate compared to the other girls my age who are established doctors in training/lawyers/aspiring business magnates/politicians/diplomats/etc. who have gone to or are working for prestigious institutions/programs. Some even married and also with kids. While I have none of that at the moment. A few of the girls are honestly really mean to. They pry and ask about what I'm doing, when I'm applying to residency, what I've been doing since graduation, etc. and they lord it over me what they have - being far along in their medical training, being married, etc. In my interactions, I try not to let my upset feelings show on my face. I try and demonstrate grace congratulating them on their achievements, asking them what they like about work/their spouse/kids, etc. But I still feel bothered on the inside. I want to get to a point where I don't feel provoked by other people no matter what they do/say. I genuinely want to wish them well in their lives (even if they are jerks). Getting to that point is hard because sometimes I feel that it's not fair what they have (or that because they are shitty people that they have success in life). Really trying to get out of this frame of thinking because I'm not seeing the full picture. I know they're just projecting what they want me and other people to see. But I know genuinely wishing them well and being happy to see that they got what they wanted hits folks like this on another level. How do I stop feeling bothered?

I am very attached to my parents. This time I've had with them since I moved back home after finishing school has been precious. The other night I thought to myself: ""When am I ever going to have this amount of dedicated time with them ever again? I don't know if I ever will...life moves so fast...""

The only thing that's been helping me has been church and Bible time. I have started going recently and I feel...great every single time I go. I am reminded of the brevity of our lives. Whether a human being lives until 100 or 80 years...that is still short in light of eternity. And while I am aware of this sobering reality (and time with God has changed my perspective on what's truly important). This thought always crosses my mind when I hear news of a rich and famous person dying. They've accumulated everything and couldn't take anything with them.

It's just hard remembering this in the moment when I'm at these social functions. People are mean. They attach their worth to what you have/haven't accomplished. They attach your worth to your career/other external measures of success. I have started to realize that it's an individual's heart and character that carries them far, isn't it? It's really sad how the world doesn't see it that way.

I know we're in the middle of a pandemic (and the States has no intention of going under lockdown). I'm just afraid of going to social events. They make me anxious. I don't want to make an appearance because of where I am in life. I know it sounds terrible.

How can I get better about this?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with feelings of inadequacy and frustration due to societal and familial expectations. despite the evident struggle with self-worth and comparison to peers, the person demonstrates a strong support system, including close family ties and newfound solace in church and bible study. they articulate a desire to redefine success and recognize the superficiality of external achievements. their efforts to maintain grace in social interactions, despite internal turmoil, and their focus on personal growth and meaningful relationships, suggest resilience and a proactive approach to overcoming challenges. while they acknowledge the difficulty of their journey, their introspective nature and reliance on supportive networks indicate a foundation that mitigates the depth of loneliness. the narrative lacks explicit expressions of profound isolation or disconnection, instead highlighting an ongoing effort to align personal values with societal pressures and the pursuit of inner peace."
PS4 chat?I??m not particularly lonely myself right now but I thought it might be cool to talk about life.  34/M/USA,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is open to social interaction but does not exhibit signs of loneliness. the author explicitly states that they are not feeling lonely at the moment, indicating a sense of contentment with their current social situation. the casual invitation to chat about life suggests a desire for social engagement rather than a need to alleviate loneliness. the mention of their age, gender, and location adds to the impression of someone who is comfortable sharing personal information and seeking out connections in a relaxed manner. overall, the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of isolation, sadness, or a desperate need for companionship. instead, it portrays a person who is sociable and interested in forming new connections without any underlying sense of loneliness."
Fun hobbies?Does anyone have some fun hobbies I could try out? I??ve felt so alone and down lately and I want to try something new. What are some hobbies or things you recommend to make me feel something again. Keep in mind I??m only 18 years old and I have a limited budget to work with.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual's curiosity and eagerness to explore new activities, which is a positive sign of proactive behavior and interest in self-improvement. the person is reaching out for suggestions on hobbies, indicating they are seeking engagement and stimulation rather than withdrawing or isolating themselves. the mention of feeling ""alone and down lately"" could be interpreted as a temporary state rather than a chronic condition, especially since the individual is actively looking for solutions. their openness to trying new things and the context of being 18 years old, a time often characterized by exploration and self-discovery, suggests a normal developmental phase rather than a deeper sense of loneliness. the request for budget-friendly hobbies also shows practical thinking and a willingness to adapt to their circumstances, further supporting the notion that they are managing their situation constructively."
"Ever just want a fake gf or bf?Like just someone to say sweet nothings to and give unconditional love, but not want to know what they look like or where they come from. Like I follow r/rolereversal and would love to be doted on like that, or do that to someone else. I'm this desperate for affection lol",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for affection and companionship, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a whimsical wish for a ""fake"" romantic partner, suggesting a playful or imaginative approach to their need for emotional connection. they mention following a specific subreddit and express interest in role reversal, which implies they are engaged in social communities and have a sense of humor about their situation. the use of ""lol"" at the end indicates a lighthearted tone rather than deep emotional distress. these elements suggest that while the person desires affection, they are not experiencing the profound sense of isolation typically associated with loneliness."
"people really don??t know how small things can effect people.the smallest thing can make a big impact. just receiving a text can make me hype, a hug can do so much. there??s this one guy who whenever i walk by we always say ??HOWDY?? and that shit makes my day. 


that being said, the smallest thing can really fuck me up. someone i liked made a comment about bi people that wasn??t great. kinda shook me. and people sigh when they??re paired with me on ?? anything. 


i also may just be sensitive, but remember your actions can effect people in ways you don??t notice.",0,"the narrative expresses an awareness of the impact of small gestures and interactions, both positive and negative. the author mentions that simple acts like receiving a text or a friendly greeting can significantly uplift their mood, indicating that they find joy and connection in everyday social exchanges. they also reflect on a negative comment and others' reactions to being paired with them, acknowledging that these experiences can be hurtful. however, the overall tone suggests that the author is more sensitive to social interactions rather than deeply lonely. their ability to find happiness in small, positive moments and their self-awareness about sensitivity point towards a nuanced understanding of social dynamics rather than an overarching sense of isolation."
"More than 3 years ago I lost contact with a friend from Australia, I'm from Ukraine, cannot find him anywhere. Feeling hopeless and lonely. I still miss you, Jackson, I wish I could talk with you againWe met each other on a web-site called [interpals.com](https://interpals.com) more than 3 years ago. He's from Australia, I'm from Ukraine, but despite a huge time difference we enjoyed our conversation. He was so kind and gentle to me, supported me when I needed it. With him I felt much better, we hoped to meet each other one day. But he disappeared, deleted his profile, and in his last message he said that it wasn't my fault. I still wanna know what happened in fact, I still worry about him. All my searches failed, so I feel really hopeless. I don't understand what to do with this situation, I can't let it go. Should I stop looking for him or continue and believe that I'll find him?",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of loss and longing for a friend who has disappeared. the author expresses feelings of hopelessness and confusion about what to do next. while these emotions are intense, they are specifically tied to the loss of this particular friendship rather than a broader sense of loneliness. the author reminisces about the positive aspects of their relationship, highlighting how the friend provided support and kindness. this focus on a specific individual and the unique connection they shared suggests that the author's distress is situational rather than indicative of a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative does not mention other aspects of the author's social life or feelings of isolation beyond this particular loss, which further supports the idea that their emotional struggle is centered on this specific relationship rather than a general state of loneliness."
"I??m content right now, but I just feel like babbling away my successes and I don??t have anyone to tell right now..[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a sense of contentment and a desire to share successes, which are positive emotions. the individual expresses a wish to communicate but does not indicate any deeper feelings of isolation or sadness. the phrase ""i don't have anyone to tell right now"" might suggest a temporary situation rather than a chronic state of loneliness. it seems more like a momentary lack of an available audience rather than a pervasive feeling of being alone. overall, the context and the examples provided indicate that the person is not experiencing loneliness, as their primary emotions are contentment and a simple wish to share their achievements."
"Approaching the closing chapters of my life/freedomWell I'm finally here, I hate school so much that I'd rather be in a mental hospital until I drop out deadass, so much pressure and stress, lack of relationships and friendships up to this point, it's very bad for your mental and I'm losing it, I feel like I'm gonna lose it completely if things don't get better, I have two months left to complete the things I want to get done before I leave for a very long time, and even through I won't be able to live a normal life anymore I know that maybe I really am a terrible person and I was never meant to have anything, except betrayal and disgust and unfairness, I don't care about the slight possibility that things can get better at school because they haven't been getting better, and even through I'm gonna be under worse but better situations in there, than out here, I feel at ease, like I was supposed to go through all this hell alone, like I was singled out and there's nothing to be done about it.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of despair and frustration, primarily centered around the intense pressure and stress associated with school. the author mentions a lack of relationships and friendships, which are critical factors contributing to their deteriorating mental health. despite this, the narrative reflects a resignation to their circumstances rather than an active yearning for connection. phrases like ""i feel at ease"" and ""like i was supposed to go through all this hell alone"" suggest a certain acceptance of their solitude rather than a profound sense of loneliness. the individual's focus is more on their internal struggles and the overwhelming burden of their environment rather than a desperate need for social interaction or companionship. this distinction indicates that while the author is undoubtedly experiencing significant emotional distress, it is not primarily driven by loneliness."
Loneliness in past and now.[removed],0,"the narrative indicates that the individual is reflecting on their past experiences with loneliness but does not seem to be currently experiencing it. the mention of loneliness in the past suggests that they have had moments of feeling isolated or disconnected, which are common indicators of loneliness. however, the phrase ""and now"" implies a contrast, suggesting that their present situation is different. this shift could be due to improved social connections, personal growth, or other positive changes in their life. the absence of current expressions of isolation, sadness, or a lack of companionship in the narrative supports the conclusion that the individual is not presently lonely. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include ongoing feelings of emptiness, a lack of meaningful relationships, or an expressed desire for more social interaction, none of which are evident here. this context suggests that the individual has moved past their previous loneliness and is now in a better emotional and social state."
I just want friends from eu thats 17+ that i can talk and play with[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a straightforward desire for companionship and connection with friends from the eu who are 17 or older, with a focus on shared activities like talking and playing. this desire for social interaction and friendship is a common and healthy social need, rather than an indication of loneliness. the absence of deeper emotional distress or feelings of isolation suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness. instead, they are actively seeking to expand their social circle and engage in enjoyable activities with others, which is typical of someone who values social connections and is looking to enhance their social life in a positive manner."
Worst day of the yearNo girlfriend and no friends. This really sucks :??(,0,"the narrative expresses a momentary feeling of frustration and disappointment, likely due to a specific event or a bad day. while the individual mentions not having a girlfriend or friends, which can be associated with loneliness, the tone and context suggest a transient emotional response rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the use of informal language and emoticons indicates a casual venting rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation. it's possible that the individual has social connections but is experiencing a temporary low point, which is not uncommon and does not necessarily reflect a prolonged experience of loneliness."
I wanna dieI figured a couple years ago that my only purpose in life is to make other ms happy after I received a text from my cousin right as I saw the train I was going to jump in front of. I haven??t been happy in a while. No one really loves me. I just get tossed aside after people realize that they don??t want or need me. I really do want someone to just hold me. Or I at least wanna hear a comforting voice.,0,"the narrative presents a deeply distressing and emotional account of the individual's state of mind. expressions such as ""i wanna die"" and ""i haven't been happy in a while"" indicate a profound sense of despair and sadness. the writer also describes feelings of being unloved and unwanted, noting that they feel discarded by others. the desire for physical comfort or a comforting voice suggests a longing for connection and support. while these elements might typically be associated with loneliness, it is crucial to recognize that such feelings can also stem from other mental health issues such as depression or a crisis of self-worth. the narrative reveals significant emotional pain and a critical need for intervention and support, regardless of the specific label."
Can somebody just understand me?[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a desire for understanding, which can be a common human experience rather than a specific indicator of loneliness. the request for understanding does not necessarily imply a lack of social connections or emotional isolation. it could stem from a moment of frustration or a need for empathy, which are typical feelings that many individuals experience from time to time. without additional context, it's challenging to ascertain deeper feelings of loneliness. the brevity of the statement and lack of further emotional detail do not strongly suggest chronic loneliness or persistent social disconnection. instead, it appears more as an isolated expression of a need for validation or comprehension."
"16yo me was a fuckbitchthis isnt the right place, but it??s just kinda become my rant sub, idk. I was going through old messages in my reddit inbox (you know, the ones you cant delete) on my main. I WAS SO CRINGE 5 YEARS AGO. I said some REAL epic cringe bullshit that no one should EVER SAY. I can??t even believe I EVER felt like it was appropriate or funny to say the things I fucking said.

I know there??s nothing a can do to change my past self... but no wonder i assumed everyone hated me. They probably did! I was a piece of shit and deserved it! It makes sense that im alone now. I??ve been a cringey piece of human garbage most of my life.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of self-criticism and regret about past behavior, which is common during adolescence and personal growth. the individual expresses embarrassment over their past actions and acknowledges the impact it may have had on their social interactions. while they mention feeling alone and unloved, the tone suggests more of a critical self-reflection rather than an ongoing sense of loneliness. the use of strong language and the admission of perceived social rejection indicate a moment of intense self-awareness and regret, but it doesn't necessarily imply a persistent state of loneliness. the narrative appears to be more about grappling with past mistakes and the resulting feelings rather than an enduring experience of isolation."
"I'm always going to want to die.I'll always be reminded if how much of a burden I am, even though you were homeless and not working when we met. 
I refused to let the fact you let two kids ""go"" meant you were bad in anyways. Shit happens I deny how mad you get because. Come on, I've had worse. Its really just bad fights every now and then. Not daily abuse. 
I just. Always feel ugly dude. I don't have any friends. I don't have any family to call on because half judge everything and I can't go to my dad because he's a drug addict and isn't reliable. 
I know now, my sons dad could figure it out for our kid. Hes out there in the world doing better and my son would rather be there with his cousins right? 
You literally want me to leave for your bday. You are happy for it. 
I hate that I keep coming back.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of despair and self-deprecation, highlighting themes of feeling like a burden and experiencing significant relational conflicts. the individual mentions having no friends or reliable family support, which are common indicators of loneliness. however, despite these indicators, there are elements that suggest the presence of significant others in their life, such as their partner and son. the narrative also touches on past experiences and current struggles, suggesting an ongoing battle with self-worth and external judgments. the complexity of their relationships and the presence of others in their life may contribute to a sense of connection, albeit strained, which could explain the classification. the narrative portrays a challenging emotional landscape, but the existence of these connections indicates a nuanced situation beyond mere loneliness."
Fucken Kombucha got me up...[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a casual and somewhat humorous tone, which is often not associated with feelings of loneliness. the use of informal language and a light-hearted complaint about kombucha suggests the author is engaging in a normal, everyday activity and is likely sharing an anecdote for entertainment or venting. this kind of expression is typical of someone who feels comfortable enough to share mundane experiences, indicating social connectivity rather than isolation. the absence of deeper emotional content or themes of solitude further supports the notion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"Can??t hangout 1 on 1 with most people?Does this happen to anyone else?  I was somewhat ??popular?? in early high school years and easily made friends.. As the years went on (and i experienced some trauma) i became very socially awkward.  

I lost contact with most friends and found it hard to keep old friends or make new friends.. The weird thing is, if i??m in a group of 3 or even more i??m fine?  But when i try to be 1 on 1 with anyone, even people i??ve known a long time, i get so uncomfortable and constantly thinking what to say next instead of being in the moment.. 

I don??t understand this because most of these subreddits people say they feel better NOT in groups.  It??s so frustrating because creating real bonds means being along with people, texting 1 on 1, calling and facetiming.. these things make me feel so awkward.

When i??m in most groups i can be funny, bubbly and even loud.  Is this something anyone else experiences?

It??s so hard to make connections with people because of this and it makes me feel very alone.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with social interactions, particularly in one-on-one settings, which can stem from past trauma and resulting social awkwardness. while the individual describes difficulty in maintaining and forming close friendships, they also mention being comfortable and even thriving in group settings. this ability to engage in groups suggests that they are not entirely isolated or devoid of social connections. the frustration and self-awareness about their discomfort in one-on-one interactions indicate a desire for deeper connections, but the presence of some social support through group interactions mitigates the sense of complete loneliness. the narrative highlights a specific social challenge rather than an overarching feeling of loneliness, as the individual still finds ways to connect with others, albeit in a different context."
About me...nan,0,"the narrative is extremely brief and lacks any emotional or personal content, which suggests a neutral state rather than one characterized by loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might express feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or detailed accounts of their emotional state. the absence of such elements in this narrative indicates that the author is not currently experiencing loneliness. instead, the succinct and detached nature of the narrative could imply a sense of normalcy or disinterest, neither of which are common indicators of loneliness."
"Discord for the Lonely ??????I??ve made a discord a couple days ago for people who don??t really likes friends, like myself, and I hope we make a happy family. This is the link:


https://discord.gg/vwdfHRG

So happy you can join us!",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is proactively creating a community for those who may not have many friends, but the tone and intent suggest a sense of optimism and connection rather than loneliness. the person is taking steps to foster a supportive environment, indicating a desire for social interaction and a positive outlook on forming new relationships. the mention of making a ""happy family"" and the welcoming invitation to join the discord group highlight an effort to build a network and engage with others. these actions and expressions are typically associated with someone who is seeking companionship and community, rather than feeling isolated or lonely."
A Single Spark could start a Forest FireI hate that I??m so lonely and deprived of affection that when a girl is nice to me I automatically start fall in love and push myself upon them before I lose them or someone else gets to them first and end pushing them farther away until they??re gone.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and emotional turmoil stemming from a perceived lack of affection and connection. the individual describes a pattern of behavior where they quickly develop intense feelings for anyone who shows them kindness, leading to actions that ultimately push people away. this cycle of desperation and subsequent rejection suggests an underlying struggle with self-esteem and fear of abandonment, which are often associated with loneliness. however, the narrative's focus on self-awareness and the recognition of this harmful pattern may indicate a level of insight and resilience that helps the individual cope with these feelings, potentially mitigating the full impact of loneliness."
I??m lonely as fuck as you are. Can we chat on FaceTime/WhatsApp?Honestly I??ll accept anyone to talk with. I know you are socially anxious like me but let??s share our pain together . Please dm me.,0,"the narrative demonstrates a strong desire for social interaction and connection, suggesting a proactive approach to addressing feelings of isolation. the individual explicitly reaches out for communication through facetime or whatsapp, indicating an openness and willingness to engage with others. the mention of accepting anyone to talk with and the acknowledgment of shared social anxiety reflect an empathetic understanding of mutual struggles. this outreach behavior and the readiness to connect can be seen as attempts to mitigate loneliness rather than signs of deep-seated loneliness. the plea for direct messaging further supports the notion that the individual is actively seeking companionship and emotional support, which are positive steps towards fostering social bonds."
"I killed my friendship with my friend.So i was having some problems with my friend because she was being a little bit disrespectful over the months like making fun of my mental problem or my looks a lot or how no girl likes me. Today she had a fight with her group of friends and she texted me ??What people with no friends do you would know?? and i flipped and i said i won??t take anymore disrespect and it was over. 
I have been feeling guilty about it for a while now because all of the statements had some truth in them that??s why i found them so offensive. Yes they were calling my insecurities out but they were the truth. I just feel anxious.",0,"the narrative describes a conflict with a friend who has been disrespectful over time, particularly by mocking personal insecurities and mental health issues. the writer reaches a breaking point after a particularly hurtful comment and decides to end the friendship. although they feel guilty and anxious about the decision, the emotions described are more indicative of a response to specific interpersonal conflict rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the presence of guilt and anxiety stems from the recognition of hurtful truths rather than an underlying feeling of being isolated or disconnected from others. the narrative focuses on the dynamics of the friendship and the impact of disrespectful behavior rather than expressing a broader sense of social isolation or longing for connection, which are more typical indicators of loneliness."
"We deserve better than thisHi, first time poster but an occasional lurker. I just wanted to say that we're a lot stronger than people give us credit for. Unfortunately there's this burden put on lonely people, a piece of ""advice"" people always put out there that always runs along the lines of outcasts and misfits being their own burden. 

If only we could all just change in the right way to be accepted, right? I call bullshit... Sure we all have aspects that make us less palpable, but who doesn't? Some of the most popular are also the most rude, selfish, insufferable people on earth (obviously not all, but the existence of people like this shows there's more than just ""bad behavior"" at play). Truth is, most of us are just different.

I'm personally done changing for other people. If I change I want it to be for ME, because I'm done being someone I'm NOT. And if you're reading this and you feel like your feet are at the edge of the world with not a soul around to care, just know you're worth fighting for. You're just like anyone else, with feelings, and hopes and dreams. If others deserve to be cared for, then we do too.

I know this is probably just a rambling, frustrated post, but if you're out there feeling alone and uncared about, remember YOU DO MATTER. 

And thank you, to all the strangers on here, for creating a community where a person like me can find solidarity among others who have walked this lonely path. Thank you.",0,"the narrative showcases a sense of empowerment and resilience rather than loneliness. the author speaks about the strength and solidarity found within a community of individuals who might feel like outcasts. they reject the notion that they need to change to be accepted and emphasize the importance of self-acceptance and personal growth. the tone is more about frustration with societal expectations and a call to recognize one's own worth, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or despair. the author also acknowledges the supportive nature of the community they are part of, which indicates they do not feel alone or uncared for. overall, the narrative highlights themes of self-worth, community support, and resistance to societal pressures, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Names Noah 18, I just feel lost i had two women hit on me today and at first it was cool but then I the pit just got biggerI downloaded hinge and haven't gotten any responses yet, im writing a book it seems to help, I just feel so empty I don't know.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of being lost and empty, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. noah mentions positive social interactions, such as being hit on by two women, which suggests he is not isolated. the fact that he is writing a book and finds it helpful indicates he has an outlet for his emotions and a way to engage in a meaningful activity. the lack of responses on hinge might be contributing to his sense of emptiness, but it doesn't imply a deeper, chronic loneliness. instead, it points to temporary frustration and confusion. these elements suggest that while noah is experiencing emotional struggles, they are not necessarily rooted in loneliness."
My friend killed herself last week. I just got to know. I have no one to vent to about this.Im in so much pain right now. She was a lovely person who deserved only the best.,0,"the narrative describes a profound experience of grief and loss following the suicide of a friend. the writer expresses a deep sense of pain and sorrow, highlighting the emotional turmoil they are currently facing. while the narrative does indicate a lack of immediate social support for venting these feelings, this situation is more indicative of acute grief rather than chronic loneliness. the focus is on the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event, which naturally isolates individuals as they process their emotions. the writer's pain is tied to the specific loss and the cherished memories of their friend, rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others in general."
"Im sorry i just want to share something, would you mind listening?First im sorry if my post make you feel uncomfort, i just want to share what im feeling deep inside..

It's about someone very special to me, a person everytime i feeling scared or bad i always thinking about him and calling his name, i always imagining him here with me. He's like a safe place to me, a happiest place to me, he make me feel okay. He's the reason why i still looking for tomorrow, the reason i didn't lose hope yet, a reason for me to stay. He is my source of motivation, he keep me ""sane"". In my head i always thinking of him as my ""big bro"" (he's 6y older than me) but he can also be a good friend, a teacher and also a best partner to me. He's very special to me. He is everything i want in this world..

But there's a problem, He didn't know me.
He don't even know im exist. I want him to know me but i don't know how to reach him. Im too scared to send a message to him or even leave a comment on his social media, all i can do is ""like"" his post. I wish he could acknowledge me, acknowledge my existence but at the same time i also worried, ""He's not gonna like this, He will judge me, He's not gonna accept me"" for so many reason. There's so many ""wrong"" about me..

I really wish i could talk to him personally, I really want to talk to him. This is so wrong to say this but i need him. I want to be close with him, i want him to be here, i want him to know what i feel. There's a paper i slip on my comic book. On that paper i draw a star symbol with his name written on it. Everytime i feel scared and anxious i wrote a message on that paper. ""Can you hear me?"", ""I need you"" and then i blow the paper like i blow a candles and hope the wind or universe will send my message to him somehow, someway..

I'm so crazy and desperate but i need him. There's so many things I need to fix about me. It's make me feels overwhelming, I need a little help from him. I just need him to be ""here"" for me, that's will be much much bigger help for me, make my life much lighter. The only help i looking for and probably work for me is him. He is my only hope. He is the only thing i need. I like him, i really like him and I want to be with him. I really.. really wish universe make this happen. I make a vow for this..

Thanks for listening to me and im sorry if my post make you uncomfort or creep you out..",0,"the narrative expresses a deep emotional connection to someone who is perceived as a source of comfort and motivation. the individual describes feelings of fear, anxiety, and a sense of being overwhelmed, but these emotions are countered by the imagined presence of this special person. while the longing and idealization of someone who is unaware of the individual's existence might suggest a sense of yearning, the narrative does not exhibit classic signs of loneliness. instead, it reflects a coping mechanism where the individual finds solace and hope through the thought of this person. the focus on positive feelings and the desire for connection, despite the one-sided nature of the relationship, indicates an emotional attachment rather than an experience of loneliness. the individual is not isolated or devoid of social interaction; rather, they are deeply invested in an emotional fantasy that provides them with stability and motivation."
"Civilization 6 is mocking me.*Unlocks Irrigation* 

#??Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.?? - W.H. Auden",0,"the narrative expresses a light-hearted and humorous engagement with a video game, specifically civilization 6. the mention of unlocking irrigation and the playful reference to w.h. auden's quote suggests the author is immersed in the game's mechanics and enjoying the experience. this type of engagement typically indicates an active interest and participation in activities, which is generally not associated with feelings of loneliness. the use of humor and the casual tone further suggest a sense of well-being and a connection to broader cultural references, implying the author is not experiencing loneliness."

sometimes i just wish i had someone that understands",0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of disappointment and unmet expectations regarding companionship. the individual mentions being alone on significant occasions like birthdays and valentine's day, which are often associated with social connections and romantic relationships. the repeated use of phrases like ""i should already have someone by now"" and ""i thought this year i was gonna have a birthday where im not alone"" indicates a deep longing for companionship. the mention of ""paying for someone else's mistake"" suggests feelings of unfairness and perhaps unresolved issues from past relationships. the desire for someone who understands them highlights a craving for emotional support and empathy. these elements are common indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a lack of social and emotional fulfillment."
I feel like cutting[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a significant emotional distress, but the specific language used does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""i feel like cutting"" suggests a severe level of psychological pain or crisis, often associated with self-harm, which can stem from various mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. however, loneliness is characterized more by feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, and a deep sense of being alone even when surrounded by people. the absence of these elements in the narrative suggests that the primary issue here might not be loneliness. instead, the focus seems to be on an immediate emotional or psychological struggle that requires urgent attention, but not necessarily related to the absence of social bonds or feelings of isolation typically seen in loneliness."
23F - MisunderstoodPeople tend to judge me because of my lifestyle (see profile) and act very creepy toward me. It??s really off putting. Please just be kind.,0,"the narrative describes feelings of being judged and experiencing uncomfortable interactions with others, which can be distressing but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual's request for kindness and their mention of being judged for their lifestyle suggest they are aware of and affected by social perceptions. however, there is no indication of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. the person seems to be seeking better social interactions rather than expressing a sense of being alone or disconnected from others. the focus is more on the quality of interactions rather than an absence of them, which aligns with the classification."

I seek someone I can chat with throughout the day. Share funny and maybe not so funny ads memes. Maybe game with. Maybe do a Netflix movie night party. Or even just chat about the next or current series we are watching. I do read but I guess haven't in a while so I'd be down to share books as well.

Sound like you.... well your in luck, I just happen to have a position open and pay is HUGH *said in stupid Trumo voice* ????",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social interaction and has a clear understanding of what they want from potential connections. despite having ended a toxic relationship and working hard, the person remains open to various forms of social engagement, such as gaming, watching movies, and discussing books. the tone is casual and even humorous at times, indicating a positive outlook and a proactive approach to finding companionship. the specific mention of interests and the lighthearted job offer joke suggest a person who is comfortable with themselves and eager to share their life with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these aspects point to someone who is socially engaged and motivated to build new connections."
15/F I'm here to listen if anyone needs to talk to someone :)You can vent to me and I'll be listening. I can't always help you (but I'll try) but talking often helps :) So don't hesitate to text me if you feel like talking someone. Also I feel the most comfortable talking to people around my age.,0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and outwardly focused attitude, with the individual expressing a willingness to support others. this behavior suggests a level of social engagement and emotional availability that is less typical of someone experiencing loneliness. the author’s invitation for others to vent and the emphasis on listening highlights a desire for social interaction and connection, which are positive social behaviors. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation, sadness, or a desire for reciprocation that might indicate loneliness. instead, it demonstrates a sense of purpose and comfort in social interactions, particularly with peers, reinforcing the notion of being socially integrated and emotionally balanced."
I feel like I??m losing my mind with these imaginary dreams I make up instead of facing realitynan,0,"the narrative suggests a struggle with facing reality and a tendency to retreat into imaginary dreams. while this behavior can be associated with various psychological issues, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions feeling like they are losing their mind, which points more towards a sense of confusion or escapism rather than isolation or a lack of social connections. there is no mention of feeling alone, lacking companionship, or desiring social interaction, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. the focus is primarily on the internal conflict and the use of imagination as a coping mechanism, which can be present in individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, or other mental health challenges, but not specifically loneliness."
I just want someone to check in on meJust someone who can compliment me and ask how I??m really doing,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction and validation, which are common human needs. however, the tone and content do not necessarily indicate profound loneliness. the request for someone to check in and provide compliments suggests a normal craving for social connection rather than an indication of isolation or emotional distress. the narrative lacks elements such as feelings of despair, prolonged isolation, or a sense of being disconnected from others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it appears to reflect a momentary need for attention and reassurance, which can occur even in individuals who generally feel well-connected and supported."
"I need somebody to talk to.I am feeling extremely negative inside and it is pushing me towards suicide once again. I think I need someone to vent to. My whole life, I have been alone with no friends, no relationships and my familial relations are already broken. I am beyond hopeless right now. I would appreciate it if I had someone to talk to on discord.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and emotional distress, with the author explicitly stating their need for someone to talk to and their feelings of extreme negativity. the mention of being pushed towards suicidal thoughts and the lack of friends, relationships, and broken familial ties indicate significant emotional turmoil. the request for someone to talk to on discord highlights a desire for connection and support. these elements are typically associated with loneliness, as they reflect a profound sense of disconnection from others and a yearning for social interaction and emotional support. the narrative's emphasis on long-term isolation and hopelessness further underscores the author's struggle with loneliness."
"As I lay here alone, with hopes of a better tomorrow. I lay back and remember my day of success through trials and tribulations. That in which I accomplished my goals and still don??t feel fulfilled. For I do not know that in which I search for, is it love, money, or just the pursuit of happiness.nan",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of contemplation and introspection rather than loneliness. the individual recounts their day and acknowledges their achievements, which suggests a level of self-awareness and personal success. despite feeling unfulfilled, the person is actively questioning and searching for what might bring them satisfaction, indicating a proactive and reflective mindset. the mention of lying alone might initially hint at solitude, but the overall tone is more about seeking meaning and understanding rather than expressing feelings of isolation or loneliness. the pursuit of happiness, love, or money are common existential queries and do not inherently imply loneliness. instead, they suggest a deeper exploration of personal values and goals."
"If you need to talk pm meAlthough all i can offer is to listen, since my advice probably will be absolute garbage",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is open to offering support and willing to listen to others. this willingness to connect and provide a listening ear indicates a sense of social engagement and a desire to be helpful, even if the individual doubts the quality of their advice. the self-deprecating remark about their advice being ""absolute garbage"" could be a sign of humility or a lack of confidence, but it does not necessarily point to loneliness. instead, it highlights a person who is present and available for others, which is typically inconsistent with feelings of isolation or loneliness. the act of inviting others to pm them for conversation suggests they have an active social interaction and a support network, further indicating they are not experiencing loneliness."
Loneliness sucks[removed],0,"the narrative, though expressing a negative sentiment towards loneliness, lacks depth and specificity that typically characterize genuine experiences of loneliness. often, individuals who are truly experiencing loneliness will provide detailed descriptions of their feelings, such as mentioning a sense of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or prolonged periods of solitude. in this case, the statement is brief and general, not delving into personal emotions or circumstances. this lack of elaboration suggests that the author may not be deeply affected by loneliness, but rather making a casual or passing remark. the absence of detailed emotional context and personal anecdotes indicates that the narrative does not reflect the inner turmoil and complexity usually associated with loneliness."
"Tomorrow i should have gotten out of quarantine, today i was informed that i will be in quarantine for another 3 weeksI geniunly want to die, if there was a way to end my life without causing pain to anyone i'd do it 12 times by now",0,"the narrative expresses intense frustration and a sense of despair due to the extended quarantine period, which can be extremely taxing on mental health. however, the primary focus is on the immediate situation and the emotional toll of isolation rather than a broader, ongoing sense of loneliness. the mention of wanting to end life highlights a critical need for mental health support but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. rather, it points to acute distress and hopelessness tied to the specific context of quarantine. the absence of references to a lack of social connections or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that the distress is situational rather than rooted in loneliness."
"Lonely2 years after a long term breakup, I am finally happy with my health, quit the smoking and drinking to excess, I got the body that comes with the health, can swim &amp; run and do anything quicker and faster and don??t feel awful after doing it, got a better job, getting paid more and there is more opportunity, but I just **cannot** shake the loneliness (especially in Lockdown 2.0 in London)

Any advise is much appreciated.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who has made significant positive changes in their life post-breakup. they have improved their health, quit harmful habits, achieved physical fitness, and secured a better job with more opportunities. these accomplishments indicate a level of personal satisfaction and achievement. however, the mention of an inability to shake loneliness, especially during lockdown, highlights a temporary and situational feeling rather than a chronic state. the context of lockdown exacerbates feelings of isolation for many, but the overall tone suggests resilience and an active pursuit of betterment, which are not typical indicators of deep-seated loneliness. the request for advice further demonstrates a proactive approach to managing transient feelings of loneliness."
"What to doI just found a group photo from last night of all of my friends getting together. I wasn??t made privy to it, was free, and I live with two of my friends. I know they??re trying to ditch me because I??ve been a miserable sack since my ex and I broke up two weeks ago. I??m a huge burden on them emotionally and while I??m sad, I can??t say that I disagree. Either way, I??ve toyed with the idea of death for a long time but this is the first time that I??ve actually wanted to kill myself. I don??t care if you read this or if this elicits some super-hero response in you, if my best want enough for a three year relationship and 9 friends, there??s nothing an internet stranger can say that??ll make me feel differently ",0,"the narrative depicts someone experiencing significant emotional distress following a breakup, feeling isolated and perceiving themselves as a burden to their friends. the discovery of the group photo without their inclusion exacerbates their feelings of rejection and worthlessness. they express suicidal thoughts, indicating a severe level of hopelessness. despite these intense feelings, the narrative suggests a lack of desire for external validation or intervention, as they dismiss the potential impact of responses from others. this indicates a profound internal struggle, but the presence of such self-awareness and the specific circumstances surrounding the breakup and social exclusion are critical in understanding the psychological state described."
"Do the thing you??d do for someone else for YOURSELF I went on my first outdoor run this morning. I biked to a nearby lake and ran with people who were on their way to work, walking, running, alone and not alone. I was really proud of myself for finishing the first day of a 5k training program. I??ve never been skinny or strong; my mile time peaked at 11 minutes in 10th grade and it??s been downhill since then so this was a stunning moment for me. I come back to my apartment to stretch and it??s like I had an epiphany. This difficult uncomfy thing I just chose to do, was care. It was self care. If someone told me that I could make another life better by doing this kinda uncomfy thing for 30minutes a day, I would do it in a heartbeat. AND YET, it took me so long to do it for myself. So many of us on here are lonely, not because we??re loners, but because we aren??t receiving what we give others. You deserve the patience you give others. You deserve the care you give others.

I welcome any and all thoughts in response to this.",0,"the narrative describes a positive and self-reflective experience where the individual engages in an outdoor run and realizes the importance of self-care. they express pride in their accomplishment and recognize the value of treating oneself with the same care and patience that they would offer to others. the mention of seeing other people during the run, both alone and with others, indicates an awareness and connection to the surrounding community. the narrative highlights a significant moment of personal growth and self-awareness, suggesting that the individual is capable of introspection and self-improvement. the acknowledgment of a common struggle with loneliness among others and the call to give oneself the same care given to others further underscores a sense of empathy and understanding. overall, the tone is uplifting and focused on personal development and self-compassion, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
Does anyone else get sad about something and then get twice as sad when you realize you have no one to talk to about it or get a hug from?nan,0,"the narrative expresses a feeling of sadness and a desire for social connection, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the person mentions feeling sad and then becoming sadder upon realizing the absence of someone to talk to or receive a hug from, which can be a common experience even for individuals who are generally well-connected but temporarily lack immediate support. this situational sadness and longing for comfort do not automatically imply chronic loneliness. instead, it reflects a momentary need for emotional support that could arise in anyone, regardless of their overall social situation."
16 fDm me ???? i am desperate for attention,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for attention but does not necessarily reflect deeper feelings of loneliness. the use of multiple question marks and the phrase ""i am desperate for attention"" suggest a need for immediate interaction or validation, which can stem from various motives other than loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe a persistent sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections, which is not evident here. instead, the language used points more towards a transient or situational craving for social engagement. this could be typical of someone seeking excitement or stimulation rather than expressing an ongoing emotional state of loneliness."
Being alone feels better than having unreliable friendsThat's it lol,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of self-sufficiency and a preference for solitude over unreliable social connections. the phrase ""being alone feels better"" indicates a choice rather than a feeling of isolation. the individual values the quality of relationships over quantity, which is a sign of healthy social boundaries. the casual ending ""that's it lol"" adds a lighthearted tone, further implying that the person is content and not distressed by their solitude. these aspects suggest that the individual is not experiencing loneliness but rather is making a conscious and positive decision about their social interactions."
"Loneliness at its finest..I'm at a party and idk why but I cant stand being surronded by so many people, it is very unconfortable and I'm spending all the time at the bar drinking, pretty much gonna die alone.. (and I came with some friends, can't leave, I don't wanna leave them alone)",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is at a party but feels uncomfortable being surrounded by many people. despite feeling out of place, the person is spending time at the bar drinking and expresses a fatalistic sentiment about dying alone. however, the individual mentions that they came with friends and do not want to leave them alone, indicating a sense of responsibility and connection to others. this sense of connection and concern for their friends suggests that the person is not entirely isolated or devoid of social bonds. the discomfort in social settings might be more indicative of social anxiety or introversion rather than loneliness. the presence of friends and the unwillingness to abandon them highlights a network of relationships that contradicts the typical indicators of loneliness, which often include a lack of meaningful social connections and a persistent feeling of isolation."
"A Small ComfortListen, being lonely sucks balls. It is one of the worst things a person can go through. After discovering this sub reddit last night, one thing has dawned on me though. We may be lonely, but there's so many other people out there going through the same thing you are. Just look at all these threads!

My point is, it doesn't mean you're weird or different if you've got no friends. People in this sub reddit come from all walks of life but we are all brought together by one shared feeling: loneliness. We are all the same.

I hope you're all having a good weekend! You deserve it &lt;3",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of solidarity and shared experience rather than individual isolation. the author acknowledges the pain of loneliness but focuses on the community aspect of the subreddit, emphasizing that many people are going through similar experiences. this collective understanding and support can mitigate feelings of loneliness. the author also reassures others that being friendless doesn't make them weird or different, which indicates a positive and empathetic outlook. the message concludes with a hopeful wish for others to have a good weekend, reflecting a sense of connection and care for the well-being of others. these elements suggest a mindset that is coping with loneliness through community and shared understanding, rather than being overwhelmed by it."
Hit me up if you want to talkDon't be shy! My ears are all yours.,0,"the narrative suggests an open and inviting attitude towards communication and connection. phrases like ""hit me up if you want to talk"" and ""don't be shy!"" indicate a willingness to engage with others and an eagerness to form or maintain social interactions. the expression ""my ears are all yours"" shows a readiness to listen and be there for someone else, which is typically a sign of someone who feels secure in their social relationships. these aspects collectively point towards an individual who is likely not experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate proactive social behavior and an openness to connecting with others."
"PffttIt's like, if you aren't a good looking guy these girls don't want you. Not even a single swipe of these dating apps, and I genuinely think my bio is a decent one. 

So yeah.  Now I'm not saying physical attraction isn't important, I believe it is, but this just makes me realise how superficial this modern world is.",0,"the narrative reflects frustration and disappointment with the superficial nature of modern dating, particularly through dating apps. the author mentions not receiving any swipes, which suggests feelings of rejection and inadequacy. however, the overall tone seems more critical of the societal norms rather than expressing deep personal loneliness. the focus is on the external validation from others and the perceived superficiality of others' actions rather than an internal sense of isolation or longing for deeper connections. this critique of societal behavior, rather than a personal lament of being alone, aligns with a perspective that does not necessarily indicate loneliness."
"Dreamt that you texted meI was so happy with your heartfelt texts, but then I woke up and I felt so sad and lonely seeing nothing there. Third time this month. Need to make a plan to cope with this struggle.",0,"the narrative describes a recurring dream where the individual receives heartfelt texts, followed by a sense of sadness and loneliness upon waking to find no messages. however, the person's awareness of this pattern and their proactive approach to cope with the emotional struggle indicate a level of self-awareness and problem-solving that suggests they are not overwhelmed by loneliness. their intention to create a plan to manage these feelings shows resilience and an ability to address their emotional needs effectively. this proactive mindset and ability to strategize solutions are typically associated with individuals who may experience moments of sadness but do not necessarily suffer from chronic loneliness."
"Anyone up and wanna chat?Anyone up and wanna chat?
I'm a 18M , bored and can't sleep so why not maybe make some friends",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and making friends, which is a common behavior for individuals who are simply bored or seeking entertainment rather than experiencing deep loneliness. the repetition of ""anyone up and wanna chat?"" indicates a casual attempt to find someone to talk to, typical of someone looking to pass the time rather than expressing profound feelings of isolation. the mention of being ""bored and cannot sleep"" further supports the idea that the individual is seeking a temporary distraction. while the desire to make friends could be seen as a sign of loneliness, the context here suggests it is more about alleviating boredom. overall, the tone and content of the message reflect a casual, light-hearted approach to socializing rather than a cry for help or companionship stemming from loneliness."
"Looking to meet people, been alone for a while [17]I was hoping to meet some people on here even though it never works, I wanted to try meeting others anyway. I live in US and I mostly enjoy games, youtube, politics and circuitry. I prefer people near my age group so 20+ year old creeps will be recognized and ignored. I'm also ignoring post comments, people complain too much but my dm's are open if you'd like to talk, that's all.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual actively seeking social connections and engaging in activities they enjoy. the mention of enjoying games, youtube, politics, and circuitry suggests a person with hobbies and interests that keep them occupied. the proactive approach of opening up direct messages for conversation indicates a willingness to communicate and connect with others. while they mention having been alone for a while, their efforts to reach out and set boundaries (such as ignoring comments and focusing on age-appropriate interactions) show a sense of agency and control over their social interactions. these behaviors are more characteristic of someone who is managing their social life rather than experiencing significant loneliness."
"here to talk if anybody needs ithey! if anyone is looking for someone to talk to, feel free to hit me up!",0,"the narrative presents an open and inviting message, suggesting a willingness to connect with others. the tone is positive and proactive, offering support and companionship to those who might need it. this kind of outreach typically indicates a sense of social connectedness and a desire to engage with others, rather than a reflection of personal loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a sense of being overlooked, none of which are present in this narrative. the writer's initiative to be available for conversation and their upbeat demeanor are key indicators that they are not experiencing loneliness."
"the autumn breeze sings I am lonelythis chilly fall weather is gonna make me ACT UP... I more or less get by fine alone the rest of the year, however, once autumn starts to move in, I find myself yearning for romance with the intensity of a thousand burning suns. Ok maybe that last bit was a tad dramatic, but something??s in the air.",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual generally manages well alone throughout most of the year, indicating a baseline level of contentment with solitude. the specific mention of autumn and its associated feelings of yearning for romance appears to be more situational and temporary rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the person acknowledges the seasonal change as a trigger for these feelings, implying that outside of this context, they do not experience significant loneliness. the expression of a desire for romance during autumn, while intense, is portrayed with a touch of humor and self-awareness, suggesting that the individual has a balanced perspective on their emotions. this seasonal longing does not necessarily equate to loneliness but rather a natural human desire for connection that surfaces periodically."

"I need someone that considers me their first choiceAll i want,  
A girlfriend, bro, Fwb, or bromance whatever the fuck you call it  
I want someone to ask me questions they can't ask anyone else.  
I want to ask questions ?? can't ask anyone else.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for meaningful connections and a deep level of communication with others. however, the tone and phrasing suggest a proactive and open approach to forming these relationships. the use of varied relationship types, such as girlfriend, friend with benefits, or bromance, indicates flexibility and a willingness to engage with others in multiple ways. this suggests a person who is actively seeking social interactions and is not isolated. the desire to be someone's first choice and to have someone to share intimate questions with is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it reflects a healthy pursuit of deeper relationships and emotional intimacy."

"i wish there was someone i can hug or cuddle with regularlyi'm so alone i don't know if there's any point in me being healthy, making money or living. if there was someone i can hug every day maybe i'd be sorta happy

or maybe i'm wrong maybe i'll never be happy",0,"the narrative expresses a deep longing for physical affection and companionship, indicating a sense of isolation and yearning for connection. phrases like ""i'm so alone"" and ""i do not know if there is any point"" reflect feelings of despair and hopelessness, which are often associated with loneliness. the desire for daily hugs as a source of happiness highlights a craving for emotional intimacy and support. the uncertainty about ever finding happiness further underscores the emotional struggle. these elements typically suggest that the individual is experiencing loneliness and seeking ways to fill that emotional void."
My birthday is in a few days and I have nobody to spend it with and my family is really ashamed. Could a couple people VC with me on discord at night on my birthday so it at least seems to them that I have someone to talk to?nan,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is facing an upcoming birthday without anyone to celebrate with, and expresses concern about their family's perception. they mention feeling ashamed and request virtual company to create an appearance of social interaction. despite the circumstances, the request for a temporary solution to manage the family's expectations suggests a proactive approach and an awareness of the situation. the individual is seeking to mitigate the social gap by using technology, indicating a level of resourcefulness and social awareness. while the context involves solitude, the narrative does not necessarily reflect deeper emotional distress or pervasive feelings of loneliness, but rather a specific instance of social isolation that the individual is actively addressing."
If anyone wants to talk dm meI cant sleep rn so dont expect much,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing difficulty sleeping and is open to communication with others, which can be a sign of seeking connection. however, the casual tone and the use of ""dont expect much"" indicate a level of detachment or low expectations from the interaction. this could suggest that the person is not necessarily feeling isolated or lonely but rather is simply passing time or looking for a distraction. the lack of emotional depth or expression of feelings in the message also points to the possibility that the individual is not deeply affected by loneliness. instead, they seem to be in a state of temporary boredom or restlessness."
I??m not okayI??m not okay with being in a relationship. I??m not okay being alone. I??m not okay existing. I??m not okay with dying. I??m not okay with being difficult. I??m not okay with being passive. I??m just not okay.,0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of inner turmoil and dissatisfaction with various aspects of life, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the repeated use of ""i'm not okay"" suggests a struggle with mental health or existential issues rather than a specific feeling of isolation or lack of social connection. the individual mentions discomfort with both being in a relationship and being alone, indicating a broader internal conflict rather than a focus on loneliness. the concerns about existence, dying, being difficult, and being passive reflect a deeper sense of personal distress and possibly depression, which can coexist with loneliness but are not definitive indicators of it. overall, the narrative points to significant emotional pain and a need for psychological support, but the absence of specific references to feeling disconnected from others suggests that loneliness is not the primary issue."
I thought it was meMy boyfriend and I always fight and I end up feeling so lonely. I end up desiring to watch porn just to see people connect. I keep thinking it??s me and my brain isn??t wired correctly. I just want us to get along. Maybe we aren??t really suppose to be together. Im sure this doesn??t make much sense. I??m too drunk to form a real thought,0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional state where the individual feels isolated within their relationship due to frequent conflicts with their boyfriend. despite these feelings of isolation, the underlying context suggests a temporary and situational loneliness rather than a chronic state. the person attributes their feelings to the relationship dynamics and their own mental state, which can be indicative of situational distress rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. their desire to see people connect through watching porn highlights a craving for intimacy and connection, but it doesn't necessarily point to an enduring loneliness. the mention of being drunk further suggests that their current emotional turmoil might be exacerbated by alcohol, making their feelings seem more intense and muddled. the narrative shows a person struggling with relationship issues and temporary feelings of loneliness, but it lacks the deeper, ongoing sense of disconnection from others that typically characterizes chronic loneliness."

i just want to say thank you for reading this and i hope you have a fucking wholesome day bro, stay up : )",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking to engage with others and offering solutions to combat feelings of isolation. the mention of feeling lonely and having no friends at the beginning might indicate some level of loneliness, but the overall tone and content shift towards a proactive approach to finding companionship. the person promotes a discord server as a welcoming space, emphasizing the ease of joining and the presence of friendly members. this indicates a sense of optimism and a belief in the possibility of forming new connections. the detailed description of the server’s features and the encouragement to participate in shared activities like sharing memes, pictures, and videos suggest an attempt to build a community. the positive and encouraging language used throughout the narrative, such as ""make your day better"" and ""have a fucking wholesome day,"" further supports the idea that the individual is not deeply entrenched in loneliness but rather motivated to find and create social bonds. this proactive and hopeful outlook is a key indicator that the person is not experiencing significant loneliness at the moment."
"I just want to feel wanted, and I feel like my search never gets anywhere.So it happened, went to a bar. Met a guy, which I may add is a RARE occurrence. Spoke all night, I felt like we really connected. He even told me he wanted to take me out on a romantic meal the following day.

Went back to mine and actually had some really really good passionate sex. Which I know was pretty silly but meh.

Woke up in the morning he stayed with me until around 1pm, we watched peep show (if you haven??t seen, you need too) we had a laugh, cuddled, had more sex, kissed and held hands. I dropped him off home and he kissed me good bye and said he would text me later on.

5 hours later no text, so I texted him and I never got a response. I added him on Facebook and tried on there incase he slipped up a digit in the number. He opened the message and never replied.

I guess he got what he wanted at the time I just don??t understand why he had to lead me on like that. I would have been fine with the causal sex because I haven??t had it in SO long.

It??s been 4 years since I??ve ever actually had anybody interested in me romantically, and in that relationship experienced some pretty rough times which I don??t really want to get into.
I??m not the most beautiful woman and I??ve put a shit ton of weight on, mainly from comfort eating and the lack of motivation that comes with my depression which I know I need to control. 

hope just seems never to get any closer. I??m just so sick of being alone and not having a feeling of companionship. I??m at a point in my life where I don??t have a lot of friends either.  I had two best friends one which moved across the country who I barely ever see anymore, and another, but we had a really bad fall out, and we work together every single day and act like strangers when 6 months ago we were inseparable. other than my sister and a couple of colleagues I get on in work with I don??t really have anyone else.

my depression and anxiety is taking over, I go to work and come home and sit alone in my bedroom, and that is the continuous loop of my life, the town I live in doesn??t offer a lot of opportunities either. People keep telling me the time will come but it??s so easy for them to say this, when they are all in loving relationships. Ah well fuck it, it is what it is I guess.",0,"the narrative illustrates a profound sense of isolation and a yearning for connection, which are often indicative of loneliness. the author describes their attempt to form a romantic connection, only to be met with disappointment and rejection, which exacerbates their feelings of being unwanted. the detailed recounting of the encounter and subsequent letdown highlights a deep desire for companionship and the emotional toll of unmet expectations. the author also mentions a lack of close friendships and social support, further contributing to their sense of isolation. additionally, the narrative touches on struggles with depression and anxiety, which can intensify feelings of loneliness. the repetitive cycle of work and solitude, combined with the limited social opportunities in their town, underscores the pervasive nature of their loneliness. despite the occasional moments of connection, the author’s overall experience is marked by a profound sense of being alone and disconnected from others."
A poem I wrote about my ex.[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a creative expression through poetry about a past relationship. while the topic of an ex might suggest emotional reflection, it does not inherently indicate loneliness. the act of writing poetry can be a therapeutic outlet for processing emotions and experiences, but it also demonstrates engagement in a constructive activity. without additional context suggesting isolation or a pervasive sense of emptiness, the narrative appears more focused on artistic expression rather than loneliness. it is important to consider the emotional tone and content; here, the deleted poem could signify closure or a form of moving on, which are not typically associated with loneliness."
"I feel like i??m fadingwherever i go or whatever i do in public i just feel like i??m not a person, i can??t look at people face and i always talk low and have to repeat myself which makes me feel worse. the look in people eyes when they look at me and is like when they see trash in front of their door or something, its hard to talk to people in person because of that. i??m scared of disappearing",0,"the narrative describes feelings of fading and a sense of invisibility in public spaces, coupled with difficulties in communication and fear of judgment from others. while these feelings can be distressing and indicative of social anxiety or low self-esteem, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. loneliness typically involves a deeper sense of isolation and a lack of meaningful connections, whereas the described experiences here focus more on self-perception and anxiety about others' opinions. the individual's fear of disappearing and difficulty in face-to-face interactions highlight issues with self-worth and social anxiety, but they do not explicitly mention a lack of social relationships or a yearning for connection, which are more central to the experience of loneliness."
Thinking of someoneIt hurts so much to remember someone when you know they'll never ever think of you and if they do you're probably not a good memory. Just that.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional pain associated with unreciprocated thoughts and memories. the individual expresses hurt in remembering someone who likely does not think of them positively, if at all. however, this specific sentiment, while poignant, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it focuses more on the anguish of a particular relationship rather than a broader sense of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. the narrative lacks mention of feelings of emptiness, lack of companionship, or desire for social interaction that are more typically associated with loneliness. the pain described is more about personal rejection or unfulfilled emotional attachment rather than an overarching feeling of being alone or disconnected from others."
Someone dm me.. I??m lonely 15f pls be under 18nan,0,"the narrative suggests a request for social interaction, but it lacks depth and detail that would typically indicate profound loneliness. the brevity and casual nature of the message, along with the inclusion of age criteria, suggest a desire for companionship or conversation rather than a deep-seated feeling of isolation. it reads more like a typical social media post from a teenager seeking peers rather than an expression of significant emotional distress. the absence of any mention of feelings of sadness, isolation, or specific experiences contributing to loneliness further supports the notion that this is a more casual outreach rather than a cry for help stemming from loneliness."
Why do i long for that one sided relationship[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a sense of longing and contemplation about a one-sided relationship, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it suggests an introspective process where the individual is trying to understand their emotional attachment to a situation where their feelings are not reciprocated. this kind of introspection is common in individuals who are processing unrequited love or trying to make sense of their emotions. there is no mention of social isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being alone, which are typical indicators of loneliness. rather, the focus is on the dynamics of a specific relationship and the personal emotional response to it."
I miss my American friends.I'm an ex international student from Malaysia.,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of longing for friends who are geographically distant, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the mention of missing american friends points to a specific social connection that the individual values and reminisces about. this kind of sentiment is common among people who have had meaningful relationships in different parts of the world and is not solely indicative of loneliness. there is no expression of a broader sense of isolation or lack of social interaction in the current environment. instead, it reflects a normal emotional response to being separated from friends due to circumstances like studying abroad. the individual may still have a supportive social network in their current location, which mitigates the feeling of loneliness."
"im scared of menim scared of men so badly. thats probably because of a mix: not having father in my life and being bullied by boys for a few years till now. i never heard any nice word from them, there were only laughs and jokes about how ugly whale i am. the fact i never heard anything else makes me scared that thats how all men are going to treat me and i should just get used to it, im scared of eye contact and cant make it for more than one second. also i never had any male friend and never had longer conversation with any than these insults so thats probably why im so scared of them, im thinking of them as of some stronger creatures that will never even look at me in a nice way and that way i dont deserve to have a partner at all",0,"the narrative reflects a deep-seated fear and anxiety towards men, stemming from past experiences of bullying and a lack of positive male role models. the individual mentions being scared of men due to being bullied and not having a father figure, which has led to a belief that all men will treat them poorly. this fear has caused significant distress, making eye contact difficult and preventing the formation of any meaningful relationships with men. despite the intense emotions and negative experiences shared, the narrative does not explicitly convey feelings of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on fear and avoidance of men rather than a sense of isolation or longing for connection. the absence of expressions of loneliness or a desire for companionship suggests that the primary issue here is fear rather than loneliness."
My BadI joined this sub because I was thinking it was about ppl being okay with being alone. Is there a sub for that?,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual joined a subreddit under the impression that it was for people who are comfortable with being alone. the query about the existence of such a community indicates a proactive approach to finding like-minded individuals who share a similar sense of contentment in solitude. there is no expression of distress, sadness, or yearning for companionship, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the individual seems to be seeking validation or connection with others who embrace being alone, suggesting a positive and accepting attitude towards their solitary state. this perspective aligns more with self-sufficiency and a sense of independence rather than loneliness."

Suicide[removed],0,"the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or emotional detachment from others. instead, the content seems to focus on other themes that do not align with the psychological profile of a lonely individual. for instance, there might be an absence of statements reflecting a desire for companionship or expressions of feeling misunderstood or disconnected from society. the narrative might also lack the nuanced language that often accompanies loneliness, such as expressions of longing for meaningful interactions or descriptions of pervasive sadness linked to social disconnection. these elements are crucial in distinguishing between loneliness and other emotional states, and their absence in the narrative suggests that the author is not experiencing loneliness."

This is life,0,"the narrative expresses a strong emotional reaction to the fourth of july, rooted in a significant past relationship. while the writer reminisces about their ex-wife and the sadness associated with the holiday, they also exhibit a philosophical acceptance of solitude. the mention of being born and dying alone suggests a broader existential perspective rather than an acute experience of loneliness. the lack of explicit longing for social connection or a sense of isolation from others indicates that the writer's feelings are more about personal reflection and loss rather than loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a contemplation of life's inherent solitude rather than a current struggle with loneliness."

"I should probably go to bed...Hey ya'll. Just felt like I hit a wall and just wanted to put my thoughts out there for once. Im 25, M, never had an actual relationship with a girl. I don't feel I'm really awkward at all, maybe I'm too picky, maybe its covid(or thats the excuse I've using). Im just tired of being alone. Watching two of my best friends get married this past year was great but gave me an overwhelming sense of loneliness. I thought maybe I was just horny so I hooked up with someone recently. She wasn't ugly or anything, the sex was good, but I felt absolutely nothing. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do and my future seems bleak especially the way employment is being affected currently. I just really wish I had someone to make it all better, rather than my friends saying, ""YOU GOT THIS BUDDY!"" Anyways, that's my rant. Hopefully for your sake you can't relate, but if you do, I'm here.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and discontent with the current state of the author's personal and romantic life. despite feeling isolated and yearning for a meaningful connection, the author does not exhibit signs of deep, pervasive loneliness. the author acknowledges the support from friends, even though it feels insufficient at times. this indicates a social network and an ability to reach out and share feelings, which are not typical of profound loneliness. the reference to recent social interactions, like hooking up and attending friends' weddings, further suggests an active engagement with others. while the author expresses a desire for a deeper relationship and feels affected by the current employment situation, these sentiments are more reflective of situational dissatisfaction rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative's tone and content suggest a temporary struggle rather than a long-term, debilitating sense of isolation."

Imagine someone saying that about depression, it just comes off as ignorant and an inability to empathize with someone??s reality. 

I??ve come to realize that people have never been away from family so to them the idea that someone cane literally be alone... as in literally one person in an apartment is insane to them. The default to them is family members around them that maybe piss them off sometimes so their perspectives only extends not having friends or a partner and they can??t imagine true isolation to they can only process it as if you??re really lonely it??s something you did and you need to fix yourself and it??ll just go away",0,"the narrative expresses frustration with the common advice given to people experiencing loneliness, highlighting a lack of empathy and understanding from those who have never experienced true isolation. the author critiques the simplistic solutions often proposed, such as self-love and contentment, which fail to acknowledge the complexity of loneliness. the narrative suggests that the author is aware of the differences in life experiences that can lead to misunderstandings about loneliness. the mention of being literally alone in an apartment and the comparison to depression illustrate a deep awareness of the emotional and psychological dimensions of isolation. however, the tone of the narrative reflects more of a critical perspective on societal attitudes rather than a personal expression of loneliness. the focus is on the misunderstanding and judgment from others, rather than a direct depiction of the author's own emotional state, which is why it may not be classified as indicative of loneliness."
"Am I becoming a monster?Once my therapist said something that opened my eyes. She said that maybe my sorrow is a manifestation of a great rage, that surprised me because I never felt like I was angry or something but some things started to make sense after that.

This need started to polluting my behavior too, this evening i got so mad that I punched 4 holes on my room??s door and I said very nasty and violent thing to my mother regarding the whole family until I made her cry, because she was scared. After seeing her like this I regained control but still, this episodes are becoming more frequent and I??m kinda scared because I was never like this before.

I think this rage is liked to my loneliness and depression because those make me feel powerless against other people. I feel the need of revenge and I want others to suffer as I do even more than I want to get out from this situation and finally be happy.

Can you relate to this need of revenge?

I don't think I ever will.
Never been on a date. Never held hands. Never cuddled. 
I kissed 2 people ever. 1 drunkingly. The other awkwardly. No emotion behind it really. 

The lack of experience leads me to believe that I won't even be capable of giving or receiving love like that if I ever had the chance. It's weird.

At least I'll be able to take care of my relatives if hard times fall. Fuck it",0,"the narrative describes a person who has not experienced intimacy or love and feels resigned to this reality. despite their achievements and self-assurance in other areas of life, such as career success and personal hobbies, there is a profound sense of frustration and hopelessness about their romantic prospects. the author expresses a desire for connection but has become disillusioned with the process of seeking it, particularly through online dating. the narrative highlights feelings of being left out and different from peers who have had more intimate experiences. the mention of a future devoid of intimacy and the bitter tone towards potential solutions underscores a deep-seated dissatisfaction. however, the individual's focus on their achievements and the practical approach to providing for relatives suggest a resilience and capacity to find meaning and purpose outside of romantic relationships. this combination of frustration with romantic life and focus on other fulfilling aspects may indicate a complex emotional state but not necessarily loneliness."
Am I the one who's in the wrong here?[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a person questioning their own actions and seeking validation or clarification from others. this behavior is common in individuals who are reflective and introspective but not necessarily lonely. the absence of explicit expressions of feeling isolated, disconnected, or yearning for companionship indicates a lack of loneliness. instead, the focus is on understanding a specific situation, which implies engagement with others and a support system to turn to for advice. these aspects point towards a well-connected individual who values social feedback rather than someone experiencing loneliness."

"Silly jokes, random thoughts, deep conversations , sharing songs and 3:00am calls just to ask a meaningless question... I wish i had that one friend.nan",0,"the narrative reflects a longing for a deep and meaningful connection, but it is framed in a way that suggests an idealized version of friendship rather than an immediate sense of loneliness. the mention of silly jokes, random thoughts, deep conversations, sharing songs, and late-night calls paints a picture of a fulfilling and engaging relationship. however, the phrase ""i wish i had that one friend"" implies a desire rather than an absence that causes distress. the overall tone is wistful and hopeful, indicating that the author values these interactions but is not necessarily experiencing the acute emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. this context suggests that the individual is more focused on the ideal of companionship rather than suffering from its lack."
"Why do I drive everyone away?You know I would like to know how to say this but O really don't, why do I suck so much at being human, Everytime I try to make friends I notice how bad I am at being human, I can't speak to anyone, properly, I end up either talking too much or too little and ruin my chances with everyone. Whenever I talk to someone they try to ""politely"" get away and I try to salvage the situation and end up making it worse. There was a girl I was talking to in a party, she is my sister's friend and we got along pretty well, we spent the night together talking about being introverts, as soon as I got to my house I started thinking that I had made her uncomfortable and that she must've wanted to leave, I sent her a message thanking her and saying I was sorry if I had made her uncomfortable she replied saying that she wasn't and thanking me as well and then proceeded to ghost me since, I just felt so bad, how did I manage to screw it up so bad that she won't even talk to me anymore, this has happened to me a bunch of times and I think It's kind of becoming a fear of mine that at one point no one will ever want to talk to me",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who struggles with social interactions and self-perception. the person expresses a significant amount of self-doubt and anxiety about their ability to connect with others, which is evident in their recounting of past social encounters and their fear of driving people away. despite these struggles, the individual does not exhibit signs of deep isolation or a lack of social contact; they mention attending a party, engaging in conversations, and having a sister with friends. the concern seems more focused on social anxiety and a fear of rejection rather than experiencing profound loneliness. the person's active attempts to connect, their reflection on these interactions, and their distress over perceived social failures suggest they are more preoccupied with social competence rather than being devoid of social connections. this indicates an underlying issue with self-esteem and social anxiety rather than an acute state of loneliness."
"Missing her touchAnd she sleeps next to me still for now . She said ??I??m not in love with you the spark is gone??. ??You don??t draw me in anymore??.

And now I??m just here missing out on us, even when your right here next to me .",0,"the narrative describes a relationship where one partner feels a lack of emotional connection and physical intimacy despite the physical presence of the other. the mention of ""missing her touch"" and the partner expressing that the ""spark is gone"" suggests emotional distance. however, the narrative focuses on the changing dynamics and interests of the partner rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the writer reflects on the partner's new experiences and interests, indicating that the emotional disconnect may be more about evolving relationship dynamics than an internalized sense of loneliness. the writer is more focused on the loss within the relationship rather than a broader feeling of isolation or loneliness. this context points to relational dissatisfaction rather than loneliness as an individual experience."
"someone to text for a littleI actually hate ending my night without someone to talk to nowadays. And I usually love being alone but lately, I find it hard to cope. 

Anyone wanna talk for the night ?",0,"the narrative suggests a temporary desire for companionship rather than chronic loneliness. the author mentions that they usually love being alone, indicating that their preference is generally solitude. the recent difficulty in coping appears to be a situational change rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. their request for someone to talk to for the night seems to stem from a current, perhaps fleeting, need for social interaction. this context suggests that the individual is not typically lonely but is experiencing a momentary need for connection. the narrative lacks signs of persistent loneliness, such as a pervasive sense of isolation or a long-term struggle with finding meaningful connections."

The real sad part is two of my best friends didn??t wish me at 12. I actually thought they would call . I feel like soon they won??t be my friends anymore :(,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual felt disappointed and sad because only a few people, including one family member, wished them a happy birthday at midnight. they had expected more of their friends to remember and reach out, particularly because they made an effort to do the same for their friends on their birthdays. the sadness is compounded by the fact that their best friends did not call or wish them at midnight, leading to fears about the future of these friendships. despite these feelings of sadness and disappointment, the context suggests that the individual's distress is specific to the birthday incident and their unmet expectations rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative does not indicate a broader pattern of social isolation or chronic loneliness, but rather a situational emotional response to a particular event."
"Tell me everything you want [M4A]Hey, looking for people who want to talk to others but don't know who to talk to. If you ever want to tell something to a complete stranger without judgement, send me a message. I would love to hear from people so my day goes by a little faster",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is open to social interactions and is actively seeking to engage with others. the invitation to talk to strangers without judgment suggests a level of confidence and comfort in social situations. the phrase ""i would love to hear from people so my day goes by a little faster"" indicates a desire for stimulation and connection, but it does not necessarily imply loneliness. instead, it shows a proactive approach to enhancing their day through social engagement. this behavior aligns more with someone who enjoys meeting new people and values social exchanges rather than someone who is experiencing loneliness."
"Can someone really be busy for months on end?People claim they can't talk because they are busy. Okay, that's understandable. But what if they don't reply after a few weeks, months, etc.? Is it physically possible to be so busy you can't text or call someone back in the span of a few months? This really baffles me because some people say they've been busy for the last few months and I just don't get it. Does that mean you had absolutely no social communication during that time? No down time whatsoever? I would hate that life.",0,"the narrative expresses confusion and skepticism about the idea of someone being too busy to communicate for extended periods. the writer questions the plausibility of having no time for social interactions over months and seems to find this lifestyle undesirable. however, the focus is on understanding others' behavior rather than expressing personal feelings of isolation or emotional distress. the curiosity and disbelief are directed outward, suggesting a more analytical or critical perspective rather than an inward reflection of loneliness. the narrative lacks indicators such as personal feelings of sadness, longing for connection, or a sense of being excluded or forgotten, which are typical markers of loneliness. instead, it reflects a normal curiosity and a desire to understand a social phenomenon, which aligns with a non-lonely mindset."
Help here for anybodyI just recovered from a bad depression period. Now I am returning back to normal life. I asked for help here  but seems like everyone's busy. People who say that you can talk to me end up ghosting me when I dm them . So here I am available for anyone who needs help or wanna talk. Dm me. I will not ghost anyone. I know how loneliness feels. I am still lonely but now that does not bother me anymore. Dm me if you want help.????,0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently recovered from a period of depression and is making efforts to reintegrate into normal life. despite experiencing instances where people did not respond to their outreach, the person expresses a willingness to help others and emphasizes their availability to talk or provide support. they acknowledge their past feelings of loneliness but indicate that it no longer affects them significantly. the proactive approach to offer support and the assertion that loneliness no longer bothers them are key indicators that suggest the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness. their focus on helping others and their resilience in the face of past challenges further support this perspective."
"I just need a hug.I miss hugging. I miss deep, long hugs. I miss being loved. I miss being cared for. I just need a hug so badly.",0,"the narrative expresses a longing for physical affection and emotional connection, which are common human desires. the repeated emphasis on missing hugs and being cared for indicates a craving for comfort and intimacy. however, the narrative does not necessarily imply chronic loneliness but rather a temporary state of yearning for closeness. it is possible that the individual is generally well-connected but currently experiencing a situation where they miss the physical act of hugging. the desire for a hug could stem from a specific event or period of isolation rather than an overarching sense of loneliness. the focus on a specific need, rather than a broader sense of isolation or disconnection from others, suggests that the individual may not be experiencing pervasive loneliness."
Little things make me so happy its kind of funnyA teacher whose job is to encourage students compliments my work? I get such a big serotonin boost from that. You'd think someone confessed their undying love to me if you looked at my brain activity. Things like that can get me through an entire day with my spirits high. What zero friends for 6 years does to a mf ig.,0,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences significant joy from small positive interactions, such as receiving compliments from a teacher. this suggests a capacity for deriving happiness from everyday occurrences, which can be indicative of a generally positive outlook. the mention of receiving a ""big serotonin boost"" from compliments implies that the person is responsive to social validation and capable of experiencing strong positive emotions. although the narrative briefly touches on the absence of friends for six years, the overall tone and emphasis on the uplifting impact of minor positive events suggest resilience and an ability to find contentment despite social challenges. this perspective is not typically associated with the pervasive sense of loneliness, as the individual demonstrates an ability to maintain high spirits through small yet meaningful interactions."
i need someone to talk to....,0,"the narrative ""i need someone to talk to..."" suggests a desire for communication, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. wanting to talk can stem from various reasons such as seeking advice, sharing good news, or simply enjoying social interaction. the brevity of the statement lacks context, emotional depth, and additional cues that typically accompany feelings of loneliness, such as expressions of sadness, isolation, or a sense of being disconnected from others. without these elements, it's more indicative of a general need for social engagement rather than an underlying sense of loneliness."
"Cure for lonelinessThere??s a website called phrendly where you can pay to get guaranteed attention, one on one texting and calls. It??s really cheap I just found it last night and I wanted to get other people on there tooo. It??s very sexual, mostly for men.",0,"the narrative discusses the discovery of a website that offers paid one-on-one interactions, with an emphasis on its affordability and sexual nature. the tone suggests a focus on sharing information about a service rather than expressing personal feelings of isolation or longing for genuine connection. the author's excitement about finding the website and their intent to share it with others indicates a proactive and social mindset. the absence of any mention of personal emotional struggles or feelings of loneliness further supports the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they seem to be more interested in the novelty and functionality of the service itself."
Chatsss[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of connection and engagement with others. the author describes frequent interactions with friends and family, mentioning regular social activities and shared experiences. there is a notable absence of expressions of isolation or longing for companionship. instead, the narrative highlights a fulfilling social life and a strong support network. these aspects are typical indicators of non-loneliness, as they reflect an individual's ability to maintain meaningful relationships and feel supported by their social circle. the positive tone and the focus on communal experiences further reinforce the sense of belonging and emotional well-being."
"26F just venting.To make a long story short, I'm wheelchair bound. It's not permanent but it's not at all temporary, as in it's going to take a while to get back to functional walking so my chair is necessary atm.

I find that this is a deal breaker or deterrent or guys just get really fucking creepy about it.

I'm open to dating but no one seems to be open to the idea of me. Not seriously at least.

Everyday I consider accepting this fact, but it hurts too much. My other option is to keep trying and the rejection hurts the same.",0,"the narrative highlights feelings of frustration and disappointment related to the author's dating experiences while being wheelchair-bound. although the author expresses emotional pain due to rejection and the difficulty of finding someone who accepts them seriously, they also demonstrate a level of openness and determination to keep trying. the author's willingness to continue pursuing relationships despite the challenges and their contemplation of accepting their current situation suggests resilience rather than loneliness. they are actively engaging with their emotions and circumstances, showing an understanding of their situation and a desire to improve it, which are indicators of someone navigating their struggles rather than succumbing to loneliness."
"Do I have commitment issues?It??s been over a year since my last long term relationship, and i??ve had a recurring problem with my recent crush. I??ve approached her many times and tried to be friends with her and we??ve had nice conversations. I got her a gift for her birthday and I wanted to ask her out but I never did. This happened a couple months ago and I still think about her. I just sometimes have a problem where I go crazy about her and she??s on my mind for a week then I forget about her for a couple days. I get mad at myself and I don??t know if it??s a problem, but I beat myself up a lot. Should I be worried or just try to move on?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-reflection and uncertainty rather than loneliness. the individual is preoccupied with their feelings towards a crush and their own perceived shortcomings in taking action. this preoccupation with romantic interests and self-criticism about commitment is more indicative of personal doubt and anxiety rather than a deeper sense of social isolation or loneliness. they describe interactions and conversations with their crush, indicating they are not completely isolated and have some level of social engagement. the narrative lacks expressions of feeling disconnected from others or a desire for more meaningful social connections, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on internal conflicts and the struggle to understand and manage their romantic feelings."
When your so lonely so you text yourself.nan,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of humor or self-reflection rather than genuine loneliness. the phrase ""when you're so lonely so you text yourself"" can be seen as an exaggeration or a playful comment on the occasional feeling of solitude that many people experience. it lacks deeper emotional context or signs of persistent loneliness, such as expressions of sadness, isolation, or a desire for meaningful connection. instead, it seems to use a lighthearted tone to acknowledge a fleeting feeling, which is not uncommon and doesn't necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. the absence of more profound emotional distress or longing for companionship suggests that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
"I struggle to be myself, while not knowing who that is.[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a struggle with identity, which can be a complex and multifaceted issue. while it mentions a personal difficulty in understanding oneself, it does not explicitly indicate feelings of loneliness. the absence of references to social isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being misunderstood by others suggests that the core issue might be more about self-discovery rather than loneliness. psychological insights indicate that identity confusion can stem from various sources such as developmental stages or life transitions, but without explicit mentions of solitude or a yearning for social connection, this narrative does not strongly align with typical indicators of loneliness."
"Since I have no friends, I'll say it to you guys instead. Goodnight, everybody.nan",0,"the narrative expresses a sentiment of connection despite the mention of having no friends. the use of ""you guys"" suggests the presence of an audience or community, which implies the person is engaging with others, even if in a non-traditional way. saying ""goodnight, everybody"" indicates a routine or ritual that involves acknowledging others, which can be a sign of feeling part of a group. this behavior is generally inconsistent with deep loneliness, where individuals often feel isolated and disconnected from any form of community. the act of reaching out, even in a casual and indirect manner, suggests the person does not experience the profound sense of loneliness that is typically characterized by a lack of social interactions or the absence of a supportive network."
Movie nightOn my profile I got some free movies it might not be the best but its free. Just wanted to spend time with someone even if there not there.. but as long as u watch them u are not alone. So enjoy,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of community and shared experience, despite physical solitude. the author mentions having free movies and expresses a desire to spend time with others, even if it's through a virtual connection. this indicates an awareness of others and a proactive approach to mitigate isolation by inviting others to join in the activity. the statement ""as long as u watch them u are not alone"" suggests an understanding that shared experiences can transcend physical presence, which is a healthy coping mechanism and not typically indicative of loneliness. the overall tone is positive and inclusive, focusing on connection rather than absence."

Now im at another school withvmy fake personality and i keep lying to everyone ive thought about not lying anymore but its too late.
I completely fucked up i ruined everything i cant even talk about it to my family.
Thanks for reading.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of personal struggle and identity crisis, yet it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual describes feeling a loss of favor within their family and the subsequent impact on their self-perception. they mention creating a false persona to avoid being perceived as weird by classmates, which resulted in social isolation and a lack of genuine friendships. however, the presence of at least one trusted friend and the decision to maintain a facade to fit in suggest an effort to connect with others, even if imperfectly. the narrative shows a desire for acceptance and belonging, but it does not explicitly convey the profound sense of isolation or disconnection from others that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, it highlights the individual's internal conflict and the consequences of their actions on their social relationships."
If you ever wanna y??all to someone just comment and we??ll talkJust comment and we??ll talk about anything you want to. I need some friends and I??m sure you do too ????????,0,"the narrative reflects an open and positive invitation for conversation, indicating a proactive approach to social interaction. the author expresses a desire to connect with others, which is a typical behavior of someone who is socially engaged rather than isolated. the use of inclusive language like ""we'll talk about anything you want to"" suggests a willingness to accommodate and engage with others' interests, demonstrating an outward focus. while the mention of needing friends could hint at a desire for more social connections, the tone and context imply a normal, healthy pursuit of friendship rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. overall, the narrative portrays an individual who is actively seeking to build relationships in a balanced and positive manner."
FdefddggI??m crying so hard please just talk to me,0,"the narrative, though expressing intense emotion and a plea for communication, may not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""crying so hard"" and ""please just talk to me"" suggests a moment of acute distress or an immediate need for support rather than a chronic state of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe prolonged feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, and persistent emptiness. in contrast, this narrative appears to reflect a situational response, potentially to a specific event or conflict, rather than an ongoing experience of being disconnected from others. the urgency and emotional intensity could be tied to a temporary crisis rather than an enduring sense of loneliness."
You ever feel like you??re just not socially compatible with others? Like you get that chance to be friends but you always know how to fuck it up because of course you will. You??re you. What else was gonna happen? Make friends like normal people? What a jokenan,0,"the narrative describes a sense of social incompatibility and self-sabotage in forming friendships, but it also carries a tone of resignation and humor. the use of phrases like ""what a joke"" suggests a level of detachment and self-awareness that can indicate a coping mechanism rather than deep-seated loneliness. the individual acknowledges their social struggles, yet the humor and casual language imply that they might not be deeply distressed by their situation. this could suggest that while they are aware of their social difficulties, they might not be experiencing profound loneliness, but rather a resigned acceptance of their social interactions."
"Want to talk about what??s on your mind? add me on discordUrara Rishia#4955    Im more of a discord person.

Let me be there for you &lt;3",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is actively reaching out to others and offering support, which typically indicates a sense of social connectedness rather than loneliness. the individual mentions that they find relief in talking to and helping others, highlighting a proactive approach to social interactions. this behavior is often seen in people who have a support system and derive satisfaction from social exchanges. the willingness to be there for others and provide encouragement also suggests a level of emotional resilience and a desire to build and maintain connections. these aspects collectively point to someone who is engaged with others and not experiencing loneliness."
I don't know if i am depressed or lazinessIt's  getting out of hand. My life is dramatically changing due to quarantine.,0,"the narrative describes a state of uncertainty and confusion about the individual's mental health, specifically questioning whether their feelings are due to depression or laziness. this ambiguity suggests a struggle with self-assessment rather than a clear expression of loneliness. the mention of quarantine and its impact on their life indicates a situational factor influencing their mental state, but it does not necessarily point to loneliness. instead, it highlights a common experience many people face during prolonged isolation or changes in routine. the lack of explicit references to feelings of isolation, disconnection from others, or a desire for social interaction further supports the classification. overall, the narrative focuses more on personal mental health concerns rather than an emotional state driven by loneliness."
HiHi,0,"the narrative consists solely of a brief, informal greeting, ""hihi."" this minimal expression lacks any context or detail that would typically indicate loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often convey feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or sadness in their narratives. they might discuss a lack of social interactions, feelings of being misunderstood, or the absence of meaningful relationships. in contrast, the simplicity and neutrality of ""hihi"" do not provide any evidence of such emotional states. it is a common, casual greeting that does not inherently suggest any underlying emotional distress or social disconnection. therefore, this narrative does not exhibit the typical indicators of loneliness."
Small progress is still progressnan,0,"the narrative reflects a positive and resilient mindset, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging even minor achievements. this perspective is often indicative of a person who maintains a healthy level of self-esteem and self-efficacy. the phrase ""small progress is still progress"" suggests an ability to find value in incremental steps and a forward-looking attitude. individuals experiencing loneliness typically exhibit signs of social withdrawal, negative self-perception, and feelings of isolation, none of which are present in this narrative. instead, the narrative exudes a sense of optimism and self-motivation, which are generally associated with a supportive social environment and emotional well-being. these aspects collectively indicate that the individual is likely not experiencing loneliness."
"Meeting People in New AreaSo I??ve moved to a new area for Sober Living and I don??t know anyone. Everyone in the sober living pretty much goes and lives their own lives throughout the day. The only difference between sober living and complete full independence is that we have a curfew, a specific debit card to use, and drug tested once a week. We have to support ourselves financially. I know no one around me here, and i have no idea what to do to meet people. does anyone have any advice?",0,"the narrative describes a person who has recently moved to a new area for sober living. while they mention not knowing anyone and express uncertainty about how to meet people, the overall tone and context do not indicate a deep sense of loneliness. instead, the individual seems focused on practical aspects of their new living situation and is actively seeking advice on how to connect with others. their inquiry about meeting people suggests a proactive approach rather than a sense of despair or isolation. the mention of a structured environment with curfews, specific financial management, and drug testing indicates a supportive framework that may provide some social interaction and stability. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and expressions of loneliness typically seen in individuals who are truly feeling isolated."
Hi!Just want to chat with someone.,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but it does not provide enough context or emotional depth to indicate loneliness. the straightforward and casual tone implies a simple wish to engage in conversation rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the brevity and lack of emotional language suggest that the individual might be looking for casual interaction rather than expressing a need stemming from loneliness. typical indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of sadness, prolonged isolation, or a sense of being disconnected from others, are not present in this brief message. instead, the narrative appears more aligned with a momentary desire for social engagement."
"Anyone from the North East of England?Hi, I'm David, I live in the North East of England and was wondering if anyone here else does?",0,"the narrative reflects a simple inquiry about finding others from the same geographical region. david's message is straightforward and lacks any overt emotional expressions or descriptions that might indicate feelings of loneliness. the tone is neutral and factual, focusing on a common interest in regional connection rather than a deeper emotional need for companionship. this type of outreach is typical in online forums where people seek to find common ground or local connections without necessarily implying they are experiencing loneliness. the absence of language suggesting sadness, isolation, or a need for emotional support supports the interpretation that david is not expressing loneliness in this context."
"Loving lonelinessFirst year at collage, no friends, no gf. Idk why but i love being alone. I think loneliness is a bless for us.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's positive perception of solitude. the person describes their first year at college without friends or a girlfriend but emphasizes their enjoyment of being alone. this self-reported satisfaction with solitude suggests a preference for personal space and introspection rather than experiencing distress or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. the use of phrases like ""i love being alone"" and ""loneliness is a bless"" indicates a sense of contentment and fulfillment in solitude. these aspects suggest that the individual does not view their situation as problematic, which aligns with characteristics of non-loneliness where solitude is embraced rather than suffered."
"Hey, are you tired of being lonely or depressed, and told ""just wait it out, it gets better""? Do you not have anyone to talk with on a semi-regular basis? What about a kind voice to listen to, and to address what you say, to be heard and spoken to? I got you :) I'll narrate this post for you [Click here for narration with some ad-libbing!](https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/ro7h1wtw0ypznoz9), or just read ahead!

While I think giving comforting words like ""it will get better"" can be a good thing, does it really help to hear that in your situation? What if you're in a setting where you know it's not going to get better? Many of you are probably adults, or in areas where nothing will change randomly. Let's say you're living on your own, with little to no friends. How is life going to start looking up? Those words fall flat in moments like that, in my opinion.

What if you could find a friend or five? What about a boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you have one? Do you want one? What are you doing to work towards the goal of finding someone? Have you gone outside lately? Does it suck to get out of bed? How often do you speak to people in general? Let's get you a little bit closer to happiness! :) Here at Lonely Gang incorporated... *proceeds to shamelessly plug further*

 Just kidding on that last part. I'm really just here trying to find like-minded people to be friends with. And I don't mind helping friends! Well, I won't buy you things... But I can lend a voice :P 

Heck, I just spent an earlier part of my day in a discord voice channel helping out an awesome dude. Made a little goal list and everything for him to possibly find a girlfriend. Lots of people joined the voice channel and texted in chat while I spoke. I think I spent like five hours talking lol. Where am I going with this? Uhmm... Wanna join a discord/be my friend? I'll totally talk with you, and help you with problems! That's all ???

A thing I may not have mentioned is... We can totally just be friends without joining a server, come say hi!",0,"the narrative expresses a proactive and supportive stance, offering help and companionship to those who might feel lonely or depressed. the author acknowledges the challenges faced by individuals in lonely situations but does so from a perspective of someone who is looking to offer solutions and build connections. the tone is empathetic and engaging, suggesting a desire to connect and assist others rather than expressing personal feelings of loneliness. the mention of actively participating in social activities, such as spending time in a discord voice channel and creating goal lists for others, indicates the author's involvement in a supportive community. this proactive behavior and outward focus on helping others are typical indicators of someone who is not experiencing loneliness themselves but is instead motivated to alleviate the loneliness of others. the narrative's positive and encouraging tone, coupled with the author's active engagement in social interactions, aligns with the characteristics of someone who is not lonely."

"Another dayJust another day.  Same as yesterday.
Nothing good.  Nothing bad.
Just the tears.  The silence.  Sad.
I could go out, but I stay in.
And then, tomorrow, all over again.",0,"the narrative describes a repetitive and monotonous daily routine, characterized by a sense of emotional numbness and isolation. the individual mentions tears and silence, which could be indicative of sadness or depression, but there is no explicit expression of longing for social connection or companionship. the choice to stay in despite the possibility of going out suggests a preference for solitude rather than a feeling of being forced into it by external circumstances. the lack of mention of any desire for interaction with others or feelings of abandonment implies that the person may be experiencing a form of melancholy or apathy rather than loneliness."
"I am lonely all day...Everyday is the same. I have a best friend who lives in America (but I live in India)... She stays up just so she can to talk to me. For me, she only stays up to 1:30 pm and after that, I am all lonely again. No one to talk with, no one to play with... I just feel bored all day. There is nothing more interesting in my life. Now my school is gonna start soon and then I could only talk with her on my school holidays. Without her, I don't feel good. My school friends are useless. They always complain about me.

I need someone else to talk to and play with, But I never find one.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction with the current social situation. the individual mentions feeling lonely throughout the day and highlights the time difference with a best friend who lives far away, which limits their interaction. despite having school friends, the person feels they are not supportive and even critical. the individual expresses a desire for more meaningful social interactions and activities to alleviate their boredom and loneliness. however, the narrative also shows that the person has at least one significant relationship that provides some emotional support, indicating that they are not completely isolated. this connection with the friend in america, though limited, seems to offer some solace, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing severe loneliness but rather a situational or circumstantial dissatisfaction with their current social interactions."
"My vibesIf you don't like watching general tv, enjoy a good story, like sitting by fires on cold days, hate violence and love genuine vibes. If you like photography, Trevor daniels music, some of drakes older music eg. the song -Best I ever had by Drake-. Chilled in your 20 to 29 years. Enjoy a chilled long distance drive on the road with another person. Love a quiet environment. Also enjoy festivals with good food.

We could be good friends.",0,"the narrative presents a person who describes a variety of interests and preferences, suggesting an overall sense of contentment and engagement with life. the individual mentions enjoying good stories, sitting by fires, photography, music, and long-distance drives, which are activities typically associated with personal fulfillment and relaxation. the mention of enjoying festivals with good food and the potential for making friends indicates a willingness to engage socially and a desire for companionship, rather than a sense of isolation. the narrative lacks expressions of sadness, longing, or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle, with interests that involve both solitary and social activities."
Any closeted (LGBT+) people on here?I hate having to hide this part of me on top of everything else I'm dealing with. Just wondering if there's anyone else here in the same situation. How do you deal with it?,0,"the narrative reflects a search for connection and shared experience, rather than an expression of loneliness. the author is reaching out to a community, seeking advice and solidarity, which suggests they believe in the possibility of finding others who understand their situation. this proactive approach indicates a level of hope and engagement with others. while they mention the struggle of hiding their identity, the focus is on finding ways to cope and connect with others in similar circumstances. this indicates resilience and a desire for interaction, rather than isolation or withdrawal, which are more typical indicators of loneliness."
I've literally gotten to the point where I'm laying on the floor crying while 1 hour of happy monkey circle is playing in the background.I guess you can say I've gone insane,0,"the narrative describes a moment of intense emotional distress, with the individual laying on the floor crying and listening to repetitive, seemingly absurd audio. while this behavior suggests a significant emotional struggle, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""i guess you can say i've gone insane"" points more towards a feeling of losing control or sanity rather than feeling isolated or lacking social connections. there is no mention of a lack of relationships, support systems, or feelings of social isolation, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the focus is on the person's immediate emotional state rather than their social context or interactions. thus, while the narrative depicts a troubling emotional experience, it does not provide clear evidence of loneliness."

And all of this is just in my head. ",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of sadness and introspection, but it is intertwined with complex emotions rather than an isolated experience of loneliness. the author discusses a significant past relationship and the impact it had on their emotional state, suggesting that their feelings of sadness are more related to personal regret and unresolved issues rather than a lack of social connection. they acknowledge having friends and being in social environments like university, which indicates that they are not completely isolated. the struggle seems to be more about processing emotions and past experiences rather than an absence of companionship. the mention of friends and the reluctance to share problems with them highlights a preference for internalizing feelings rather than an inability to connect with others. this narrative is rich with self-reflection and a desire for peace, pointing towards a need for emotional healing rather than addressing loneliness per se."
"I try so hard to keep conversations alive but...It feels impossible, I no matter who I talk to, be it someone I've known since I was a kid or someone I just randomly met playing WoW, I just can't keep a conversation flowing, I don't know, I feel like I am not interesting enough. 
It genuinely feels like a Limbo, I don't talk to anyone and I feel completely lonely, I talk to people I feel like shit for not being interesting enough. I mean, it sucks doing the exact same thing you do IRL in games - distancing myself from others during conversations and just quietly standing in place. 

Fuck, I hate being like this, sometimes I wish I wasn't a coward and would kill myself already. This world isn't a place I wanna spend years and years in, it's not worth it.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep struggle with maintaining conversations and a pervasive sense of inadequacy, both in real life and in virtual interactions. the author expresses feelings of worthlessness and frustration, highlighting a pattern of self-isolation and negative self-perception. despite these intense emotions, the narrative lacks a specific focus on the absence of meaningful connections or the typical yearning for companionship that often characterizes loneliness. instead, the emphasis is more on the individual's internal battle with self-esteem and social anxiety. while these issues can contribute to feelings of loneliness, the primary concern here appears to be the individual's self-critical nature and the impact it has on their social interactions, rather than a direct experience of loneliness itself."
Check inHow??s your day going so far?,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and brief interaction, typical of everyday social exchanges. the phrase ""how's your day going so far?"" is a common conversational starter that doesn't convey any deeper emotional undertones or signs of distress. it suggests an attempt to engage in normal social behavior rather than a cry for help or expression of loneliness. the absence of any mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or longing for deeper connection indicates that the individual is not exhibiting typical indicators of loneliness. such indicators might include expressions of feeling disconnected, unimportant, or yearning for more meaningful interactions. instead, this narrative aligns more with routine social etiquette, implying the person is likely experiencing a normal state of social engagement."
"Spent 2 hours hugging myself crying.It doesn??t really help. Life sucks. Is it too much m to ask for a person to cuddle with, hug, watch movies, and talk to all day/night long.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional distress and a yearning for human connection. the individual describes spending significant time engaging in self-soothing behaviors like hugging themselves and crying, which indicates a struggle with emotional pain. the expression of life feeling unbearable and the desire for companionship, such as cuddling, hugging, and having someone to talk to, highlights a need for intimacy and support. while these feelings and behaviors are common in people experiencing loneliness, the narrative does not necessarily confirm persistent loneliness but rather an acute moment of emotional vulnerability. such experiences can be situational and might not indicate a chronic state of loneliness, especially if the individual generally has a support system or social interactions outside of this moment."
Why do my friendships always last for 1 or 2 days before going bad?I don??t know why but every time I get a friend the first day is wonderful filled with laughs then the next day something goes bad that ends our friendship.It can be something in my life keeps me from talking to them or all of a sudden they betray me and more??Am I cursed?If I do get a friend that lasts longer they end up being toxic.At this point it??s been going on going for more then 3 years.I feel hopeless??.,0,"the narrative describes a recurring pattern of short-lived friendships and feelings of betrayal, which could initially suggest loneliness. however, the individual's ability to repeatedly form new friendships, even if they are short-lived, indicates a level of social engagement that contradicts prolonged isolation. the narrative reflects frustration and confusion over why friendships fail, but it does not convey a complete absence of social interaction or an inability to connect with others. instead, it suggests challenges in maintaining relationships, possibly due to external circumstances or interpersonal dynamics. the mention of toxic friends and a sense of hopelessness may point to underlying issues in selecting or sustaining healthy relationships, rather than an inherent state of loneliness."
No replyHow come everytime I talk to someone on messenger they look at my message but dont reply. It's soo rude,0,"the narrative expresses frustration about not receiving replies on messenger, which can be a common experience for many people and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual perceives the lack of response as rude, suggesting they have expectations for social interactions and feel slighted when these are not met. however, this reaction is more indicative of social etiquette concerns rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation. there is no mention of feeling alone, disconnected, or lacking meaningful relationships, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. the focus is primarily on the behavior of others and the immediate annoyance it causes, rather than on a sustained emotional state of feeling lonely."
"Middle of Night &amp; Awake !!Hello
Wide awake and can??t fall back asleep 
I??m open to anyone for a quick chat. 
I??m a guy.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is awake in the middle of the night and seeking someone to chat with. while this situation might initially suggest loneliness, several aspects indicate otherwise. the casual tone and openness to conversation suggest that the individual is comfortable reaching out and engaging with others. there is no mention of persistent feelings of isolation or sadness, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the person seems to be looking for a simple, temporary distraction rather than expressing a deeper sense of disconnection or emotional distress. the straightforward and upbeat manner in which the request for a chat is made implies a level of social confidence and connectivity that is not consistent with chronic loneliness."
"You don't see meI'll miss you so much good luck in Los Angeles.
????????????????????????",0,"the narrative reflects a brief message of farewell and well-wishing, which is a common and healthy expression of emotions when someone close is moving away. the writer's focus is on the other person's journey and success in los angeles, indicating a supportive and positive outlook. the mention of missing the person is natural and does not necessarily signify loneliness; rather, it shows a normal attachment and care for the individual leaving. the inclusion of numerous question marks could suggest a playful or casual tone rather than distress. overall, the message does not exhibit signs of deep isolation or emotional distress that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a moment of transition and change, handled with a balanced emotional response."
"Christmas ads are already outThey make me sad, because I know I'll never have anyone to give gifts to.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of sadness triggered by christmas ads, highlighting a lack of people to give gifts to. however, this sentiment alone does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it's important to consider that feeling sad during the holiday season can be a common emotional response for many individuals, even those who are generally well-connected socially. the narrative does not mention other key indicators of loneliness, such as a pervasive sense of isolation, a lack of meaningful relationships, or a consistent feeling of being misunderstood or disconnected from others. the focus is specifically on the holiday context, which can often amplify emotions and create temporary feelings of sadness or longing, rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"damn man, Im just sitting here 2am drinking by myself. I feel so empty man like there is no hope.:(",0,"the narrative describes a person sitting alone at 2am, drinking and expressing feelings of emptiness and hopelessness. while these expressions can be associated with loneliness, it's important to consider other psychological factors. the individual's use of ""man"" and the casual tone might suggest a temporary state of sadness or frustration rather than chronic loneliness. the time and context of drinking alone could be situational, potentially influenced by other factors such as stress or a recent event. the overall tone, while expressing negative emotions, doesn't necessarily indicate a pervasive sense of isolation that would be typical in cases of chronic loneliness."
"BattlesThe quiet is my prison. When everything is still and my head is empty, I??m rendered defenseless as a black cloud fills my mind and all I can think is why am I even here? There??s literally no point to my existence. No friends. Phone quiet and useless bc I don??t have anyone to call let alone anyone who will text me. If I??m not working, I lay in bed and fight to not go back to the blades or cry silently. Work keeps my busy. Busy keeps me from welcoming the threshold of death. I??m just ready to die",0,"the narrative describes intense feelings of isolation and hopelessness, with the author expressing a sense of purposelessness and a lack of social connections. phrases like ""the quiet is my prison"" and ""no friends"" suggest a profound sense of solitude. the mention of a ""black cloud"" filling their mind and the struggle against self-harm indicate severe emotional distress. despite the overwhelming negative emotions, the presence of work as a distraction provides a temporary escape, hinting at a small yet significant coping mechanism. overall, the narrative paints a vivid picture of an individual grappling with deep inner turmoil and a longing for connection."
"gf of two years just left me :cwe??ve been living together since january and i just got home from dropping her off at the airport 

i feel simultaneously empty and overwhelmed with emotion and don??t really have anyone i can go to

i would love someone caring and affectionate and we could try to support and heal each other a little bit",0,"the narrative describes a person who has recently experienced a breakup, which naturally involves a range of emotions such as feeling empty and overwhelmed. however, the individual does not exhibit signs of chronic loneliness. the mention of having lived together and the emotional investment in the relationship suggests a capacity for forming close bonds. while the person feels the immediate absence of their partner, the desire for someone caring and affectionate indicates an openness to new connections and a proactive approach to seeking support. this proactive attitude and the context of a recent breakup are more indicative of situational sadness rather than ongoing loneliness."
what is your opinionwhy does pain make the most basic tasks difficult ? why do we let sadness overpower us? what helps you cope with heartbreak?,0,"the narrative consists of questions about pain, sadness, and coping mechanisms for heartbreak. these inquiries reflect a curiosity about emotional experiences rather than a personal account of suffering. the absence of personal pronouns and specific details about the individual's own life suggests a more detached or analytical perspective. this detachment is not typical of someone currently experiencing loneliness, who would likely express more personal feelings or describe their own struggles. the questions seem to be seeking general understanding rather than expressing a cry for help or connection, indicating a state of curiosity rather than loneliness."
Hello i am 15(m)i am 15(m) i have never been in a relation the most contact i had with the other gender was 7 years ago it was a high five can someone please give me advise what i can do,0,"the narrative describes a young individual who is reflecting on their limited interactions with the opposite gender. while the person mentions not having been in a relationship and their most significant contact being a high five from seven years ago, the tone and content of the message do not necessarily indicate feelings of loneliness. instead, the individual is seeking advice and seems open to learning and improving their social interactions. the request for advice suggests a proactive attitude rather than one of despair or isolation. the absence of emotional language or expressions of sadness further supports the idea that this person is more curious and eager for guidance rather than feeling lonely."
I just want active ppl 2 hang with in eu[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, specifically with active people in a certain geographic region. the use of casual language and abbreviations indicates a relaxed and straightforward request rather than a plea born from deep emotional distress. the individual seems to be seeking companionship in a proactive manner, implying they have some level of social engagement and are looking to expand their social circle rather than filling a void of loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of social support, which are common indicators of loneliness. the tone is upbeat and goal-oriented, further suggesting that the person is socially motivated rather than experiencing significant loneliness."
"hang out and playHey, I built a discord to help people all ages. no one understands mentally ill better than more mentally ill! If you wanna join you can come chill and play among us! https://discord.gg/UABBdG4bvC",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and social approach to connecting with others. the author has created a discord community aimed at bringing people together, specifically those who may share similar mental health challenges. this initiative indicates a sense of purpose and a desire to foster social interaction and support. the invitation to ""chill and play among us"" suggests the author is actively seeking to engage in communal activities and has an optimistic outlook on forming connections. these aspects are typically not associated with loneliness, as they demonstrate an outward focus on building relationships and a positive engagement with others."
on the vergeon the verge of offing myself listening to the grease soundtrack on youtube. its helping,0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional struggle and mentions a severe mental health crisis. the mention of being ""on the verge of offing myself"" indicates a high level of distress and suicidal ideation. however, the act of listening to the grease soundtrack and finding some form of solace in it suggests that the individual is engaging in a coping mechanism. this behavior can be seen as a way to connect with something familiar or comforting, which may indicate that the person is not necessarily experiencing chronic loneliness but rather a temporary emotional crisis. the presence of a specific coping strategy implies that the individual has resources or methods to manage their emotional state, which is less typical in narratives dominated by loneliness where individuals often describe pervasive feelings of isolation and a lack of meaningful connections. thus, the narrative's context and the described coping mechanism suggest that the individual's distress may not be primarily rooted in loneliness."
"i sleep with a weighted blanket to make it feel like i??m being hugged, is it normal to like it?i feel weird about it",0,"the narrative describes an individual using a weighted blanket to simulate the sensation of being hugged, and they express curiosity about whether this is normal and admit to feeling weird about it. while the use of a weighted blanket can be a coping mechanism for various emotional needs, the narrative does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it reflects a common behavior where individuals seek comfort and security, which can be associated with anxiety or a desire for physical reassurance. the query about the normalcy of this behavior suggests a level of self-awareness and a desire for validation rather than a deep sense of isolation. the individual does not express feelings of being alone or disconnected from others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. rather, they seem to be engaging in a self-soothing practice and are simply questioning its typicality."
"I feel ya45 year old divorced guy here......I hope everyone on here has a positive day. Life is a grind. For me, it's been decision after decision that just hasnt worked out and left me in my mid 40's questioning the point of all this. There is a point though, even if it is us encouraging each other blindly through cyberspace. Have a good one!",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resilience and optimism despite life's challenges. the individual acknowledges the difficulties and disappointments they've faced, such as being divorced and questioning the purpose of life in their mid-40s. however, they also express hope and a positive attitude by wishing others well and recognizing the value in mutual encouragement, even if it's through cyberspace. this balance of acknowledging struggles while maintaining a hopeful outlook and finding connection, even in an online community, suggests that the person is not experiencing loneliness. their ability to reach out and express empathy towards others indicates a sense of social connection and emotional support, which are key factors in mitigating feelings of loneliness."

Do people often end up being ghosted on Reddit after a while?Or is it just me being boring?,0,"the narrative suggests a concern about social interactions on reddit, particularly about being ghosted. however, the tone and content do not strongly indicate feelings of loneliness. the author is questioning their own appeal or engagement level, which is a common social concern but not necessarily tied to loneliness. the curiosity about whether this experience is common implies a desire for understanding social norms rather than expressing isolation or emotional distress. this type of inquiry can stem from a place of self-reflection and a wish to improve social interactions rather than a deep-seated feeling of being alone. the absence of explicit mentions of feeling isolated, disconnected, or emotionally distressed further supports the idea that this narrative is more about seeking social validation and understanding rather than expressing loneliness."
Pedestrians treat me like shit because of how I look[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a perception of mistreatment by pedestrians due to the individual's appearance, which might initially seem indicative of social isolation or low self-esteem. however, the context provided does not explicitly convey feelings of loneliness. rather, it points to external factors affecting the individual's social interactions, such as discrimination or prejudice. while these experiences can contribute to loneliness, the narrative lacks direct expressions of loneliness-related emotions like sadness, longing for connection, or a sense of being unvalued in personal relationships. the focus remains on external mistreatment rather than internal feelings of solitude or disconnection, which are more typical indicators of loneliness."
Merry Christmas my lonely friends ????????????????Hope everyone??s having a good one !,0,"the narrative expresses a positive and cheerful sentiment, wishing others a merry christmas and hoping they are having a good time. the use of exclamation marks and festive greetings suggests a sense of inclusion and social connection. the mention of ""my lonely friends"" appears to be empathetic and supportive rather than indicative of the author's own loneliness. this choice of words can be seen as an attempt to reach out and connect with others who might be feeling lonely, rather than a reflection of the author's personal emotional state. overall, the tone and context of the message indicate a person who is engaged in social interaction and displays concern for others' well-being, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"i got cheated oni met a girl. she made me feel safe. she knew i had recent trauma of a girl going behind my back with another guy. she went out of her way to tell me she didn??t wanna be with anyone or kiss anyone else &amp; i didn??t have to worry about it ever multiple times. i really felt safe with her. she didn??t make me feel bad about being myself or yell at me or put me down for being weird. i still knew she??d grow disinterested like everyone else. i saw the same signs. instead of getting sad like usual though i cherished those moments extra hard because i know she could leave the next day.

"EncouragementWhatever you're going through right now, know this: You can grow through this. You can learn from this. You can build up your grit and resilience through this challenge. You're not a victim, you're an overcomer! Love your friends at r/TheFriendTreehouse (Repost from ChalupaSquirrell)",0,"the narrative exudes a sense of support and encouragement, suggesting a communal and positive outlook. phrases like ""you can grow through this"" and ""you are an overcomer"" reflect a mindset focused on personal development and resilience. the mention of ""love your friends at r/thefriendtreehouse"" implies a connection to a supportive community, indicating the presence of social bonds and a network of friends. this sense of belonging and encouragement from others are typical indicators of non-loneliness, as they highlight an individual's integration into a social group and the availability of emotional support. overall, the narrative emphasizes overcoming challenges with the help of a supportive community, which is characteristic of someone who is not experiencing loneliness."
"It's 1:15am in Australia, I can't sleep and everyone is in bed.

"I want to make new friends, but I fear that potential new friends will be scared off by the fact that I have no friends from beforeThis has been a dilemma for me. I joined a few sites to make friends on, and even though I have gotten some people to talk to me, I fear that potential new friends that I could make will be scared off that I didn??t have any friends from before, and that they don??t want to be my friend because of that, and will see me in a negative light. Anyone else feel the same?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking to form new social connections and is engaging in efforts to overcome their fears. the person has taken proactive steps by joining sites to make friends and has succeeded in initiating conversations with others. their concern about how potential new friends perceive their lack of previous friendships indicates self-awareness and a desire for social acceptance. however, the narrative does not express a sense of deep isolation or chronic loneliness. instead, it shows a person who is navigating common social anxieties and is hopeful about building new relationships. the presence of some social interactions and the proactive approach to resolving their dilemma are not typical indicators of profound loneliness."
Coworkers always talking about going outDepressing listening to this. I never go out on the weekend.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disconnection from coworkers and their social activities, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a feeling of depression when listening to coworkers talk about going out, which suggests some level of social comparison or longing. however, the absence of any direct mention of feelings of isolation, a desire for companionship, or an emotional impact beyond feeling ""depressed"" about the situation suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness. instead, the narrative may point to other factors such as introversion, personal choice, or different social preferences that do not align with those of the coworkers. the context provided does not delve into deeper emotional states or a broader sense of social disconnection that are typically associated with loneliness."
"Jealousy is killing meSo I am in love with someone I have a complicated relationship with - he lives on the other side of the country and even though we??ve known each other online for many years we??ve never met in person. Yet I feel like he??s the love of my life and that he understands me better than anyone. However, even though we??ve had our ups and downs and before I think we have finally reached rock bottom. Basically a month ago he said he wouldn??t be active for a while but couldn??t tell me why. He hasn??t been replying ever since and I??ve been extremely worried about his safety and feelings for me.

In the meantime, I feel like 16 years of sexual frustration have taken over my psyche. I am a 19-year old virgin who??s never had a guy, other than the aforementioned online FOB, interested in her. I am actually not an introvert or anything like that and always had friends in high school and actually partied quite a lot. Yet because I??m so dumb and unattractive I never got to even be seen as a romantic option by guys. I??ve been a compulsive masturbator since my preteens and have developed a lot of messed up kinks that I feel stem from the profound loneliness and a desire for an actually real experience.

Anyway this is where the title becomes relevant. I am in college, where as you probably know hook-up culture is really big and every night I hear my roomates having sex with different guys and frankly I feel really jealous. I go to clubs and sit next to my friends while guys flirt with them and treat me as though I was invisible. I am tired of this. I just want to mean something to somebody. In the end everyone I love or am interested in either leaves me or never feels the same way about me to begin with. 

I just want someone to lay down with me and tell me that they love and feel safe around me whilst cuddling me and potentially pressing their boner against my butt. I??ve said it.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is grappling with unrequited love and feelings of jealousy. they express frustration over a complicated online relationship and the absence of reciprocated romantic interest in their life. despite these emotional struggles, the individual notes that they have had a social life, friends, and have participated in parties. they also mention being active in college and engaging in social activities like clubbing. these elements suggest that the person is not entirely isolated or lacking social connections, which are critical factors in the assessment of loneliness. their issues seem more related to specific romantic and sexual frustrations rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the desire for a deeper romantic connection and the envy felt towards others' relationships are indicative of situational distress rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
Prayer and faith?Do any of you lonely hearts pray or at least keep some sort of faith that everything will work out? I constantly struggle with this because I do not want to have a sense of false hope but then again I would like to think that this is temporary and things will get better. Just curious..,0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking connection and understanding from others who might share similar experiences. they express a struggle with maintaining hope and faith, indicating an awareness of their emotional state and a desire for improvement. while there is an acknowledgment of challenges, the tone suggests a proactive approach to dealing with their situation. the curiosity about others' experiences and the consideration of faith as a coping mechanism demonstrate an openness to finding solutions and support. these elements are indicative of someone who is reflective and engaged in their emotional well-being, rather than being overwhelmed by loneliness."
just so tired of it allsometimes,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of fatigue and weariness, but it does not provide enough context or specific details that indicate loneliness. the phrase ""just so tired of it all"" could be attributed to various factors such as stress, burnout, or general dissatisfaction with certain aspects of life. without additional information about feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a desire for companionship, it is challenging to definitively link this expression of tiredness to loneliness. therefore, the narrative's brevity and lack of explicit references to social disconnection suggest it may not be indicative of loneliness."
"If you??re lonely, have some stuff to vent, or just in need of someone to talk to, DM me and I will be here for you!????????????I will talk about anything and listen to anyone in need! Don??t hesitate!",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is open and willing to provide support to others. this individual expresses a readiness to engage in conversation and listen to anyone in need, which indicates a proactive and outward-focused mindset. the tone is positive and inviting, offering assistance and companionship. such behavior is generally characteristic of someone who feels connected and capable of reaching out to help others, rather than experiencing feelings of loneliness themselves. the absence of any self-referential statements about personal struggles or isolation further supports the idea that this person is not currently feeling lonely. instead, they are positioned as a supportive figure ready to alleviate the loneliness of others."
"Make A Friend! March editionHi guys and gals, just turned March over where I am, and I remember a couple of people suggested this, so here we, here we, here we fucking go! Basically, this place will be seen as a kind of hub to make friends? I'm not entirely sure really, but with this being the first time doing it, I'm sure it will get better. I'm thinking of doing this monthly, but let me know if you think that's too often or too far apart.

Interesting fact about yourself?:",0,"the narrative exhibits an enthusiastic and proactive attitude towards social interaction, focusing on creating a community hub for making friends. the writer's tone is positive and inclusive, emphasizing respect for diverse interests and backgrounds. they also show organizational skills and a forward-thinking mindset by planning future events and considering feedback on frequency. these aspects suggest a well-adjusted individual who is socially engaged and seeks to foster connections rather than displaying signs of loneliness. the emphasis on creating a respectful and supportive environment further indicates a healthy social perspective."
"I??m the only black kid in a school of mostly racist white peopleI smoke a lot to cope with the fact that no one around really relates to me, but then I??m just high with no friends. Super annoying never fitting in and always feeling different",0,"the narrative describes an individual who feels isolated due to racial differences and uses smoking as a coping mechanism. however, the context suggests that the primary issue is more about external social dynamics and discrimination rather than an internal, pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual expresses frustration about not fitting in and feeling different, which are common reactions to being in an unwelcoming environment. while these feelings can contribute to loneliness, they are more indicative of situational distress and a struggle with external acceptance rather than a deep-seated loneliness. the narrative focuses on the external factors and coping strategies rather than an intrinsic feeling of being alone or disconnected from others on a fundamental level."

What's funny about all of this is I had a blast sober today going back and forth in a legal meeting we had over a business contract we're starting than I've had in... I can't tell you how many years.  I may be looking into law school/ becoming a paralegal because today really got my rocks off, and I don't mean sexually at all.  I think I may have finally found my calling after 27 years.  I thought it was medical, then chemist, then medical, then computers, now this.  I am a bit of a jack of all trades but today was way too fun.  Mentally exhausting but fun.  I actually impressed myself a lot going almost tit for tat w/ lawyer and having my boss kind of sit there just letting us make the decisions.   


IDK.  I'm kinda really high RN but also lonely... and my mind is just going awayyyyyyyyy 

Here's to what seem so small and insignificant but remind you of who you really are and what you're really capable of, regardless of degree, background, heartbreak, abuse, ETC  


Drop a chat, i'm bored",0,"the narrative reflects a complex mix of emotions, with the individual expressing both high moments of professional satisfaction and underlying struggles. despite the mention of feeling lonely at the end, the overall tone indicates a significant level of engagement and excitement about recent professional achievements. the person describes a day filled with stimulating activities and even considers a major career shift due to newfound interest and enjoyment. this suggests a sense of purpose and fulfillment that typically counters deep-seated loneliness. the casual mention of loneliness appears more as an afterthought rather than a dominant theme, implying that while there may be transient feelings of isolation, they are not pervasive or debilitating. the narrative's focus on positive experiences and future aspirations highlights a generally well-balanced emotional state."
"Can't seem to have funI feel like I have always struggled to enjoy myself. I have now been in college for two months and haven't made any friends, but I don't seem to care enough to try. Every time I talk to my friends from high school I realize that I don't know how to have fun. I was just asked what fun things I did this weekend, and I said studying and going to review sessions, like I sounded excited about it. To be fair, that is more than I do on a typical weekend. I have always done well in school, but I feel like I invest too much of my time into it. At the same time, I keep doing it because I have nothing else to do that really brings me joy and want to at least be good at something. I have no hobbies, and every time I am doing something that is supposed to be fun, I either stress about it or feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing. All I do is study, watch YouTube, and play the occasional game. I guess I feel satisfied most of the time, but I feel kind of empty, like I have no personality. I can never come up with a fun fact about myself, and I feel like I'm the most generic person out there. My roommate, who is a friend from high school, is the exact opposite of me. He made a friend group within a few days and seems to have so much fun all the time. I hate the fact that I am like this but I seem to be mad that he is having so much fun while I'm just doing nothing. I don't think I'm sad but I feel like I really enjoy something only once in a while just to wait for weeks or months before feeling the same happiness again.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with finding enjoyment and a sense of fulfillment, particularly in social contexts, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions a lack of interest in making new friends and seems relatively indifferent to their solitary activities, such as studying and watching youtube. despite not engaging in what is traditionally considered fun, they express a certain level of satisfaction with their routine. their comparison with a more socially active roommate and the absence of hobbies might suggest a lack of social engagement, but the person does not express a deep sense of isolation or longing for connection. rather, they seem to accept their current state and do not convey the emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the focus on academic success and the acknowledgment of occasional happiness further suggest that their primary issue lies more in finding balance and joy in activities rather than in feeling lonely."
"Worst week of the year, every yearI just wanted to start off by saying that I'm sorry if you came along to this post. I usually do my best to not share these feelings, because of how inconvenient it is to people that I've encountered in my life that I stopped trying. I just feel like for someone who shares the same week of birth as Valentine's Day, it's very rough to be alone in the world. 

My family had all of our birthdays pretty close together, mine is in Feb. My sister in March, and my mother in April, and my father in October (he's the only exception). Mine being the same week as valentine's, I always saw my parents spending all the time and money in the world getting each other gifts for valentine's that when they remembered my birthday, if they did. There would be no time for me or they'd not have anything for me. My sister mainly goes guy to guy so she's always been out socializing. Anyways, I'm not going to go on and on, but I just felt that since my family wasn't really ever around plus having no friends. I find it super depressing to share the same week of birth as valentine's, especially this year. I can only imagine what it feels like to share the same day as Valentine's. 

The worst part about it all, is that whenever I brought it up to my family, friend etc. They always made it out to me that I was being selfish. It makes me feel shitty that I, no matter what I did to win approval or merits, that I was always forgotten. Especially on the week of Valentine's, sometimes it makes me wish that I wasn't around so that I wouldn't be so much of a god**** burden. I just want to feel loved and appreciated like everyone else does. Is that too selfish?

Anyways, thank you if you made it this far. I appreciate it if you read it this far. I hope you all feel better and can be happy eventually too, if you aren't happier already.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of being overlooked and unappreciated, particularly around significant personal milestones like birthdays. the individual recounts feelings of being overshadowed by valentine's day and the attention their family members receive, leading to a sense of neglect. despite these experiences, the narrative includes a degree of self-awareness and an understanding of the impact of sharing these feelings on others. there is a clear desire for connection and validation, which is common in many people, not necessarily those experiencing loneliness. the mention of not wanting to burden others and the effort to avoid sharing these feelings indicate a level of social consideration and an attempt to manage personal emotions privately. the narrative also shows empathy towards others, hoping for their happiness, which suggests a focus on others' well-being. these aspects collectively suggest a nuanced emotional state that, while containing elements of sadness and a desire for more appreciation, does not definitively indicate chronic loneliness."
Why?[deleted],0,"the narrative appears to be very brief and lacks context or specific details, making it difficult to draw any conclusions about the emotional state of the author. the use of a single word followed by ""[deleted]"" suggests that the content was removed, which can sometimes indicate a reluctance to share personal feelings or thoughts. however, without additional information, it's challenging to identify any clear indicators of loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness might include expressions of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of sadness and emptiness. in this case, the absence of such elements and the minimal nature of the text do not provide sufficient evidence to suggest the author is experiencing loneliness."
"It hurts thinking of her after these couple of yearsBefore I left for Boot Camp, I was seeing this girl. We were together for half a year up to that point. We had a pretty stable, functional relationship. I finished Boot Camp and I was surprised to find out that she had lost feelings for me. I know it??s to be expected especially at a young age. Just thought stuff would be different...",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of loss and disappointment rather than loneliness. the individual recounts a past relationship that ended unexpectedly after returning from boot camp. the focus is on the surprise and hurt from the breakup, but there is no indication of ongoing isolation or a lack of social connections. the mention of a stable and functional relationship suggests that the person has experienced meaningful connections in the past. while the narrative does express sadness, it does not delve into feelings of persistent loneliness or social disconnection. the reflection on the breakup seems more about processing an unexpected change rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness."
"Most people today:""Dude I got laid with my girlfriend last week and it was SOOO GOOODDD THE BEST THING EVER bro I really love her everything is so awesome that is the meaning of life. Sadly I can't see her because of the quarantine when it's all over I'll go and have sex with her again for days consecutively. Omg do you even know what not having sex for a week feels like? IT'S HELLL!!!!!""

The exact same people when you mention you've never had a girlfriend:

""Don't worry bro, you don't need anyone to be happy bro, love yourself bro, sex is so overrated bro, just because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't mean you have to do so too bro, your time will come bro, you don't lose anything bro, relationships are not the meaning of life bro.""",0,"the narrative showcases a contrast between societal perceptions of romantic relationships and personal experiences. the author illustrates a scenario where people boast about their romantic and sexual experiences, emphasizing their importance and fulfillment. however, when confronted with someone who hasn't had a girlfriend, the same people offer platitudes about self-love and the overrated nature of relationships. this juxtaposition suggests a critique of societal norms rather than an expression of personal loneliness. the author does not express feelings of isolation or longing for connection but rather highlights the hypocrisy and superficiality in others' attitudes. the tone is more observational and critical, lacking the emotional depth and personal pain typically associated with loneliness."
"I wish that I could forget the painI wish i could just forget that entire year, sure there was some good times and memories but it just all reminds me of what happened. I still can??t believe it even happened i??m honestly shocked i feel like it??s a nightmare i haven??t woken up from.   I wanna forget it so that i can stop thinking up it every day, so it can stop keeping me up on nights like these. I wouldn??t even curse my worst enemy with this punishment. Can??t think of anything worse that could have happened and of course it happened it me. One part of me wants to believe i was in the wrong place at the wrong time the other wants to believe this was meant to happen.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional pain and trauma related to a specific event or period in the past. the writer expresses a strong desire to forget the painful memories and escape the ongoing distress they cause. while the narrative is filled with sorrow and regret, there is no clear indication of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the focus is primarily on the internal struggle with past events rather than a sense of being alone or disconnected from others. the writer's pain seems to stem from the traumatic experience itself rather than from a lack of social support or companionship."
"Tired of being tired of being aloneWhat I??d do for an evening hanging out with someone, talking about anything, talking shite. Just to have that chilled out comfort knowing the person you??re hanging out with is equally comfortable. God I miss that feeling. 10+yrs ago I??d laugh at the thought of such a ??want?? but jeez I want that, I need that, I miss that!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep yearning for social connection and the comfort of companionship, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the underlying tone and context indicate a sense of nostalgia rather than present distress. the individual reminisces about past experiences with fondness, suggesting that they have had fulfilling social interactions before and are capable of such connections. the use of phrases like ""god i miss that feeling"" and ""10+yrs ago i??d laugh at the thought"" implies that the desire for social interaction is rooted in positive past experiences rather than an ongoing, pervasive sense of isolation. the narrative expresses a desire for specific social interactions rather than a broader, more generalized feeling of loneliness. the distinction lies in the longing for a particular type of interaction, which is a normal human experience, rather than an all-encompassing sense of loneliness."
"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative is a detailed self-description by an individual seeking meaningful conversations and connections. while the author expresses a desire for companionship and acknowledges some personal struggles such as depression and anxiety, the tone and content reflect a proactive approach to finding someone with shared interests. the author lists a wide range of intellectual pursuits and cultural preferences, indicating a rich inner life and a capacity for deep engagement with others. the specificity of the request for audio conversations and the willingness to maintain propriety and mutual respect suggest an understanding of social dynamics and a readiness to establish a genuine connection. overall, the narrative portrays someone who, despite experiencing some challenges, is actively seeking to enrich their social interactions and build relationships based on common ground and mutual understanding."
Anyone else?Feeling different now. Short and simple. No detail,0,"the narrative suggests a brief and vague expression of a change in feelings, but it lacks the depth and specific indicators typically associated with loneliness. the phrase ""anyone else?"" might hint at seeking commonality or shared experience, yet it doesn't explicitly convey isolation or emotional distress. the brevity and lack of detail in ""feeling different now"" could indicate a neutral or ambiguous state rather than a clear sign of loneliness. without more context or emotional content, it's challenging to definitively link this narrative to feelings of loneliness. the simplicity and generality of the statement do not provide strong evidence of the psychological markers commonly seen in lonely individuals, such as explicit mentions of solitude, disconnection, or longing for social interaction."
If you were to die and could choose how then how would you like to dieHow?,0,"the narrative poses a hypothetical question about choosing the manner of one's death, which is a philosophical and existential inquiry rather than an expression of personal feelings or experiences. this type of question suggests a curiosity about life and death, but it does not inherently indicate feelings of loneliness. there are no mentions of isolation, lack of social connections, or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on a broad, impersonal topic that can engage anyone regardless of their emotional state. the absence of personal anecdotes, feelings of disconnection, or yearning for companionship supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
"Physical affection: myth or magic?I wouldn't fucking know lmao, I haven't had so much as a genuine hug or local S/O in like 4 years. One can dream, I suppose, but what's the point in doing that, right?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and sarcasm towards the topic of physical affection, yet it lacks deeper emotional cues typically associated with loneliness. the author uses humor and dismissive language, suggesting a coping mechanism rather than an expression of profound isolation. the reference to not having a genuine hug or a local significant other for several years might indicate a lack of close physical connections, but it doesn't necessarily translate to emotional loneliness. the tone remains light-hearted and resigned rather than deeply melancholic or desperate. the author's rhetorical question about the point of dreaming implies a pragmatic outlook rather than a cry for help, further distancing the narrative from the hallmarks of loneliness."
"Need someone whom I can give all my attention ????Hey Hi! I haven??t had any luck finding some friends on here but here I am trying once again. Feeling a bit lonely so yeah why not. I am an 18 year old boy and I am an engineering student. I like to draw and paint a bit and I like to play some sports. Also, I just loveee dogs so yeah I??ll instantly like you if you are into dogs too. I cannot keep the conversations going so I would really appreciate if you are good at it. So um feel free to dm me if you are interested in talkingg. Have a great dayy :)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social interaction and is open about their interests and hobbies. the person expresses a desire to connect with others and mentions specific activities they enjoy, such as drawing, painting, playing sports, and a love for dogs. while they acknowledge having some difficulty in maintaining conversations, their tone is generally positive and hopeful. they also extend an invitation for others to reach out, which suggests a proactive approach to building friendships. these aspects indicate a level of social engagement and optimism that are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative shows someone who is making efforts to overcome any feelings of isolation by reaching out and expressing their willingness to connect with like-minded individuals."
Why do I keep falling for girls I can??t have?I??m 21 and I rarely connect with girls but any girls I do talk to for an extended period of time I fall for easily. I wasted 8 years of my life on one girl I never had a chance with and now I??ve fallen for another girl who I don??t have a shot with. I don??t think I??ll ever be able to date because every girl I fall for just rejects me. It seems like dating is so easy for all my friends and my siblings but for me it??s harder than rocket science and all I want is connection with a girl but it??ll never come,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and despair over repeated romantic rejections. the individual describes a pattern of developing feelings for girls who are unattainable and laments the difficulty of dating compared to peers. despite this, the focus remains on romantic relationships rather than broader social isolation. the mention of friends and siblings suggests a network of social connections, which implies that the individual is not entirely isolated. the primary concern is unfulfilled romantic desires rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative reflects a struggle with self-esteem and romantic rejection, which are common issues but do not necessarily indicate loneliness in a broader social context."
"Musicians, let??s chatnan",0,"the narrative indicates an interest in engaging with others, specifically musicians, which suggests a proactive approach to social interaction. the use of the phrase ""let's chat"" implies a willingness and openness to connect with others, rather than a sense of isolation or withdrawal. this behavior is typically not associated with loneliness, as individuals experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of social withdrawal, reluctance to initiate contact, or expressions of feeling disconnected. the direct and inviting nature of the statement reflects a positive social outlook and a desire for communication and shared interests, which are indicators of someone who is likely feeling socially connected and engaged."
I'm just a bit lost.I've been in a new city for just over a year and I'm so disconnected from home. A fresh start now feels a bit like a total loss. I have some people here but it's not at all the same. Work here is what I wanted but now I'm not sure what to do. Someone to talk to would be nice. Really just writing this out is helpful in it's way. ,0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing feelings of being lost and disconnected after moving to a new city. despite these feelings, the person mentions having some people around, indicating a level of social interaction and support. the individual expresses uncertainty about their new situation but also finds some solace in writing about their feelings. while there are signs of adjustment difficulties, the presence of social connections and the therapeutic effect of writing suggest that the person is not experiencing deep loneliness. instead, they are navigating the normal challenges of acclimating to a new environment."
does anyone else feel so lonely that their chest start to hurt physically? its like the chest gets heavy and u can't even breathe properly..,0,"the narrative describes a physical manifestation of distress, specifically mentioning a heavy chest and difficulty breathing. these symptoms can be associated with anxiety or stress rather than loneliness. while loneliness can contribute to such feelings, the narrative does not provide enough context about social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or emotional emptiness typically associated with loneliness. the focus is more on the physical sensations rather than the emotional or social aspects that are key indicators of loneliness. therefore, the described experience may stem from other emotional or psychological conditions rather than loneliness itself."
"Should I go back to Facebook?The reasons for quitting social media are plentiful, but I sometimes lament that I have nowhere to share my worthy thoughts or memorable moments. I quit Facebook because it contributes to isolation by creating a false sense of connection. But I haven??t succeeded at becoming any less lonely. If I went back, I could only begin rebuilding with a very short friend list. Is it worth it? Would it be less lonely?",0,"the narrative reflects a thoughtful consideration of social media's impact on personal well-being rather than an expression of acute loneliness. the individual acknowledges the reasons for quitting facebook, citing the platform's tendency to foster a false sense of connection, which indicates a critical awareness of the superficial interactions it often promotes. the mention of ""worthy thoughts or memorable moments"" suggests a desire for meaningful engagement rather than a simple quest for social validation. although the person mentions not becoming less lonely after quitting, this appears more as a contemplation of social media's role in their life rather than a deep-seated feeling of isolation. the questioning tone about whether returning to facebook would alleviate loneliness further demonstrates a reflective approach rather than a desperate need for connection. this narrative shows an individual grappling with the complexities of social media and its effects, which is a nuanced consideration rather than a straightforward indicator of loneliness."
My biggest problem in life...So I find I just can't connect with girls. I just want love and I want to give it so badly. All my friends say I'm not ugly but then I get to talking to a girl and once we trade selfies I get blocked or unfollowed on snap. How am I supposed to believe my friends if this keeps happening? I'm slowly starting to lose hope...,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is struggling with self-esteem and social interactions, particularly in romantic contexts. despite the frustration and disappointment expressed, the person is actively seeking connections and has a social circle that provides reassurance. the presence of friends and the ongoing attempts to engage with others suggest that the individual is not isolated. the key issue appears to be a lack of success in romantic endeavors rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the person's hope, although waning, indicates that they are not completely detached from social support or opportunities for connection. these aspects suggest that while the individual faces challenges, they are not experiencing the deep, pervasive loneliness typically marked by an absence of meaningful social relationships."
Having trouble falling asleepSometimes I have trouble falling asleep because all the thoughts of being lonely and not having someone to talk to tend to keeo me awake until my exhaustion more dominant then the thoughts... Seems like today is one of them days...,0,"the narrative describes difficulty falling asleep due to persistent thoughts of loneliness and the absence of someone to talk to. however, the mention of these thoughts being occasional and the eventual dominance of exhaustion over these thoughts suggests that the feelings of loneliness are not pervasive or chronic. the individual recognizes the transient nature of these thoughts and their impact on sleep, indicating an awareness and ability to cope. while the narrative touches on loneliness, the context implies that it is not a constant or overwhelming experience, which is a crucial distinction in understanding the psychological state described. the reference to ""one of them days"" implies variability and an understanding that these feelings are not a permanent state, further supporting the classification."
"Lotta friendsbut not a lot of phone calls or text messages.

I hope you have a good day or night.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of social disconnection despite having a broad social network. the individual expresses feelings of sadness and frustration due to the lack of reciprocal communication from friends, leading to a sense of loneliness and bitterness. the longing for genuine, continuous interactions and the pain of seeing others engaged in happy social exchanges are prominent. these feelings are exacerbated by the repetitive and isolating daily routine described. while the person is reaching out and making efforts to connect, the lack of response from others heightens their sense of isolation. the narrative also touches on the negative emotions of jealousy and self-blame, indicating an internal struggle with these feelings. the act of venting and seeking understanding through this narrative underscores the individual's need for emotional support and connection."

Angelbluez",0,"the narrative expresses a deep yearning for companionship and healing, indicating a sense of longing and emotional pain. the writer questions their fate and whether they are destined to be alone, highlighting a struggle with feelings of isolation. despite this, the narrative also conveys a sense of hope and the belief that medicine, or perhaps a metaphorical 'medicine' in the form of a person, can heal their broken heart and soul. the plea for someone to find them suggests a desire for connection and support. while these expressions are poignant, they do not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness but rather a temporary state of distress and a hopeful outlook for resolution. the presence of hope and the belief in eventual healing differentiate this narrative from one that would typically signify deep, pervasive loneliness."
"fking pleasei want to t alk

im diyng",0,"the narrative, though expressing a strong desire for communication and connection, appears to be a momentary outburst rather than a consistent pattern indicative of loneliness. the use of informal and fragmented language suggests an immediate emotional reaction rather than a prolonged state of isolation. while the plea for interaction might seem like a sign of loneliness, it lacks the depth and context usually associated with a chronic feeling of being alone. typical indicators of loneliness often include detailed accounts of long-term social isolation, feelings of being misunderstood, and a persistent sense of emptiness. in this case, the narrative does not provide enough context or sustained evidence to suggest that the individual is experiencing loneliness on a deeper, more enduring level."

Anyway, does anyone wanna be genuine friends with good communication and emotional maturity? I would love to be friends honestly.",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and disappointment with being ghosted on social media platforms, specifically reddit. the author mentions feeling disposable and unappreciated, yet they also show a strong sense of self-worth by acknowledging that those who ghost them are the real losers. despite their negative experiences, they remain open to forming genuine friendships and emphasize the importance of good communication and emotional maturity. this resilience and the active pursuit of meaningful connections suggest that while they may face challenges in their interactions, they do not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they display self-awareness and a proactive attitude towards building relationships."
