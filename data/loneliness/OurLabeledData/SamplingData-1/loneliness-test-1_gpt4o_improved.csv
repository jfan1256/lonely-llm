I have tried to make plans but they don??t seem motivated. One of the only people I could consider a best friend also recently got into a relationship.

"Hey Im new hereI just wanted to share something, I have already talked to my friends about this but I don??t think they understand. So I was on a online relationship with a girl I met while playing xbox, We used to talk the entire time, text all the time, for me life was awesome at that point. Couple of weeks passed and she doesn??t reply like before so I think ??maybe she??s busy doing her stuff?? just gonna wait ya know. I was getting worried, all my insecurities triggered like maybe she??s with someone else or maybe she doesn??t want to talk anymore, I was thinking a lot of stuff. I was suffering those days until I decided to break up with her, couldn??t handle it. She said it was fine, that we should just be friends because she didn??t have the time to talk to me like before (due to her job and school), main reason I??m posting here is that I got used to hanging with her the entire time, now I feel very lonely and empty. Now even that we are just friends now I??m dying to be with her again and I also have desire to meet her one day.

"human connection? who is shemy best friend is someone i met online a few years back. they know everything about me and understand me so well and vice versa. i cherish them so much. i??ve never met them irl. my sister is probably the person i love most in this world, we are extremely different but love each other unconditionally and facetime every other day. she??s also long distance. i only see her a few times a year maybe. these are my two closest relationships. 

my in-person interactions are not great. i??m terrible at talking to people. im awkward and stilted and serious. i don??t know what to say. literally, nothing at all comes to mind except quick one liners of small talk where i??m not even present in the conversation. i feel like a robot. i hate it. i don??t know if it??s social anxiety or what, but i literally cannot be comfortable around people who haven??t known me for a long time. i feel like i come off as aloof and unfriendly but really i??m just awkward and uncomfortable and quiet. 

what is even the point of being a human if i can??t have genuine human connection? i feel like i??m a robot, just devoid of any personality. what is this?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and difficulty in forming meaningful connections in person, which are common indicators of loneliness. despite having a close online friend and a beloved sister, the individual expresses frustration with their inability to connect face-to-face. the descriptions of feeling awkward, stilted, and robotic during in-person interactions highlight a significant barrier to social integration. the writer's self-awareness of coming off as aloof and their yearning for genuine human connection further underscore their sense of social disconnection. the repeated questioning of their own humanity and the purpose of being a human without authentic connections suggests a profound struggle with loneliness."
"My bed feels emptyIdk why I'm feeling this way, maybe it just hit me how alone I have been the past 20 years. I hit it off with a nice girl and she spent the night and we had a great time and cuddled and it was really nice. The thing is when I sleep in my bed alone now I realize how alone I have been now and in the past. We may be a thing but she wants to take it slow.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness through several key aspects. the writer describes their bed feeling empty, which is a tangible metaphor for their emotional state. the realization of being alone for the past 20 years highlights a prolonged sense of isolation. despite having a positive experience with a new romantic interest, the writer's return to solitude intensifies their awareness of loneliness. the contrast between the joy of companionship and the starkness of being alone accentuates their feelings of loneliness. additionally, the uncertainty about the future of the new relationship, as the other person wants to take it slow, adds to their sense of vulnerability and longing for connection. these elements collectively indicate a profound experience of loneliness."
"I have been lonely my entire life yet I didn't realize it even though it was always at the back of my mind.Ignore the stupid u/ that I have. 

Since I was a kid, I always wanted to have those friends who cared for you but I never did. All I did was call people I kinda knew ""friends."" Thanks to my mom, I always knew someone but not enough that they actually cared about me. I only ever had one friend and that's the guy who I still hang out and talk to. I met another friend and now I have an overall of two friends that might maybe care if I left. During quarantine, I see people do video chats and have fun and talk with people but I haven't done that, only when I needed for my class. I should probably post this in my alt account but I gave up. My mom has always tried and I've tried to talk to her but she refuses so I guess she doesn't try. She may be trying to try but I guess she fails. My girlfriend, the only thing I basically have to live for, has stuff to do so we don't talk much. Even the people who I think MIGHT care about me don't even send me so much as a ""hi"" once a month. This whole quarantine, I've only talked to 5 people in dms and the rest don't even try. I hate ranting but I just needed to send this. I've never had anyone to share my shitty life with. I don't think I may have someone else apart from my girlfriend and even then, I don't want to burden her or spam her while she does more important stuff. I hate my irresponsible, sad, hateful, life but I don't want to die just yet. I just have to hold on to the fact that darkness is pure shit compared to this. At least I have Reddit to keep me at least going somewhat kinda.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and longing for meaningful connections. the individual recounts a lifelong struggle with loneliness, marked by a lack of close friendships and meaningful interactions. they express a deep desire for friends who genuinely care, but their experiences have been limited to superficial relationships. the mention of quarantine exacerbates their feelings of isolation, as they observe others engaging in social activities while they remain disconnected. their relationship with their mother appears strained, adding to their sense of being unsupported. the reliance on their girlfriend as a primary source of emotional support, despite infrequent communication, underscores their limited social network. the narrative also reflects a sense of resignation and hopelessness, as they express feelings of burdening others and a general dissatisfaction with life. these elements collectively illustrate the classic indicators of loneliness, such as social isolation, lack of meaningful relationships, and a pervasive sense of disconnection from others."
"Does anyone still feel lonely even around family?Even though I'm living with my grandma, my mom and brother I still feel lonely I guess because I haven't seen my friends yet it's been a year...",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness despite the presence of family members, which is a common indicator of emotional isolation. the individual mentions living with close relatives such as their grandma, mom, and brother, yet they still experience feelings of loneliness. this suggests that physical proximity to others does not necessarily fulfill their emotional or social needs. the mention of not having seen friends for a year further highlights the lack of meaningful social connections outside the family unit, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the yearning for friends and the extended period without social interaction are significant indicators that contribute to their sense of isolation. this aligns with psychological insights that emphasize the importance of diverse social networks and the role of peer relationships in emotional well-being. overall, the narrative clearly demonstrates key aspects of loneliness, such as emotional disconnection and the impact of prolonged social deprivation."
"Needed a place to ventI quit my job of two years not too long ago. It was a liquor store. Young crowd, a lot of fun. I was a hard worker and had a solid sense of humor so I thought I fitted in well there. 
 
I was good at the job, and was moving up. By far the owner??s favorite employee. 

I??m also an alcoholic who??s been diagnosed with clinical depression for some time. After a failed suicide attempt I knew I had to get back on my combination of anti-depressants. If any of you know much about those meds, you under NO circumstances can drink with them. 

So I quit, for the betterment of my mental health. I haven??t received ONE text message from the people I considered my closest friend group. The people I spent 40 hours a week for two years around. And it hurts, damnit it hurts like a mutha. 

I??m moved back in with my Dad, and I??m in between jobs. I could go work at McDonald??s, or a private security company, but I??d rather not go back to a minimum wage job. I??ve been applying left and right but I guess two years of booze slinging isn??t a selling point to employers.

  God damnit I??m lonely. God damnit man. If you made it this far thanks for reading. *fist bump*",1,"the narrative presents multiple indicators of loneliness. the author describes a significant life change, quitting a job where they felt a sense of belonging and camaraderie. despite their hard work and good relationships at the liquor store, they have not received any communication from their former colleagues, which intensifies their feelings of isolation. the author also mentions moving back in with their dad and being between jobs, adding to the sense of instability and disconnection. the emotional weight of their words, particularly phrases like ""it hurts like a mutha"" and ""god damnit i’m lonely,"" explicitly convey their profound sense of loneliness and pain. the combination of losing a support network, struggling with mental health issues, and facing uncertainty about the future are all strong indicators of loneliness."
"I'm 23, finished my uni and yet I don't have a single friend. How do you deal with this? All those years and not a single person is interested in knowing if I'm alive or dead. It's gonna keep getting worse as I grow older. I don't have the energy to go out and start conversations either.Maybe I am the problem?",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a lack of social connections despite having completed university, a time when many people form lasting friendships. the statement ""i do not have a single friend"" underscores the absence of social bonds. the rhetorical question ""how do you deal with this?"" suggests a sense of helplessness and a search for coping mechanisms. the phrase ""not a single person is interested in knowing if i am alive or dead"" conveys feelings of invisibility and insignificance, common in loneliness. the anticipation that it ""is gonna keep getting worse as i grow older"" indicates a fear of prolonged isolation. the lack of energy to initiate conversations further highlights social withdrawal, a typical response to chronic loneliness. finally, questioning whether they are ""the problem"" suggests self-blame and low self-esteem, often associated with loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant loneliness."
"Turned 30 years old a few months ago, only had one real relationship and it was so long ago.Doesn't help either that it was an abusive relationship and that she ended up committing suicide. Turned me into a wreck of a man for years.

I don't know what to do. I've never had anyone else since and I feel like I'll stay lonely 'til the end of my life. It hurts. I'm tired of coming back home and seeing an empty, dark and lonely place. 

Don't have any real friend either. I work, I get depressed because my work sucks and because I have a probably non-reciprocal love on a coworker and when I come back home I'm alone. All I can do to cope is drink.

Sometimes I go out alone, especially at night, in the juvenile hope that I'll somehow meet the love of my life outside but obviously I never did and never will.

I don't get what's wrong with me. I'm not that bad of a person. At least I think so.",1,"the narrative reflects deep emotional pain and isolation. the author mentions a traumatic past relationship that ended tragically, leaving long-lasting scars. the sense of hopelessness and the belief that they will remain lonely for the rest of their life are strong indicators of loneliness. the description of their home as an ""empty, dark and lonely place"" further emphasizes their isolation. the lack of real friends and unreciprocated feelings for a coworker contribute to their sense of being unloved and unwanted. their coping mechanisms, such as drinking and going out alone at night with the hope of meeting someone, underscore their desperation for connection. the self-doubt and confusion about why they are alone, despite believing they are not a bad person, highlight their struggle with self-worth and loneliness."
"I have never been able to make friends. I have no one to talk to and I can't take it anymore.It may sound like I'm rambling, but please bear with me as I just need someone to talk to, and English is not my first language.

I'm 24 years old. In my childhood I was a prodigy. Marvelous in studies, topped my school for 12 grades in a row. But since my childhood I was never raised to be an outgoing, social person. So my social skills are extremely low. I have only my parents with whom I can share my feelings.

Due to my bad social skills, I have been bullied, mocked mercilessly by almost every one. I have never been able to make even a single friend. Every single time I fall for someone thinking of them as my friend, turns out they were just exploiting me and making fun of me behind my back. God knows how many times I've cried my eyes out to my parents regarding this, but they just come to their wit's end and just pray to God and cry along with me.

I somehow managed to get into a good college. But unfortunately I live in an overpopulated country with low infrastructure for career offers and paths. So the major factor deciding your career success is having excellent social skills and vast network so you can gather as much info as possible. I don't so I remained jobless for an year, while other students with very less marks than me managed to get into top companies.

Now I got into a small company and into a team which seamed nice at first. But I was apprehensive about opening up to them, due to my past experiences. They remained friendly to me, cracked jokes with me, called me to have lunch with them, and slowly my apprehension started lowering. I got hope that finally I was able to make friends. I'm not lie, I happy cried along with my parents about this.

On 2nd November was my birthday, so I gathered up enough courage to ask them to visit a popular place with me. Throughout that day, all of them were having fun amongst themselves, clicking pictures, etc while I felt like an outsider. I spent a TREMENDOUS amount of money at a popular restaurant all by myself as an effort for them to like me, maybe consider me as one of them.

What I found out next broke my heart into pieces. While I was under the assumption that we were all leaving for our homes after that outing, all of them were only pretending to leave for their homes. Instead they waited for me to leave, and after that went to a second place just for themselves to enjoy, and made fun of me the entire time. Moreover, all this time, they had a team whatsapp group that i didn't know about, mocking me about the things I opened up to them about, and they had been visiting various places and restaurants and whatever for the past few months, and I was the only one who didn't know about it.

One of those people's birthday is next week, and I suggested to visit this great amusement park. She said she'll be out of town that day, but I just found out that she was just lying to me, and is secretly planning a big party with all other team members. Even a person who left the team over a few months ago is invited, but not me 

I have been sitting in a separate room in the office for the past hour, crying like a baby. What did I do wrong? Why is God so cruel to me? I opened my heart to these people and this is the result. Memories of my whole past life that I have been trying hard to bury are flashing before my eyes.

I feel like a defective product coming from the factory being pushed into this world. I was not made to be in this society. But at my core, I am a human being too, and humans are social animals. When my parents die, I'll have ABSOLUTELY no one. All my life, whenever I have felt strongly about suicide, the thought of my parents immense sadness stops me. But guys, I can't take it anymore!

Anyone who reads this whole post, I sincerely thank you for taking time out of your life for a useless fool like me. I'm open to all suggestions. For now I just hope I can get through this day.",1,"the narrative reveals deep feelings of isolation and despair. the author describes a lifelong struggle with social interactions, starting from childhood. despite academic success, the individual was never encouraged to develop social skills, leading to a lack of friendships and repeated experiences of bullying and mockery. this history of negative social experiences has fostered a sense of distrust and hopelessness. recent events at work, where colleagues pretended to be friendly but secretly excluded and ridiculed the author, have exacerbated these feelings. the author expresses a profound sense of betrayal and loneliness, feeling like an outsider even in seemingly social situations. the recurring theme of being unable to form genuine connections and the intense emotional pain described are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual's reliance on parents for emotional support and the fear of complete isolation after their passing further highlight the depth of their loneliness. the narrative concludes with a cry for help, underscoring the severity of the author's emotional state and their urgent need for support and understanding."
"Lonely on my Birthday as alwaysMy birthday is on the 1. January and I'm afraid I will be lonely as always.
I am afraid of it, because I will probably act happy and amused but inside I'm lonely. I will probably get messages from people that never cared about me wishing me happy birthday. I don't have anyone to talk about. I thought  I'm getting better. But now at the end of the year Depression, Boredom, Loneliness is striking back. Harder then before. I always try to be positive, or at least give the appearance. 
I thought about just flying away. Buying a plane ticket and just flee from all of this. But this won't solve it. I'm to young. It breaks me. Piece by piece. I just thought about suicide. It seems easy, yet so hard. I can't anymore. Loneliness is ripping me apart. I don't know what to do. There is no escape. 
I'm suffering.",1,"the narrative reflects deep emotional distress and a profound sense of isolation. the writer expresses fear and anticipation of being lonely on their birthday, a day that typically signifies celebration and connection. the mention of receiving insincere messages from people who do not genuinely care highlights a lack of meaningful relationships. the writer's feelings of depression, boredom, and loneliness intensifying towards the end of the year are indicative of seasonal affective disorder or a similar cyclical pattern of emotional turmoil. the contemplation of fleeing or even suicide underscores the severity of their loneliness and hopelessness. the struggle to maintain a facade of positivity while feeling internally broken is a common coping mechanism for those experiencing loneliness. the narrative's recurring theme of inescapable suffering and the sense of being torn apart piece by piece are poignant indicators of the writer's acute loneliness and emotional pain."
"Caught up in my head...I started smoking weed a couple weeks ago to give me something to do instead of mope, and it worked for a bit; it makes me all smiley and flowy. But I tonight I was smoking outside by myself leaning on the wall, and I got all caught up in my head... I closed my eyes, and imagined that I had a guy next to me all cuddled up into my side with his head nestled into my shoulder... shit felt so real that I leaned into it and fell on the floor lmao. I tried to do it again but couldn't replicate the feeling... it fell like fucking bliss man, I'd do anything to feel that way again, to feel loved, to feel like someone actually wants me by their side; even if it's fake and even if it's just for a few seconds...",1,"the narrative reveals deep-seated feelings of loneliness through several key aspects. the individual's use of weed as a coping mechanism to distract from moping indicates an attempt to escape from negative emotions. the vivid daydream of having someone cuddled up next to them, and the subsequent longing to replicate that feeling, underscores a profound desire for companionship and physical affection. the narrative's emphasis on the blissful sensation of feeling loved and wanted, even if it was imaginary and fleeting, highlights a significant emotional void in the person's life. these elements collectively point to a struggle with loneliness, as the person yearns for genuine connection and the warmth of human presence."
"I've (17 M) been feeling lonely and I really hate itI'm sorry if this is going to be long or not. I've always had a bad habit of drifting away of one topic to another one and so one. So I will try my best to stay on one topic. This will be a brief history of me to give you an idea of why I'm like this I guess.

I'm a 17 year old and I've been feeling lonely for some time. Unemployed, dropped out, and mentally unstable. I've had people I talked to in the past though. But only had one that I really considered a friend. I've had a really rough childhood. Alcoholic dad and slightly abusive mom. Never really got along with other kids considering I was fat. I developed insecurities at a really young age. I had a bit of hair on my legs at 3rd grade while others didn't. I had a deep voice at a young age too. Acne came early. I was depressed and anxious of what people thought. I had things other kids didn't have at that age. So obviously I was mostly lonely all throughout elementary. Bullied mentally and physically (never told anyone about the physical part) but you know I did my best to ignore. I managed. (Note: my dad went to jail when I was around 10 and my mom was a single mom working her ass off to provide for our family of 5 including me for years. Became less abusive. My 3 oldest brothers also moved out so it was just me, my sister, and my mom.)

Then (7th grade) middle school rolled in and obviously it got worse. I was skinnier though but kids still point out something to bully about me. I've already had insecurities to start with so I just wanted to run away from school to somewhere. Not home. Just somewhere away from everyone to cry and hit myself for being like this. But I couldn't. Didn't want to make it obvious that I was affected by them. So I did what I always have been doing and ignored. About fall in 7th I noticed facial hair. I didn't care though. I actually liked it lol. But around winter I noticed something off about my back. It was curved. I had scoliosis. Never really noticed. Didn't pay attention to sitting up straight. I hated it. I tried having good posture but it hurt to sit up straight (note. My scoliosis is worse). But I just gave up and continued with it I guess. January. I had a really bad bully. He was in most of my classes too. Embarrassed me in front of my crush. Gave me a really hard time. Harassed me. Made me lose my confidence even more. Whenever I had a good haircut or new clothes he always had something to say. But I still managed throughout the rest of 7th. I still managed.

Then 8th grade oh God. It was rough. Already fucking bullied straight off the bat. Scoliosis. Acne. Deep voice. Greasy face. Just everything at one hit me the first week of school. I couldn't handle it anymore. I just wanted to have someone to understand my situation. I fucking hated myself even more. I went home from school on Friday and cried in the bathroom (note. We had a 2 bedroom apartment so I shared a room with my mom while my brother shared one with our sister.). I came out after an hour and grabbed a knife and well... Started cutting my wrists and face. It hurt a lot but after sometime it took the pain away. Distracted me. I DON'T EVER CONDONE IT. Please don't EVER hurt yourself (Below I will provide a suicide hotline). And on Monday I went to school and people saw. Said it was a new cat problem. Can't believe they believed me. Either that or they just wanted a way to just not talk about it anymore. After that I stopped going. My whole mental health state just was at a all time low. Depression consumed me. Anxiety too. PTSD. A lot of things. Hurting myself even more. I went to a state mental hospital. didn't helped. And it was just a cycle. Started online dating at 14 because I had no luck in person and honestly... It was great. Although it wasn't physical I was happy for a moment. Sure they didn't see me in person but I showed them how I look and they still loved me. I gained confidence. Sending selfies, talking over the phone, video calling. They helped. But depression can really kill a person's mind and it got the best of me. You see I don't like telling people this but I'm bipolar. I have more depressive than manic. It was during my depressive moment. I just lost confidence. Thought she was gonna leave me and I started hurting myself again. Worse than before. Couldn't control it. Went back to the hospital for 2 weeks instead of a normal week stay. Still didn't help. As time went on she did break up with me. I regret what I said though. I said if she breaks up with me I'll kill myself. I was stupid. But obviously I didn't. And time passed by fast. I was unstable but I managed.

Turned 15. Still dropped out. Was more mentally stable due to medication. Realized my past actions and I started to kinda.... Help my mental state? I started finding coping skills. I had online friends I text a lot. Played games with. Fortnite, Black ops 2, etc. I went 6 months without hurting myself. Was proud. My mom was proud. Still depressed here and there with a bit of anxiety but medication helped. Then I stopped taking medication. Realized how lonely I was. And stopped. I don't know why. I thought that I didn't need them anymore. And for a time yeah I didn't. I didn't want to rely on a pill. And I helped myself become happier without them. But like I said my mom was a single mother. We were well.. homeless. For a time. My mom had friends though. Friends that provided a place to stay. A place as in one room. All of us in one room. I hated my mom's friend. He was immature and just overall mean. Mean as his actions. He had roomates. 3 bedroom apartment. 2 were taken by his roommates. It was during winter too. So when we would sleep in the room he would sleep in the car. Though I felt bad I was grateful. Still hated him though. Then he got tired of sleeping in the car. Understandable but he told us that we have to sleep in the car. So we did. One word: cold. I had a thick blanket but damn. Shivering all night. Couldn't sleep. we would put a blanket to cover the front car window because security would drive around. One time we got caught. And he went back to his apartment and he didn't open the door and we would just stay in the kitchen all night. Got depressed. But at times when my mom had enough money we would get a room at a hotel for a night. IT. WAS. THE. BEST. Warm, free WiFi, AND A SHOWER!!! I loved it. I would play fortnite with my online friend all night and I had a blast. My mom's friends room didn't have wifi. So we would walk to the library everyday and stay there for hours. (Note: didn't get wifi till recently lol) And my mom had another friend who would drive us to the hotel and back. One day my mom's friend told us we couldn't stay anymore I think. So my mom's friend who would drive us to the hotel got us a place to stay for a while. Again. A room. A strangers house. But warm. Grateful. No wifi though. Although it was a rough 6+ months we managed.

After some time we stayed at my mom's friend apartment (the one who gave us a ride). AND AGAIN A ROOM. But still was grateful. It was good. Wifi. Food. We were happy.  Had a girlfriend online. I was happy. And after some time we got kicked out (my mom's friend was renting the place though and the owner said that we gotta move out. Even my mom's friend.). LUCKILY he got a apartment. No room. Just an apartment for us 5. It's warm here. I like it. Wifi too. Lost my PS4 though cause when we would sleep in the car I kept my PS4 in the trunk but it got towed. Oh well I play on pc though. Low end PC but I got good games. But I still felt lonely. No friends. I'm bipolar and my online friends didn't like my depressive moments. I only have 1 online friend but I feel like I bother them. Had a breakup a few months back so a lot of people I text online stopped talking to me. Haven't been on social media in weeks. Nobody really texts me anymore. I find myself just playing videogames all day. And at night just YouTube. Quiet. I like to call myself a talkative introvert. Meaning that I hate socializing but I love talking lol. I feel uncomfortable socializing outside of home. I stutter, sweat, etc. Currently have non existent finger nails since I'm a nail biter when I'm nervous LOL. But yeah. I feel lonely. I've applied for 4 jobs but didn't get it. Applying for another one as of right now though. Still trying. I still have insecurities. Still have scoliosis. No acne though. Deep voice but I've grown into it. I have a gap between my two front teeth though. And I hate it. But with corona the masks covers it LOL. Although being lonely has its moments. When I get a haircut there's no one to criticize me. So I feel good. New clothes are the best too. Although I'm fat again I've been exercising a bit to get back in shape. But most of the time I just find myself doing the same thing over and over again. I sleep in the living room alone so it gets lonely. Really lonely. Although it's rough now I'm trying to help myself be better again. Applying for jobs, going outside more, etc. I'm 4 months clean from hurting myself too. So I'm happy about that. But I'm scared that depression will consume me again. Scared to be in my 20's, 30's, etc alone. No friends. No partner. I do pray to have a family though and a wife who will love me greatly. But who knows? I'm not rushing things now. They say having kids is a pain but hey I don't mind lol. Hate being lonely 80% of the time.

I'm sorry if this is long to read but I've never really told anyone my past in one take. Never really told anyone at all. If you've read everything thank you. It's nice to know someone's interested in my life &lt;3

P.S. I typed this after my mental breakdown lol. I didn't know where I wanted to go with this post but I just wanted to get everything out since I bottled up almost everything in my life. Thank you for reading :)

[National Suicide Prevention Hotline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain that has been a constant in the author's life. the author describes a series of adverse experiences, including a troubled childhood with an alcoholic father and an abusive mother, which likely contributed to their feelings of loneliness and insecurity. the bullying at school, both mental and physical, exacerbated these feelings, leading to depression, anxiety, and self-harm. despite occasional moments of connection, such as online dating and friendships, these were fleeting and often overshadowed by their mental health struggles. the author's transient living situation, including periods of homelessness, further isolated them from stable social connections. their description of feeling lonely even when surrounded by family or friends highlights the depth of their emotional solitude. the narrative also mentions a fear of future loneliness, indicating a persistent and pervasive sense of isolation. overall, the author's recounting of their life is marked by numerous indicators of loneliness, including social withdrawal, self-harm, and a lack of meaningful, sustained relationships."

"Since I moved out I feel so lonely.So I moved out about 4 months ago with my gf. I feel like I am falling down a jealous pit of loneliness. Before I would just talk to her all the time but because of recent work schedules  we haven??t seem each other much. So my main source of socialization has gone. 

I have always been stuck to one or two really close friends for as long as I remember, but when we drop out of favor it always is devastating to me. I never seem to have a back up friend or a diverse pool of people to rely upon when I need it. 

Has any else ever experienced this and have any tips for getting out of this circle?",1,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of loneliness characterized by several key aspects. the individual expresses a feeling of isolation since moving out, compounded by a significant reduction in social interaction with their girlfriend due to conflicting work schedules. this loss of a primary source of socialization is a common indicator of loneliness. the person's reliance on a very small social circle, and the devastation they feel when those relationships falter, further highlights their vulnerability to loneliness. the absence of a broader social network or ""backup friends"" exacerbates their sense of isolation. the narrative also conveys a plea for advice, indicating a desire to break free from this cycle of loneliness, which underscores their awareness of and struggle with their current emotional state. these elements collectively illustrate the typical markers of loneliness."
"Not the best kind of friend to have.I used a lot of different subreddits to meet people. A lot of people came to talk to me and I thought I had made a lot of friends. But I'm not the greatest at conversation, so most of the people that wanted to talk to me just kind of...ghosted me. I'm not the greatest at talking. I have a hard time talking with other guys and when I talk to girls, I'm so socially deprived I end up catching feelings whem they're just trying to be nice to me. It's pretty gross, I know. I just don't really know what to do.",1,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of loneliness through the individual's repeated failed attempts at forming meaningful connections. the use of multiple subreddits to meet people indicates a proactive yet desperate effort to find companionship, which often is a hallmark of loneliness. the individual's self-awareness about their conversational shortcomings and the resulting ghosting by others further exacerbates their feelings of isolation. their struggle with social interactions, particularly with the opposite sex, and the subsequent inappropriate emotional attachments suggest a deep-seated need for connection and validation. this combination of social difficulties, self-deprecation, and the longing for meaningful relationships are clear indicators of loneliness."
"I feel like I'll never actually have friends because I'm a boring loserI used to like, sort of talk to people, back when I had to leave the house for school. Now.. I haven't had any friends in a year. Almost all my social interaction is arguing with my parents, or arguing with strangers online about video games. 

The thing is, I COULD try talking to people online, but that never works. I hate my voice, I hate smalltalk, I hate trying to make something work when the person I'm talking to is so blatantly shallow and boring. I find it really hard to relate to people, because I've never really had friends or any sort of interesting life experiences to talk about. I've tried making friends online before, none of them ever want to talk to me. So I stop talking to them.. and then I'm back to square one.

I hate TRYING to make friends. But I hate not having friends even more. I don't know what to do. So I just usually sit in my room and try not to cry lol. 

I don't want to hear any ""I'll be your friend"" I just want to know if anyone can relate to me",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a struggle with forming and maintaining social connections. the individual expresses feelings of being a ""boring loser"" and recounts a significant shift from having some social interactions during school to now having almost none. the majority of their current interactions are negative, involving arguments with parents or strangers online. they also describe a consistent pattern of failed attempts to make friends, both online and offline, leading to feelings of frustration and resignation. the person's self-perception is notably negative, as they express hatred for their own voice and disdain for small talk, which exacerbates their difficulties in connecting with others. the narrative conveys a cycle of attempting to reach out, facing rejection or disinterest, and retreating back into isolation, which is a common experience among those feeling lonely. the individual's plea for understanding, rather than superficial offers of friendship, highlights a desire for genuine connection and empathy, further underscoring their sense of loneliness."
"Been feeling extra lonely as of late and haunted by memories ???? could use some distractions.Covid aside, this year has been an absolute crapfest and I've come to the realisation that very few people genuinely care; like truly and unconditionally and from the heart in the way that your supposed friends and family should.  

I can't help but feel like a burden to them all or that maybe they don't understand me. 

Been straggling with insomnia and anxiety so much more lately too ????",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. the author explicitly mentions feeling extra lonely and haunted by memories, indicating a preoccupation with past events that might exacerbate their sense of solitude. the realization that very few people genuinely care, especially those who are supposed to be close like friends and family, underscores a feeling of emotional disconnection and lack of support. the mention of feeling like a burden suggests a low self-worth and an internalized belief that they are not valued by others. additionally, the struggle with insomnia and anxiety can be both a cause and a symptom of loneliness, as these conditions often accompany prolonged periods of social isolation and emotional distress. the desire for distractions points to an attempt to escape these overwhelming feelings, further highlighting their struggle with loneliness."
"I'm stuckI switched to another school this year. And i cant find any friends here, because we don't have anything in common. Im totally different, i have another interests and views on life. Im silent most of the time, and i only answer if someone asks me. I've had some good friends in my old school but we are separated now. I just spend my whole day in school with phone, because i dont know what to talk about. And i can't find any friends out of school because i live in a small town (1300 people) and i can't find any communities here, nothing happens here at all.  Sometimes i don't even go to school because its boring and sad. I cant study because of it, loneliness kills me.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects the individual's struggle with loneliness. they describe a sense of isolation after switching schools and mention the difficulty in finding friends due to differing interests and views. the person feels disconnected and spends most of their time on their phone, indicating a lack of social interaction. the mention of having had good friends at their old school but being separated now adds to their sense of loss and loneliness. the small town setting with limited opportunities for social engagement further exacerbates their feelings of isolation. their reluctance to attend school due to boredom and sadness, coupled with the statement ""loneliness kills me,"" strongly suggests a deep sense of loneliness and despair. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, highlighting the emotional and social challenges the individual is facing."

"Anyone else extremely active on Reddit to make themselves feel less lonely?I post a shit ton here, and I do it because I have no one else to talk to about how frustrated and pained I am by everything",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness as the individual expresses a need to be extremely active on reddit to mitigate their sense of isolation. the mention of having ""no one else to talk to"" about their frustrations and pain highlights a lack of social support and meaningful connections in their life. this reliance on online interactions as a substitute for real-life relationships is a common indicator of loneliness. the intensity of their engagement on the platform, described as posting ""a shit ton,"" further underscores their attempt to fill an emotional void. psychological insights suggest that people experiencing loneliness often seek out virtual communities to find some semblance of companionship and validation, which is evident in this narrative."
"4 years of unsuccessful attempt of trying to make friendsWell in real life I have always had friends who have been with me those are mostly the people I met in school or college they're all nice people and would have great time with them which is rare .
But somehow I don't know why I always feel alone like I have something missing inside me . Like I need someone with me online to text and talk to me online daily . That feeling of loneliness was always there . 
So year one I was on instagram I met this girl named called Nina we become really good friends we shared feelings had a good time . She was  there everyday we'd talk have nice time everyday I started distance relationship with her not knowing what I was getting into we dated hard for like year and a half then I eventually discovered she was cheating on me with someone first time she apologized and told me it was nothing she messed up asked me to stay so I did because I did loved her but it didn't work she cheated on me again few months in her friend told me she was sleeping with someone so I left her and hated myself for being an idiot and for believing that something like that would have worked . 
After that time I was ofcourse depressed and didn't wanted relationship because I felt betrayed and used . 
But me feeling alone and stress from real life pushed me look out someone this was the time I met many horrible people who just wanted to sext or needed something weird .
But finally after months of bullshit I met this lesbian girl amy . 
Amy is the best person I met online she was super nice and caring , she helped me with my stress she was there for me always . I never tried be more then more then a friend because she was gay and I respected that so I never tried I liked her as my best friend and I loved I had a such an amazing friend who was there for me .
We watched movies and shows with eachother we even had a list of things we'll watch and do together . 
But somethings changed and part of it was me too . Maybe I became to much for her to handle but I don't know why I did to her I support her alot when she felt alone missed her ex or was stressed about her life I was there for her. We started getting in fights we started having problems with eachother opinions on dumb things . 
She was being bossy all the time thought she was always correct and she hated when I told her that but it was true . I was pain in her ass too
Then I started noticing and she was avoiding me I asked her several times like let me fix things but she always said she is busy then she joined some discord groups where she made friends and it made me feel little lonely and I started acting jealous because she didn't talk to be in days even when I tried so hard . 
I was always nice to her but I needed things to be clear but whenever I tried she hated it she thought I was attacking her 
One day I tried to sort things out she just blocked me . More then year of friendship just gone and it didn't affect her at all I guess because I tried to reach her but she told me to stop . 

And I am alone again.... 
What did I need? Just a friend that's it .. but it just doesn't happen 
I always feel lonely now . I wish to get my friend back everyday I cry about it but I am lonely again . 4 Years and I'm still at zero . 
And im scared if anyone is gonna read it or does someone even give a shit about me I don't know . 
Would love a friend right now . Hit me up if you need a friend I'm here.",1,"the narrative presents a profound sense of isolation and unfulfilled social needs despite attempts to form connections. the author describes a persistent feeling of emptiness and a desire for daily communication, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the relationships mentioned, both with nina and amy, initially provided some relief but ultimately ended in betrayal and further isolation. the author's reaction to these endings, including depression and self-blame, underscores a deep emotional impact. the recurrent theme of seeking companionship, only to face disappointment and rejection, amplifies the sense of loneliness. the narrative's concluding plea for friendship and acknowledgment of ongoing loneliness further solidifies the pervasive feeling of being alone and disconnected."
"Everything sucks when you're extroverted.I crave talking to people. But many issues have to fuck that up. Quarantine is the main one. Aside from that, I have no one to talk to at any point ever. I just want someone to hug and love. All I do with my life at this point is scroll through Reddit and have mental breakdowns and I'm genuinely sick of everything. Nothing seems to matter at this point",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness, starting with the author's explicit statement about craving social interaction and the lack of people to talk to. the frustration with quarantine highlights an external factor exacerbating their isolation, while the absence of meaningful connections is evident in their longing for physical affection and emotional support. the repetitive behavior of scrolling through reddit and experiencing mental breakdowns underscores a sense of despair and purposelessness. these elements collectively point to the deep emotional distress and social disconnection typical of loneliness."
"i??m so lonely that i??m beginning to think no one would care if i died or disappearedi have no friends. the only people who would miss me are my mom and dad and that??s the only reason i??m still alive tbh. this post isn??t even asking for advice or anything just writing some of my thoughts out. reddit is kind of like a journal to me maybe? or maybe i??m just so extremely lonely and pathetic that i??m talking to myself on the internet. i sleep all day, i try to sleep in for as long as i can until i really just have to get up. i have all online classes and i only work 2 days a week but my job is a 1 person job so i don??t socialize there either. can anyone relate? maybe i would just love to talk to someone anonymously about life, no age/gender/ or anything like that. just human to human where we are able to vent anytime",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and despair, evident through the author's explicit statements about feeling that no one would care if they died or disappeared. the lack of social connections is emphasized by the mention of having no friends and only finding solace in the thought that their parents would miss them. the use of reddit as a journal highlights their need to express thoughts and feelings, suggesting a lack of available, supportive relationships in their offline life. their sleep patterns and limited social interaction due to online classes and solitary work further illustrate a life devoid of meaningful human contact. the plea for anonymous conversation underscores a deep yearning for connection and understanding, typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative paints a vivid picture of an individual struggling with feelings of worthlessness and seeking any form of human connection to alleviate their emotional pain."
"Say something meaninglessMaybe loneliness makes someone grow up, but it is really painful.As a student,i have no friends to talk to in the school.it is too terrible when you ask a question in your dormitory but nobody answers.And teachers don't know your name and never ask you to answer questions in the class.When i am at home,just silence.Parents haven't divorsed just because of you,but they never talk.i had tried to say something inside my heart to them,but what gain is misunderstanding.Well,I'd better shut up.




",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional pain. the author describes their school experience as devoid of meaningful social interactions, highlighting the absence of friends and the lack of engagement from teachers. the dormitory scene, where questions go unanswered, underscores the feeling of being invisible and unheard. at home, the silence is palpable, with parents who stay together not out of love but obligation, further emphasizing the emotional disconnect. attempts to communicate feelings result in misunderstanding, leading to the decision to remain silent. these elements collectively illustrate the deep loneliness the individual experiences, as they navigate through life feeling unnoticed and misunderstood."
"I miss soft conversations in bedIn the past I've dealt with some pretty intense pangs of loneliness, and in many ways have learned to enjoy life in spite of them. I've been in one relationship, and the thing I miss the most about it are the memories of laying in bed, just talking about things. We weren't compatible enough to be in a relationship forever, but those moments were the closest I've been to feeling romantically fulfilled.

It's almost funny, in a depressing sort of way, how our lives and dating rituals are so complex but our desires are *so simple*. I just want a close, intimate connection with a person. That's it. And yet I've spent years refining profile pictures, meeting at coffee shops, and worrying that the current person I'm interested in won't feel the same toward me, just like the last one.

I feel like I'm treading water alone in the ocean, and every potential romantic interest is just a passing piece of driftwood that rapidly deteriorates. It's exhausting trying to keep up the effort to stay afloat, especially with how long it takes for the next one to appear.

Right now, I feel particularly lonely because I think it's happening again. The person I really think I click with has, for reasons unbeknownst to me, decided they aren't interested. Every time someone ghosts me, I can't stop myself from trying to piece together what I did wrong, if any. I get that sometimes there just isn't a spark, but this time that makes *zero* sense.

I was fine, too, before I found this person. It's like I'd gotten used to being lonely again, but was briefly reminded how good it feels to be with someone.",1,"the narrative vividly portrays a deep sense of longing and emotional pain, common indicators of loneliness. the author reminisces about past intimate moments and the sense of fulfillment they provided, highlighting a current absence of such connections. the metaphor of treading water alone in the ocean and the transient nature of potential romantic interests underscores the feeling of isolation and the struggle to maintain hope. the repeated cycle of getting ghosted and the introspection about what might have gone wrong further amplify the sense of rejection and self-doubt. the narrative's tone and content reflect a profound yearning for a simple, intimate connection, and the exhaustion from continuous efforts to find it, which are classic symptoms of loneliness."
"My boyfriend just left me for his ex, I have not felt this alone in many months :(Title is pretty self explanatory, we have been arguing for a while, turns out my ""paranoia"" about his whore of an ex was never irrational in the slightest, so fuck them both :/ Decided to watch a film in an attempt make myself feel better, Train To Busan, ended up making me cry like a bitch, good choice on my part, clearly.. if anyone would like to exchange experiences or even just vent about what's upsetting them, I'm happy to listen, I'd just love company in any form right now, even if it's just helping you cope",1,"the narrative reveals deep emotional distress following a recent breakup, which is a significant life event that often triggers feelings of loneliness. the author explicitly states feeling ""alone"" and expresses a desire for company, indicating a need for social connection and support. the mention of watching a film to feel better, but ending up crying, further underscores their emotional vulnerability and isolation. the invitation to others to share their experiences or vent also highlights a yearning for interaction and mutual understanding, common in those experiencing loneliness. these elements collectively suggest a profound sense of loneliness and a struggle to cope with the recent emotional upheaval."
"What a mistakeI think it was a mistake to come here, I already got harrassed by some guy from this subreddit. I came here in search of friends but instead I get more bullied here then I do in irl and of course its some fat weirdo trying to put the blame on me for not showing any interest in him for making the rp really weird and gross...so I guess to him I am gonna be more alone then I already am.

So thanks you loser, thanks for sexualizing my loneliness...",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of loneliness through the author's expressions of distress and frustration. the individual mentions coming to a new place in search of friends, which suggests a desire for social connection and an existing sense of isolation. the experience of harassment and bullying exacerbates their feelings of loneliness, as they compare the negative online interactions to their real-life experiences, indicating a pervasive sense of being misunderstood and mistreated. the specific mention of being more alone and the sarcastic thanks to the person who sexualized their loneliness further highlights their deep-seated feelings of isolation and rejection. these elements collectively underscore the author's struggle with loneliness and their emotional response to the lack of supportive social connections."
"Feeling DisconnectedHey everyone. I am a 40 year old guy who is feeling pretty lonely. I need a deeper connection than I have with most people. I find others don't want a friendship with the kind of depth I want. I also work over nights, so it is hard to find somebody who is available to talk on my schedule.

I am into reading, music, writing, tv/movies, video games, hiking, running, and more. Looking to talk about anything, from the serious to the ridiculous and anything in between.

If you are looking for a genuine friendship, I would love to hear from you.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author explicitly mentions feeling pretty lonely and desiring a deeper connection than what is currently available. this suggests a lack of fulfilling social interactions. the difficulty in finding friends who share a similar desire for depth in relationships further exacerbates feelings of isolation. additionally, working overnight shifts presents a significant barrier to socializing, as it limits the availability of others to engage during the same hours. the author's broad range of interests, including reading, music, writing, tv/movies, video games, hiking, and running, indicates a willingness to connect over various topics, yet this openness does not seem to translate into actual meaningful connections. the invitation for genuine friendship highlights a proactive effort to combat loneliness, underscoring the depth of the author's need for companionship. these elements collectively paint a clear picture of someone experiencing loneliness."
"People of reddit, what is one piece of advice you would give to your lonely self to help ease your pain?Clearly, I am a lonely person.

"I have no friends. Is this weird? Is it bad?I have good friends that I love that live in different cities than me. Right now I am living with my boyfriend who is the life of the party, and I am kind of a homebody. I work from home (so no work friends) and I moved to this new city to be with him (so no existing friends). Luckily my sister and cousin live nearby so I see them once a week or once every other week. 

It??s been several months since I moved here and things are getting kind of stressed at home. I think my boyfriend fell in love with me when I was vibrant and fun and had friends around, but now he??s sick of me because I??m an introvert at home all the time and have no social life. 

He??s quite a bit older than me so all of his friends are old. They have families and kids and some are even retired. I am 26 turning 27. 

It??s so hard to make friends after of college if you don??t like drinking. Don??t know what to do. 

All this said, is my situation weird? Should I feel more self conscious about it? I do feel lonely sometimes but I being that I still have my old friends that I text I don??t feel like I??m completely unlovable. 

I need to get out of the house and have something to do on the weekend. Without feeling completely pathetic. Like this weekend my BF is golfing both days and he asked me if I have plans. I??m embarrassed to tell him I don??t.",1,"the narrative describes a person who has relocated to a new city and is experiencing a lack of social connections. while they mention having good friends who live in different cities and seeing family members occasionally, they express feelings of isolation due to their current circumstances. the individual works from home, which limits opportunities to make work friends, and moved to be with a boyfriend whose social circle is not relatable to them. the stress in their relationship and the contrast between their boyfriend's active social life and their own introverted nature contribute to their sense of loneliness. they express difficulty in making new friends and feel embarrassed about not having plans, which highlights their desire for social interaction and a sense of belonging. these aspects are typical indicators of loneliness, as the person feels disconnected from their surroundings and struggles to form new social bonds, leading to feelings of inadequacy and isolation."
"I can have all the friends in the world but it just doesn't matterWithout a GF by my side my life just feels worthless and nothing. It's hitting me harder than ever recently, I just get so depressed and down when the evening comes.

I miss having her by my side just laying with me, I miss the simple things like smelling her hair, holding her in my arms. her gentle kisses. All of it. It's been too long being single now I hate it so much. No amount of friends or family could ever not make me feel lonely again without a partner

Man I wish I wasn't single, I need a cuddle so badly :(",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of emptiness and longing that is often characteristic of loneliness. the author expresses that despite having friends, their life feels meaningless without a romantic partner, highlighting a deep emotional void. the specific mention of missing physical and emotional intimacy, such as smelling her hair and holding her, underscores a yearning for close personal connection. the feelings of depression and increased sadness during the evenings further indicate a struggle with loneliness. the author's belief that no amount of friends or family can fill the gap left by the absence of a partner strongly suggests an experience of loneliness that goes beyond social isolation, emphasizing a need for intimate companionship."
"I wish I had someone, but now meeting new people in real life seems impossible.This is quite long, so only read if you have time. I'm posting it here just to check whether someone has gone through similar experiences.

Reminiscing my life so far, I have always been lonely since my childhood. I don't have any siblings, which made it worse. The only friend I had was my neighbor but due to some issues between the families we stopped talking at the age of 6 and then reunited again at age of 10. Later, I made two more friends in 2015 and 2017. That's it. I have only befriended three people in 19 years.

Girls have always hated me for no reason and talked to me rudely. I can't blame them because I am very introverted and I never talked a lot back in school. However, a girl befriended me in kindergarten and the friendship lasted till second grade. She was the only friend I made in school till that point of time. I have acquainted a lot of people since then, but nobody really wanted to be friends with me. People that I thought were friends didn't even care about me in the end. I am a background character in people's lives who they can approach when they have no one to talk to or need some help.

In 2017, I approached a girl in high school for the first time in my entire life hoping to spark a friendship. I managed to get her phone number after a first few interactions. We used to chat everyday but she never wanted to spend time with me in real life as she wanted to attend lectures. Eight months later, she started ignoring my messages, started replying late and even started bunking classes. I soon realized that she got into a relationship with a guy from another class whom she met only three weeks ago. I never messaged her again. After graduating from high school she messaged me and even called me thrice asking me whether I had ""forgotten"" her. I blocked her everywhere and never heard from her again. The guy must have dumped her.

I befriended a girl again in college (2018). This was unexpected because all I did was solve her doubts regarding academics a few times. And then we developed a virtual friendship gradually. But in the end, the same thing happened. She started ignoring me soon. She was already in a relationship, so that wasn't the problem for me. Just like the other girl, she never wanted to spend time with me yet had time to hangout and flirt with other guys. I ended the friendship by telling her how she mistreated me. I was basically just a substitute for other people.

The fact that I don't have any friends who care for me the way I do hurts. Although I consider myself lucky that I have people whom I can call friends, the fact that I'm not a priority for any of them hurts. They are there to support me, but I feel that they're just sympathizing with me.

I have never had any type of meaningful interactions with women all my life. The conversations usually only last for 20-30 seconds. Girls have turned me down even for friendship. I have been blocked just for sending ""Hi"" to a classmate. I wonder what's wrong with me, because I look pretty average and I can talk confidently enough with people but nobody ever seems to be interested in getting to know me. I wonder how people around me get in and out of relationships so quickly.

At this point, I really crave for a strong emotional and physical connection with someone but I can't do anything about it. Every girl I come across is already in a relationship. Most of my acquaintances are in a relationship?? or at least are close friends with females. After having so many bad experiences with girls, I don't trust anyone anymore. Even if a girl is interested in me at some point of time, I won't be able to pick any hints. If I get into a relationship, I will perhaps be a terrible partner as I absolutely have no idea of what women like. I can't spend money to make her happy by buying gifts or flowers. I feel like a total failure in life. I have tried to cope with my loneliness developing a lot of hobbies and that has helped me in the long term, but in the end, being lonely is just devastating.

I won't even need a lot of friends if I had a person who will love me to the core, someone I can tell everything about and vice versa. But it just seems impossible at this point of time. Now you'll probably tell me that I'm just 19 and I have a long life ahead, but as the years pass by the probability of meeting new people is decreasing as well. I'm in college now and the class won't shuffle till the final year. None of my friends will introduce me to their friends and I will probably become a freelancer in future so I don't have any chances of making new friends (both male and female) or getting into a relationship. Now I'm apprehensive to even approach people because I can't bear to see all my effort and time that I have spent go waste for people who don't give a shit about me. I'm sure I'm not the only one to experience this, but I have lost all my hope.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and a recurring pattern of unfulfilled social connections. the individual recounts a history of limited friendships, strained interactions, and feelings of being a background character in others' lives. the longing for meaningful relationships and the repeated rejections, particularly from women, contribute to a pervasive sense of loneliness. the writer's introspection about their inability to form lasting bonds, coupled with their belief that they are not a priority to anyone, underscores their emotional pain. their efforts to cope through hobbies highlight a struggle to find solace in solitude, but the persistent craving for a deep emotional connection remains unmet. the narrative is saturated with feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness about future social prospects, reflecting typical indicators of loneliness."
"Want someone to text withI'm 27 and currently a stay at home mom to a 5 year old starting kindergarten soon. I moved to a small town where I don't know anybody and the pandemic as well as fires have me feeling pretty isolated. I love reading, movies, music, horror/Halloween, Doctor Who, food, hiking, and art.  Hit me up of you want to chat!",1,"the narrative reflects several indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions feeling isolated, which is a direct expression of loneliness. the context of being a stay-at-home mom in a new town without any known acquaintances adds to the sense of social isolation. the reference to the pandemic and fires exacerbates this feeling by limiting opportunities for social interaction. the desire to find someone to text with highlights the need for social connection and companionship. interests like reading, movies, and hiking are often solitary activities, which can further contribute to feelings of loneliness if not balanced with social engagements. overall, the narrative is characterized by a longing for social interaction and a sense of being cut off from a supportive community."
"What's your worst experience being lonely?I just a few months old realized that I have a social anxiety and the fact that it has caused me really poor performance at school and building network for my future. I have a really cold relationship with my dormitory mates, and I'm sure they all think I'm weird. 

Since corona, I count I cry at least once every month out of loneliness. The first few months of 2020 were even worse, as I cried every week (but that also because I had depression). I talk everyday to myself, in front of the mirror, or in front of my stuffy animal. Many times I pretend to have a call with an imaginary someone to avoid talking to my dorm mates in the common room. When my loneliness peaks, often I feel physically cold that I shiver. Every night before I sleep, I always fantasize about having someone I can come home to, whom I can hug and talk with - and believe me, that's the best time of the day for me. I like to sit by my window every evening on my bean bag, watching anyone passing by the road and even listening to their conversation - just so that I feel some human exposure. I cried two or three times while eating my dinner on my desk because I never share a meal with anyone since I came to this town. I always feel self-conscious when I shop at the supermarket or when I walk around the park, because I feel people stare at me with pity because I look like a loner. I ate alone in the cafeteria three times, to which on the third time my classmates caught me and I was deeply embarrassed because they knew how lonely I was - so I stopped eating there ever since.",1,"the narrative describes a deeply personal and emotional struggle with loneliness. the author mentions several key indicators that are typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness. they talk about social anxiety, which has impacted their performance in school and their ability to build a network for the future. the cold relationship with dormitory mates and the belief that they are perceived as weird further isolates them. crying frequently out of loneliness, especially during the initial months of the pandemic, points to an intense emotional distress. engaging in conversations with themselves or pretending to be on a call to avoid interaction with others highlights a coping mechanism often used by those feeling isolated. the physical sensation of coldness when loneliness peaks, fantasizing about companionship, and the best part of their day being the fantasy of having someone to come home to are poignant examples of their longing for connection. sitting by the window to watch and listen to others for a semblance of human exposure, crying during meals due to eating alone, and feeling self-conscious in public places due to perceived pity are all strong indicators of the depth of their loneliness. the embarrassment from being seen eating alone by classmates, leading to avoidance of the cafeteria, underscores the social stigma they feel. these aspects collectively paint a clear picture of someone grappling with profound loneliness."
~IDK~I am not feeling ok right now. I just wish I could be in a loving environment. I just feel like I can??t talk to anyone. I don??t feel like eating. But I am fine. Sorry that I am being a Debby downer. Sorry... I will probably delete this later anyway.,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional distress and isolation. the individual expresses a desire to be in a loving environment, which suggests a lack of emotional support and connection in their current situation. the statement about not feeling able to talk to anyone indicates a significant barrier to social interaction and communication, a common symptom of loneliness. the mention of not feeling like eating could be a sign of depression or severe emotional strain, both of which are often associated with loneliness. despite the person saying they are ""fine,"" the overall tone of the message contradicts this, revealing underlying pain and sorrow. apologizing for being a ""debby downer"" and the intention to delete the message later also imply a fear of burdening others and a lack of self-worth, further underscoring their loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone who is struggling with feelings of isolation and a longing for meaningful connections."
Life After CollegeAnybody experience post grad loneliness or depression? Seems like since I graduated my social circle has shrunk and it??s harder and harder to get together with people I used to see almost daily. Any recommendations?,1,"the narrative reflects typical indicators of loneliness, particularly in the context of life transitions. the author mentions experiencing a shrinking social circle and difficulty maintaining connections with people they used to see frequently, which are common experiences that contribute to feelings of loneliness. the question about whether others have experienced similar post-graduation loneliness or depression suggests a search for validation and understanding, a sign of feeling isolated. the request for recommendations indicates a desire for social engagement and connection, further underscoring the sense of loneliness. these elements collectively highlight the emotional and social challenges that often accompany significant life changes, such as transitioning from college to post-grad life."
"Now allowed anything in lifeI only have to go out to a supermarket or busy store to be reminded I'm not allowed anything in life. I'm likely older than most you here, 31 but I spent my entire life isolated. I'm not allowed work, friends, relationship.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and exclusion from fundamental aspects of life such as work, friendships, and relationships. the individual expresses a feeling of being constantly reminded of their isolation when they go out in public, which suggests a pervasive sense of being different or disconnected from others. the mention of spending their entire life in isolation highlights a chronic experience of loneliness. the reference to age, while noting they are older than most, further underscores a prolonged duration of this experience. these elements collectively point to a profound sense of loneliness, as the individual feels excluded from normal social interactions and life opportunities."
VentSo spring break is next week and I??m going to spend it alone. My friend basically said that she was busy all week. I know she isn??t that busy lol. I??m just so frustrated because I feel like all my relationships are dying. I??m scared everyone is just going to drop me after we graduate. I??ve been trying to date around and it??s just a mess. I??ve been in the talking stage with a guy for a year and he has yet to ask me on a date. A guy today asked me out but then he found out that I am a liberal and agnostic and yeah. I??m just sad. Am I really going to be alone forever?,1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and concern about future social connections. the author expresses frustration about spending spring break alone and perceives that their friend is not being truthful about being busy, indicating feelings of rejection and mistrust. the mention of relationships ""dying"" and fear of being abandoned after graduation highlights a significant anxiety about long-term social bonds. the struggles with dating, including a prolonged talking stage without progression and a recent rejection based on personal beliefs, further exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and sadness. the concluding question about being alone forever underscores a profound fear of perpetual loneliness. these elements collectively point to a strong experience of loneliness, characterized by social disconnection, fear of abandonment, and unsuccessful attempts to form meaningful relationships."
"I hate my life I'm so patheticI have no friends what's so ever , I'm depressed so I rely on semi strangers in the internet to keep me company and make me feel good... I hate how pathetic I'm refreshing pages over and over waiting for someone to say anything ...",1,"the narrative clearly indicates feelings of deep loneliness and despair. the author explicitly mentions having no friends and feeling depressed, which are strong indicators of social isolation and emotional distress. the reliance on semi-strangers on the internet for company suggests a lack of meaningful real-life connections, further highlighting their loneliness. the repetitive action of refreshing pages in hopes of interaction underscores a desperate need for social engagement and validation, common in lonely individuals. the self-deprecating language, such as calling themselves ""pathetic,"" reflects low self-esteem and a negative self-view, which are often associated with chronic loneliness. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness."
"Feels so lonely :(i am very unhappy for the past 1 year, i got in treatment but it does not help :""(",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of unhappiness and a prolonged period of distress, which are common indicators of loneliness. the explicit mention of feeling lonely and the sad emoticon reinforce the emotional state of the individual. the fact that the person has sought treatment but finds it ineffective further highlights their ongoing struggle and sense of isolation. this prolonged dissatisfaction and the lack of improvement despite seeking help suggest a profound sense of disconnection and helplessness, which are key psychological markers of loneliness."

Just listening to each other and talk about everything and anything.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and a strong desire for meaningful human connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual's repeated attempts to reach out, as noted by ""everyone i text doesn't reply back,"" highlight their struggle to form reciprocal relationships. the emphasis on needing ""a real friend"" and ""a good person"" underscores their yearning for genuine companionship and support. the plea for someone who can ""listen to no judgment"" suggests a need for acceptance and understanding, further illustrating their emotional solitude. these elements collectively point to a deep-seated loneliness, as the individual expresses both the pain of social disconnection and the hope for a compassionate connection."
"""Am I on anyone's mind right now?""Does anyone else ever find themselves asking this same question? I don't think I'm very remarkable to other people, or worthy of being on their minds.

I find myself bouncing between various friend groups who slowly distance themselves away from me. I feel rejected and beaten down by every aspect of my life.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and self-doubt, which are key indicators of loneliness. the question ""am i on anyone's mind right now?"" suggests a longing for connection and validation from others. the author expresses a belief that they are not remarkable or worthy of attention, indicating low self-esteem and feelings of insignificance. the desire for the world to forget about them, coupled with the wish to be let in and made happy, highlights a painful contradiction between wanting to disappear and craving meaningful inclusion. the experience of bouncing between friend groups who gradually distance themselves suggests a pattern of social rejection and instability in relationships, further reinforcing feelings of loneliness. the overall tone of rejection and being beaten down by life reflects a pervasive sense of hopelessness and emotional exhaustion, which are common in individuals experiencing chronic loneliness."
"Best friend of 9 years just ??broke up?? with me??So I am a senior nursing major in college, most of my high school friendships have faded out and I go to a private Christian school where I don??t fit in and it??s hard to make friends, on top of that I??m super busy with school and work, and so is everyone else. This has left me feeling very lonely and has me questioning and hating myself for being so broken that no one wants to be friends with me?? I have been struggling with this silently for a while.
Today I reached out to my best friend from middle school, she is the only one from my hometown that hasn??t faded out?? she was super dry with me so I asked what was up.

She told me that she felt like we were falling apart and that we were moving in different directions, saying the distance (1 hour apart) and our different interests (that we??ve always had, that kept us fresh) just weren??t working out anymore. That she was too busy for me and thought we needed to not hang out ??for the time being?? which I can respect, she is working on herself and working to get into grad school. Still I asked her if I had done something wrong and she told me that I hadn??t, that we had just drifted.

I enjoy playing games, (I play on PS4, but don't really have many games. I play Fortnite, Rocket League, Apex, (I am trash at all) and a few others I can't really think of right now.) listening to music, some photography, corny jokes, TACOS, and anything horror or conspiracy related.

I did everything I could to improve. Unfortunately, its still the same. My crippling loneliness is eating me away everyday. My fear of being the only one interested and doing my best is constantly showing. Every women i talk to is not interested and thats fine, they have preferences.

"Hi, you can call me Mr.LonelyFor the past few months I have been feeling something wrong going on in my life, it felt so tasteless, school been so boring and annoying, and work feels even worse. Even when I got my paycheck I was like ""meh :|"", basically because half of it goes to the uni and the other half I live by.
I took a vacation with my friend and a group of students, had some fun, only to come back home, waking up the next morning feeling the exact same.
Yesterday I probably did an average of 3 visits to the fridge each hour in order to find something to put in my mouth and spend some of my time chewing it.
I tried to read books, gave up in the first few pages, tried to take a walk, felt so sleepy and came back home, even riding my bike doesn't feel as fun as usually.
On Instagram I went to the search page, went to a post, and scrolled all the way down to the last suggested post, I didn't even know that page has an end. I close each YouTube video after few minutes for that it's not filling me with whatever I feel I want. And I also liked each possible post on Facebook, I even spent some time scrolling through the ADs.

"Lonely for 2+ yearsHi everyone. I don't know what this post is, maybe I just need to have this off my chest.

I have been lonely for two and a half years, and it's taking a toll on my mind, because I am struggling with the conversation and understanding others. It hurts me to always have to contact people first, yet I see the same people calling others first. And when I say I feel lonely they are like - oh, you know, we all don't have time - but that's a lie - I see them having a plenty of time for others. It's not like I can't make friends or that people dislike me - seems like the opposite, but I don't know why everyone acts like I don't exist, even if I am trying. For all this time, for only 4 days someone gave me a minute of their attention, for all this two and a half years. It feels especially horrible, because, for almost all this time I have been severely sick - daily pains all over my body, and I lie in the bed for a long time because I am tired, having headaches, and so on... And they know it: when I call them I am always sick and laying, still, not even a one support message. It hurts - sometimes I have thoughts of sending them a message how they hurt me neglecting my existence, and telling them to erase my number because I will erase theirs, and I don't act out because there's one hairline of hope it will be better; but it never does.

My current job is fun and to a degree I really enjoy it, however even after being there a year in August I can't shake the feeling none of my colleagues actually want me there. I've had cold shoulders and small chat when I try to talk to people, yet people who were hired at the same time as me seem to be everyone's favourites, and I dont know why.

So much so as a till colleague in a big store occasionally we have to call using our headsets to other colleagues (Such as getting furniture out the warehouse, grabbing a barcode, calling for till colleagues, seeing what we have in stock etc) when they do it usually 3-4 colleagues lap at them to help, yet when I ask something simple such as can we have some till colleagues I get shit back, usually saying do it yourself or just ignored completely, even my manager gives me shit when lines build up and I've called 4 times yet when he calls suddenly 8 people turn up. I'm sick of it.

It doesn't help three particular colleagues I have to buddy up with (We joined their store as extra staff while our new store got pushed back) I've seen talk shit behind my back, even saying I'm hopeless and I'm doing things wrong (When in reality I'm doing it by the books), I've had two of them try convince me prior because I was rather tired working with Rugs/Carpets for 8 hours straight that I should look for something else.

Scared getting a job will make me more lonelyI'm scared of I get a job I'll be more lonely. When you go for a job you have no idea who or how many people you will work with. Or what they'll be like.

Now usually I get home, head up the stairs and as soon as I shut my bedroom door I feel at peace. I can be alone with myself which is often where I??m happiest. Not tonight tho. Tonight I heads up the stairs, shut the bedroom door, left the lights off, collapsed on my bed and burst into tears. 

Why? I wanted a hug. Just a hug, someone to wrap their arms around me and say it was going to be okay. But there??s no one to hug, so I??ll fall asleep hugging my pillow instead.

August 2016 - I move to Spain to study abroad for a year. Everything's going great, making loads of cool new friends and having a pretty good social life. I've always been a weed smoker but it was just easier to get over there so a once-in-a-while habit turned into a can't-live-without-it kind of thing. I'd literally stay in my room from whatever time I woke up until whatever time I fell back asleep just smoking. I think I just liked how it made me feel like.. not a person. Anyway as you can probably guess this fucked me up mentally. This destructive behaviour culminated in me getting a bad case of food poisoning and ending up in the hospital. In Spain. Alone. Attempted suicide. Next day, I called my mum and told her everything, and she flew out to come and get me. What a legend. 

&amp;#x200B;

March 2017 - Back home, lowest point of my life. Crying every day for no reason, completely isolating myself. Sometimes I'd be completely catatonic. Like, I could hear my mum's voice but something in my head told me not to move or make a sound. Kind of scary actually. After a few months of medication I finally start feeling better. Decide to get a job at a local bar. 

&amp;#x200B;

August 2017 - Life is finally getting back on track! You know why? Because I have my first ever boyfriend! He's funny and... actually, he was just funny. I didn't see it like that at the time but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. As the human brain is wont to do, I start convincing myself that this boyfriend is the reason I got better. Of course he was! It totally wasn't my already-fucked-up-brain making arbitrary associations! Obviously! Anyway, I was getting better and it was (apparently) all because of him. I convinced myself that what we had was love. Yeah, he'd make me have sex when I didn't want to, and yeah, he'd belittle me and make nasty jokes about my body to our coworkers, but he said that was love and who was I to argue?! 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2017 - He raped me. He then told everyone we worked with that I'd made up a story about him raping me and not to believe it. He also told everyone about the suicide attempt. Who would believe the crazy girl, right?! I quit.

&amp;#x200B;

November 2017 - Finishing my last year of University. 10th best University in the world. Not a brag, just a lot of fucking pressure. I stop talking to friends. Even when they reached out to me, I couldn't bring myself to reply. They all eventually drop off the radar. My fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

September 2018 - At least I graduated, right?! Not a terrible GPA, not a great one. But I did it! I have a degree! Now what?

&amp;#x200B;

June 2019 - I've been unemployed since September. I've got a great degree, but no friends, no job and no money. I live at home with my parents and my cat. I don't talk to anyone. I stay in bed all day and watch youtube videos. I'm trying to come to terms with all of this but I honestly don't know how. I can't even get an entry level admin job because I have no experience. I speak four languages and have an IQ of 129. What the fuck is the point of all of that if I can't afford to do an unpaid internship? You need experience to get a job but you need to get a job to get experience. Fucking A.

"4 days alone.I last worked 4 days ago, I used some paid time off on-top of my already scheduled days off to have a little break. In those 4 days no one has messaged me at all. Noone checked if I was doing well, or even just to say hi.
I understand alot of people go more than 4 days without talking to people, I have at times aswell. 

The people who could've reached out to me in those 4 days are my co workers, they are my ""friends"". Superficial, if even that.

I'm always that person who's just kind of ""there."" Most see me as simply ""the quiet girl."" Others see me as someone who is nice but awkward. They may enjoy my company when no one else is around, but otherwise I'm pretty forgettable to them.

I envy people with partners who think they're absolutely amazing. And I envy people who have a non-one-sided best friend. How do others find that level of closeness with someone? It's such a foreign concept to me.

Even with people I *think* I'm close with, I'll later learn that we really weren't that close. For this reason, I have to be cautious when getting to know new people. It's painful to realize that someone meant more to you than you did to them.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep yearning for meaningful connections and a sense of being valued by others, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses a desire to be someone's favorite and to truly mean something to someone, highlighting a perceived lack of such relationships in their life. they mention feeling like ""the quiet girl"" and being seen as nice but awkward, suggesting a sense of invisibility and social discomfort. the writer's envy of people with close, reciprocal relationships underscores their feelings of isolation and unfulfilled social needs. the mention of caution when forming new connections due to past disappointments further indicates a pattern of unreciprocated emotional investment, reinforcing the narrative of loneliness. overall, the writer's reflections on their social experiences and desires point to a significant struggle with feeling connected and valued, which are core aspects of loneliness."

While I feel like I should just move on from her since she clearly doesn??t like me anymore, she??s the only person I really can talk to at this point so I don??t want to just stop talking to her out right. This has been going on for months now and I feel like the longer this goes on the worse my mental health gets. I just don??t know what to do anymore.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a sense of isolation and emotional pain due to the perceived rejection by their best friend. despite efforts to communicate, they are met with indifference, which exacerbates their feelings of abandonment. the person's reliance on this single relationship highlights a lack of other social connections, further deepening their loneliness. the prolonged duration of this situation, coupled with the negative impact on their mental health, underscores the depth of their emotional distress. the uncertainty and helplessness conveyed in the narrative are typical signs of someone grappling with loneliness and seeking meaningful social interaction."

It makes me feel like I'm not capable of doing things I should and that in lazy and useless. I have tried making conversations with people and stuff but I can't make people want to talk to me again. I crave human touch and I wish someone would hug me and kiss me or just put their hand on my shoulder",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness through several indicators. the author mentions a history of having friends, which their therapist uses to suggest they are capable of forming relationships again. however, the author expresses feelings of failure and inadequacy because they are unable to recreate these connections. the reference to their brain being ""wired after years of loneliness and sadness"" suggests a prolonged period of isolation, which can significantly impact mental health and self-perception. their efforts to engage with others are met with frustration, as they feel unable to sustain conversations or connections, leading to a sense of helplessness. the intense craving for human touch and simple gestures of affection, such as a hug or a hand on the shoulder, underscores a profound need for physical and emotional intimacy that is currently unmet. these elements collectively highlight the author's struggle with loneliness and their deep yearning for meaningful human connection."

"Ghost HuntingStory of my life...

It's an erie night in September, and the protagonist results back to old habbits in order keep her perpetual fear of loneliness at bay. Not yet possesed by the engulfing howls of winter, she searched for a source of warmth. She participates in what she now knows is an unhealthy habbit of ghost hunting. On that night she reaches out to a soul whom she believes mirror hers. A message is sent and, to her surprise, he responds. There's a bit of a delay, but thats to be expected. He's from another world and has the accent to prove it. She thought she summoned *the one*. You know, the one that would enter her world and make her real. It's been forever since her skins been touched. Her heart? An unpenetratable, depsite the gaping hole. What she hoped to accomplish with this new link was simple. Never has she ever fallin so deep to the sound of someones voice. When he spoke it was clear, audible, vocal. She wished for him to voice her name, for it to echo through her tunnels (rendered deeper with each failed attempt to make contact with the other side), summoning her. For a momment she believed she had nailed the ritual. She began the exchange by trading sight for sound. Enlighted by the flash from her camera she highlighed her body, all her flaws on display. ""Your perfect"" he insisted. So she persisted. Hed drop an octive or two untill his voice reached a growl. Shed almost forgotten his true nature. You see before climax could be reached the connection was dropped. The piercing silence that followed hollowed her. Her lover boy was not a lover or a boy. In fact, he was never really there. What she experience was not a dream, but a fantasy. She wished for love the way a kid wishes for candy or a dog fo a bone. Though they never touched, he was quite handsy, came, became person unkonwn. Where he went or why hed gone shed never know. All I can tell you is he dried up like the desert, she blowed up, went bezzerk. Ghost hunting took up the rest of the night. She raked through the graveyard in search for a bone. She attempted to read every tomestone?? too, but her dyslexia got in the way. She still wanted him to say her name. She didnt know her destiny untill he spelled it out for her. No matter how she twisted and turned her body for him (and the other hims) she could not escape her destiny. All she could do now is hope someone would search for her, after they bury her in the dark of night.",1,"the narrative vividly illustrates a profound sense of isolation and longing for connection. the protagonist's engagement in ghost hunting is metaphorical, symbolizing her search for something intangible and elusive. her actions, driven by a deep-seated fear of loneliness, highlight her desperation to find warmth and companionship. the narrative's portrayal of her reaching out to a seemingly kindred spirit, only to be met with an ephemeral and ultimately unfulfilling interaction, underscores her emotional void. her belief that this connection could make her feel ""real"" reflects a common symptom of loneliness, where individuals seek validation and meaning through others. the description of her heart as ""unpenetratable"" despite its gaping hole is a poignant metaphor for her emotional state, indicating a profound and unhealed wound. her subsequent reaction to the loss of this fleeting connection, described as going ""bezzerk,"" further emphasizes her fragile emotional state and the depth of her loneliness. the narrative's conclusion, with her hope that someone might search for her after her demise, encapsulates the ultimate desire for recognition and connection, even in death. these elements collectively paint a vivid picture of an individual deeply entrenched in loneliness, seeking solace in fleeting and ultimately unsatisfactory interactions."

I feel so behind socially it??s a joke. This world is meant to be lived in other peoples company, and yes I??m really aiming this towards romantic company.

When you??re alone, with nothing but your thoughts at night and no one to tell you they love you, or how much you mean to them, it hurts too much.

I can??t date, I can??t effortlessly talk to people especially girls, they can sense I??m insecure, unsure of myself and depressed, it??s written all over my body language and demeanour, I think I??ll die alone and never know how it feels like to fall in love.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and social anxiety. the author describes an intense observation of others' social interactions, which they view as effortless and confident, contrasting sharply with their own struggles. this comparison exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and social incompetence. the mention of feeling ""behind socially"" and the use of phrases like ""it hurts too much"" and ""i think i’ll die alone"" highlight profound emotional pain and despair. the emphasis on romantic loneliness, the longing for companionship, and the fear of perpetual solitude are clear indicators of loneliness. the narrative also reflects a lack of self-esteem and pervasive insecurity, particularly in social and romantic contexts, which are common psychological markers of loneliness. the author’s internal monologue at night, focusing on their solitude and the absence of affirming relationships, underscores the depth of their loneliness."

Now I don??t know what to do, my messages have not had a notification in forever, I hav t been invited to anything since my brother graduated, at this point I don??t care if it??s fake, I just want someone to talk to, I see these people being happy with girlfriends or friends in general, I don??t even know anyone well enough to talk to them and explain how I feel. I dont even feel comfortable talking to my parents about it because their convinced im invited to a lot when I??m not. What did I do to deserve this, I??m not asking to be mr popular, but why, why can??t I just be happy for more than 10 minutes, I??m tired of this life and just want to end it, but I can??t because I  don??t want to upset my parents, I can??t stop thinking about it even though it??s breaking my mind apart, I??m so lost in my head I??m stuck, I cannot do this much longer.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and disconnection from others. the individual describes a history of failed attempts to form meaningful relationships, starting with the loss of childhood friends and continuing with unsuccessful efforts to integrate into new social circles. they mention feeling like an outsider, never being anyone's first choice for companionship, and not being invited to social gatherings, which underscores their feelings of exclusion. the narrative also highlights a deep yearning for connection, even if it's superficial, just to have someone to talk to. the person's sense of loneliness is further compounded by their perception that others are happy and connected, which contrasts sharply with their own experience. they also express a reluctance to share their feelings with their parents, who seem unaware of the depth of their isolation. the narrative culminates in expressions of despair and hopelessness, indicating that the individual's loneliness is severely impacting their mental health and overall well-being."
I'm just tired of being left behindIt's like everyone in my life is moving on without me and I'm just left to dwell on everything.,1,"the narrative expresses feelings of being left behind and a sense of stagnation while others move forward, which are common indicators of loneliness. the writer mentions being ""tired of being left behind,"" highlighting a recurring emotional state of isolation and abandonment. this sentiment is further emphasized by the phrase ""everyone in my life is moving on without me,"" suggesting a perceived lack of connection and support from others. the use of ""dwell on everything"" implies an introspective focus on negative emotions and experiences, often associated with loneliness. these elements collectively point to an experience of feeling disconnected and emotionally isolated from social relationships and life progress, which are typical indicators of loneliness."
"Justifiable Loneliness and ConfusionHi all. I hope you are all having an amazing start to your new year.

I am a F18 having a little trouble coping with my loneliness from this past year and for a while it was able to go away and I was content with myself but every now and then it creeps up on me in overwhelming power. I crumble down immediately. I loose sense of perspective in all aspects of my life. I truly feel as if there is no one I can talk to because no one understands my sense of worthlessness to the people around me. 

I also have this problem where I feel my loneliness is unjustifiable because I am stable in all aspects of my life . I go to a great university, my family is all healthy, Im financially stable, yet I still feel as if I am not good enough for the world around me. 

Throughout high school I always had friends, but I never considered any of them the so called ""best friends"" I never understood that someone other than a family member could be that close to me until college where I now feel like I have made genuine friendships. Even though I have found and made some genuine friendships in college, I still feel like I am inadequate and undeserving of those friendships. I am scared that those people mean more to me than I mean to them. Over this winter break I can't help but feel as if I am just a nobody that no one prioritizes or values.

I am sitting here ringing in the new years with my so called high school ""friends"" ditching me and not inviting me to hang out with them, many I have not seen for months, and my college friends being much more accepted and validated in their home towns. I do not know where I stand in the world, I do not believe anyone values me more than just a speck of dust. But I am also confused as if my loneliness and confusion on my self value is even justified in the first place. I do not know what  I am asking for out of you guys, I just know I need answers.

Here is to 2019 being a lot kinder to all of us.

&amp;#x200B;",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and confusion. the individual expresses a struggle with feelings of worthlessness and a lack of connection, despite having positive external circumstances such as a good university, a healthy family, and financial stability. this juxtaposition between external stability and internal turmoil is a common indicator of loneliness. the writer mentions a recurring sense of overwhelming loneliness that causes them to lose perspective in all aspects of life, highlighting the emotional impact. they also discuss their fear of not being valued by others, feeling inadequate and undeserving of friendships, and experiencing social rejection from high school friends. these feelings of being undervalued and isolated, despite forming genuine connections in college, further underscore the loneliness. the narrative is filled with self-doubt and a search for validation, both of which are typical indicators of someone experiencing loneliness. the individual's confusion about whether their loneliness is justified adds another layer of emotional distress, illustrating the complex and often irrational nature of loneliness. overall, the narrative captures the essence of someone grappling with deep-seated loneliness and a yearning for meaningful connections and self-worth."
"I hate being sadI'm going to start off by telling youse I'm a male, 16 and an introvert and I don't really like being around a large amount of people and it's hard for me to make friends let alone actually talk to someone I don't know irl. When I'm at school I always feel like people are talking about me although they most likely aren't and sometimes I get my words mixed around which is very annoying when I'm reading out loud. Anyways I officially have no real life friends. I have 20 friends on my PS4 but I only play with one of them a lot besides my older brother. I'm being honest when I say my online friends have given me more friendship than my real ones. I messaged one of my real friends last week just saying ""how are you going?"" And he just left me on read, I try messaging others and they just leave me on read. When I message an online friend they will respond within 3 minutes (that's if they're not busy or sleeping). I'm not talking to my "" real friends"" anymore because I had a lot of time with my own thoughts and realised I'm like a background character in my small group at school. They plan dinners and going to the movies but I'm never told about it until after they have done it. Now I don't mind sitting alone at school but when I'm home it just makes me sad. I can't even focus at school well because I can't pay attention in class, not that I don't want to it's just that I get distracted fast. I'm probably just going to go mute at school now. 

Sorry if this looks like in asking for pity or if this makes no damn sense but I haven't cried for years and all of a sudden the little things are hurting me to the point where I start getting horrible thoughts. I think I just need a friend who has things in common with me.

Again sorry if you have trouble reading this incase this makes no sense.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the individual describes difficulty in making friends and engaging in social interactions, which is a common characteristic of loneliness. their sense of being excluded or overlooked by their peers, such as not being invited to social events, further exacerbates feelings of isolation. the reliance on online friendships over real-life connections highlights a gap in meaningful, face-to-face interactions. the mention of feeling like a background character and the emotional impact of being ignored by supposed friends are clear signs of social disconnection. the writer's admission of feeling sad at home and experiencing distractions at school suggests a pervasive sense of loneliness that affects multiple areas of their life. the narrative also includes expressions of emotional distress, such as the sudden onset of crying and horrible thoughts, which are often associated with profound feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative contains numerous elements that align with the experiences of someone who is lonely, including social isolation, emotional pain, and a longing for genuine companionship."
"I honestly wish I could have the mindset of a recluse and not feel the need for social interaction.I am a contradictory loner.

I ache for making human connections, yet I??m beginning to suspect I am asocial. It??s very conflicting to feel like I??m all alone yet I have very little desire to create or maintain interpersonal relationships with anyone.

I have my wife and daughter and they are all that keep me sane. Other than coworkers; they are the only two people in my life.

I wish I could be more like this [guy.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Thomas_Knight) I sometimes imagine me living my life similarly if not for having a wife a daughter.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep internal conflict and a sense of isolation despite having close family ties. the author expresses a desire for human connections but simultaneously feels asocial, indicating a struggle with maintaining interpersonal relationships. the use of phrases like ""i ache for making human connections"" and ""i??m all alone"" are strong indicators of loneliness. the reliance on their wife and daughter for sanity further underscores their limited social circle and the emotional burden placed on these relationships. this contradiction between wanting connection and feeling detached is a common experience for those dealing with loneliness, making the narrative's context and specific examples relevant to the classification."
27m lonely as heckLooking to maybe discord someone ?,1,"the narrative indicates a strong sense of loneliness, as evidenced by the individual's explicit statement of feeling ""lonely as heck."" the use of casual and informal language suggests a desire for connection in a relaxed and approachable manner, which is often a way for lonely individuals to lower barriers to communication and increase the likelihood of social interaction. the mention of looking to ""maybe discord someone"" highlights the person's active search for companionship and social engagement, further underscoring their need for human connection. this kind of direct and open expression of loneliness, combined with the proactive approach to seeking out social interaction, are clear indicators of the individual's current emotional state."
"What??s wrong with meHonestly I??m an okay looking guy, I had girls literally doing the most so I can talk to them and me I just don??t know how to act I??m really shy really bad anxiety.. I see everyone in a group talking and I??m just left out due to people thinking I??m rude .. but in reality I have so much anxiety it??s driving me insane honestly I lost so many chances at friendships and relationships w girls .. I??m so tired I just want to sleep forever :/",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and social anxiety. the individual describes themselves as shy and suffering from severe anxiety, which prevents them from engaging in social interactions. they express feeling left out and misunderstood by others, who perceive them as rude rather than anxious. this misperception leads to missed opportunities for friendships and romantic relationships, exacerbating their feelings of loneliness. the repeated mention of lost chances and the desire to ""sleep forever"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and fatigue, both common in individuals experiencing loneliness. the narrative's tone and content clearly indicate a struggle with connecting to others and a pervasive sense of being alone despite being surrounded by people."
"I Feel Like Nobody Wants to Talk or Listen to MeI only have a few people I consider friends. And I??m pretty lucky to have them, I??ve known them for a while and they??re definite not fake friends. So I don??t know why nobody including them ever tries to talk with me.

I never get any messages just asking what??s up, and most days if I don??t try to talk to someone, then I??m not talking to anyone that day. I don??t know how long I??d be able to just be a hermit before someone asks where I??ve been, but it??s a thought I have that makes me kinda sad considering I could just be missing and I don??t think they??d notice.

Then there??s the issue with when I try to talk to people. I really don??t think anybody cares. I??ll be with people and everyone??s just talking, but any time I say something either the conversation dies or I get interrupted. The latter has been happening for so long that I just shut up when it does happen without even thinking about it. After a few times I??ll realize what??s going on and start to try and notice if it??s happening to anyone else there. Usually it??s not.

So often I find myself wanting to tell someone about something only to pour over all the people I know and think?? They don??t care. Why would they? They never cared before. Or I feel like what I have to say is too weird and would be awkward to bring up to them.

I like talking with new people, because a lot of the time they??re kind and will ask me something and actually try to listen, but I??m pretty shy so I have a hard time actually making a connection with them.

I guess I just want to note that I don??t want people questioning my friendships. If it was as simple as what I said here then no I wouldn??t be friends with them, but there are so many more reasons why I am. This is just the one thing that really makes me feel lonely sometimes.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and disconnection despite the presence of friends. the individual expresses feelings of being unheard and unnoticed, even by those they consider close. the lack of communication and initiative from friends to reach out contributes to their loneliness, as they mention not receiving messages or inquiries about their well-being. the repeated experience of being interrupted or ignored during conversations further exacerbates their sense of invisibility and insignificance. the individual’s hesitation to share personal thoughts and the belief that others do not care or would find their contributions awkward highlight a pervasive sense of self-doubt and social anxiety. the preference for interacting with new people, who seem more attentive, contrasts with the difficulty in forming lasting connections due to shyness, reinforcing their struggle with loneliness. overall, the narrative captures the emotional pain and frustration of feeling alone in a crowd, which are key indicators of loneliness."
"Im out of a relationship and im just plain lonely.I recently got out of a 4 year relationship and decided to try to do things that would make me happy. I was hoping making friends would be one of them but honestly, im lonlier now than ever. My ex and I are still good friends but since we broke up, shes made more friends now than ever and hangs out with them often. Meanwhile, I have a hard time even getting old friends to text me back. No new friends and barely any old friends. I try not to think about it and try to focus on myself but I always have the thought: ""this would be fun with a friend"" or ""man im bored. I should try to hang out with some friends"" but it never happens. Ive always been kind of a quiet person. I guess this is the drawback. At this point, I just spend a lot of time alone at the house or at the bar when im not at work. I just dont know what to do anymore. Being lonely isnt eating at me or anything. It just makes me really sad. Like i have nobody.",1,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing a significant sense of loneliness following the end of a long-term relationship. they express feelings of isolation despite efforts to engage in activities that might bring happiness, such as making new friends. the comparison between their social situation and that of their ex-partner, who has successfully expanded her social circle, exacerbates their feelings of loneliness. specific indicators of loneliness include the difficulty in maintaining communication with old friends, the absence of new friendships, and the recurring thoughts about wanting to share experiences with friends. the person's self-awareness of being a quiet individual and the resulting struggle to form new social connections highlight a typical challenge faced by those who feel lonely. the narrative also mentions spending a lot of time alone, both at home and in social settings like bars, which further underscores the depth of their loneliness. despite their attempts to focus on themselves, the persistent sadness and the feeling of having nobody are clear indicators of their emotional state."

"Is Loneliness A State of Mind?Why do we, Humans feel Lonely? If all other needs are met, then why do we have to experience this  ??pain?? that drives us to socialize with others? We no longer need this evolutionary need for cooperation as the world has become less communal and more individualistic. Also isn??t any emotion a state of mind that one could detach from? In my case loneliness has caused me to be Mildly depressed, but how can that be if I never have attempted to socialize? I either accept loneliness as an unchangeable fact and get on with my life, though this steeliness doesn??t last very long. Or I feel depressed about my situation, but during that it causes me to be introspective. Which has lead me to ask myself why I feel depressed if I haven??t even attempted to socialize with anyone yet?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep contemplation of loneliness and its effects on the individual's mental state. the writer questions the necessity of social interaction despite their basic needs being met, indicating a struggle with understanding their own feelings of isolation. phrases like ""pain that drives us to socialize"" and ""loneliness has caused me to be mildly depressed"" reveal an internal conflict and a sense of suffering associated with their solitary state. the individual’s introspection and acknowledgment of feeling depressed without attempting to socialize highlight a typical pattern of loneliness, where the person is aware of their isolation but feels unable to change their situation. this introspective questioning and the described emotional impact are clear indicators of loneliness."

I just feel really embarrassed whenever that happens and I??m really not looking forward to it. I did see that there were new people joining my class this year so I??m hoping I could try and talk to them but I??m the most awkward person ever.. I have a feeling that tomorrow won??t be that great of a day...????,1,"the narrative expresses a sense of loneliness through several key indicators. the individual explicitly mentions feeling lonely and describes a scenario where they anticipate being alone at school due to their friends' absence. this anticipation of solitude in a social setting contributes to their feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness, common emotions associated with loneliness. the person also expresses a lack of confidence in social interactions, labeling themselves as awkward and doubting their ability to connect with new classmates. these self-perceptions and the anxiety about being alone in a public setting are typical indicators of loneliness, highlighting their concern about social acceptance and belonging."

He seems to have friends judging from facebook but yeah its facebook so I dont put too much value on that. For the past few years I have been wondering like what the hell, should I just send him a message? I am afraid I guess of what might happen or that he wants nothing to do with me. We were going through puberty and it was a time for me when I had huge anxiety about everything and made poor decisions. From my side, I am completely on good terms with the guy.

What's the point man?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a void that nobody else seems to notice, highlighting their internal struggle and the lack of external validation or understanding. the desire to be around people juxtaposed with the dissatisfaction when in their presence suggests a profound emotional disconnect. describing interactions as ""shallow and empty"" underscores the lack of meaningful connections. the distinction between being called a ""best friend"" and viewing others merely as acquaintances points to a significant emotional distance and difficulty in forming deeper bonds. the inability to recall the last time someone was more than an acquaintance further emphasizes a prolonged experience of loneliness. finally, the rhetorical question about the point of it all suggests a sense of hopelessness and existential despair, often associated with chronic loneliness."

I don't know where to start this. Well. I could say I miss having friends. Having people with whom I could just talk. Just vent and just you know... Socially interact with. I wish I wasn't lonely. Well, the times where I had friends is over i guess. It doesn't really matter much.

"Sad birthdayI moved away for medical school to a different country and it??s been hard dealing with that in itself. I miss my friends, my family, my relationship didn??t survive the distance (other problems too). Mostly I just miss being home and surrounded by familiar things/places/people. 

Yesterday was my birthday, and we had a huge exam. For weeks my friends have been talking about how we??re going to go out after and celebrate. We always go out after exams so I figured it??d be the usual, plus a cupcake or fancy shot. The other day I went to the post office to pick up a present my mom had sent, and went back to school with puffy eyes from crying. My friends called me out and I told them how I was homesick and this is my first birthday without the people I??ve known my whole life. They assured me we??d have a great time after the exam to cheer me up. One of my friends is our class social chair (just tells ppl where we??re drinking after exams) and she said she??d pick a chill but fun place to go. I asked her Saturday night what the plan was and she said she??s between a couple places but would let me know before everyone else, cool. It was her own birthday about a week ago and we all sacrificed a night of studying to go into the city for a pricey dinner, so I know she takes birthdays seriously.

Well I get to school before the exam, don??t see them and no texts but exams in an hour, I wouldn??t be wishing anyone a hbd either. Exam ends. I wait in the group study room where their book bags are for half an hour, thinking they??d finished earlier and went to get coffee or something. No texts, no hbd or ??hey we??ll be right back??. I leave to buy some champagne and clean up my apartment, thinking I??d host a little pregame tn. One friend texts to ask how we can submit our histology assignment... nothing else.

At this point I was just sad and moping, figured I didn??t want to go out anyways since I didn??t sleep last night. I don??t like confrontation or attention so I wasn??t going to say anything either. I just took a nap, figured some plans would be made by the time I woke up. I wake up to pictures of my friends with other classmates out for drinks and dinner. 

I didnt even want to do anything, I only got my hopes up because they said we would do something. It would??ve been nice to at least get a text and a hug or a smile, that??s all I needed today. Instead I just spent the rest of the day in bed crying, and I??m probably going to do the same thing tomorrow.",1,"the narrative reveals deep feelings of isolation and longing for connection. the author describes moving away for medical school, which has been challenging due to missing friends, family, and the end of a relationship. these factors are common contributors to loneliness. the author's homesickness is evident, especially as they recount their first birthday away from lifelong acquaintances. the anticipation of celebrating with new friends, only to be let down, amplifies their sense of isolation. the lack of communication and support from friends on their birthday further highlights their feelings of being overlooked and unimportant. the disappointment and sadness culminate in spending the day crying and feeling disconnected, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the narrative's focus on unmet emotional needs and the absence of meaningful social interactions underscore the author's experience of loneliness."

"A cup flooded with emptinessSo guys/gals, I tried it all.

I was somewhat OK with my life up until 2 years ago, not even anything to do with Covid, it's just the eternal loneliness and the fact that I push everyone away from me, mostly those who really wanna love me.

I can't put my feelings down and my mind feels like a gas giant where nothing makes sense, all I want is someone to be real with, but nobody likes sad people I guess, so I just go ahead and be me. Everyone else thinks I'm doing pretty good, so even when I try to vent I don't get the actual support I need, leaving me socially exhausted and I just stumbled upon this reddit because it feels like the best place to vent on, no idea if anyone is reading up to this point,

So anyway, I eat alone, I sleep alone, I don't even feel like talking to anybody - I just listen to Kanye and hit the gym frequently - the only thing I really feel like doing.

I don't even know why all this is happening, I'm studying, I tried to run my own startup and right now I feel like I'm in a point in my life where I did a lot of good beginnings but I actually have 0.00% energy left to do anything, this is chaos, I don't wanna keep being like this,

The fact that scares me the most is that I'm OK with most of it, I just feel like I don't care not having a good job, or living in my current state, like I'm OK with being mediocre, and god damn that sends chills down my spines just the thought of being so average,

I don't know what to do - Really, no \*\*\*\*ing idea how to get through this, at first I told myself it's just a phase and it'll pass, it doesn't.

I mostly believe in trusting the process, but there is no process.

What should I do??",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. the individual expresses a lack of support in their relationship, indicating a significant emotional void. the desire to travel, shop, and have fun contrasts sharply with their current reality of financial strain and responsibility, highlighting unmet personal needs and aspirations. the mention of the boyfriend not working while the individual struggles with a demanding job adds to the sense of isolation and burden. the exploration of seeking arrangement suggests a desperate search for connection and support outside the current relationship. overall, the narrative is filled with indicators of loneliness, such as emotional neglect, unmet needs, and a yearning for a different, more fulfilling life."
"I Can??t Get Close With Anyone Anymore??I??ve had people come and go in my life so much in the past two years that I feel completely expendable. Various people (mainly my first serious relationship) have conditioned me to feel like any sort of true vulnerability will just push people away. The nail in the coffin was my brother??s recent suicide. I can??t explain it??but since then, it feels like there??s a wall between me and everyone else in my life. I have no energy to talk to any of my friends on a regular basis. I??m stretched too thin trying to foster deeper connections at college all while hiding the fact that I??m dealing with grief because, like I said people have made me feel like any sign of vulnerability (crying, opening up about struggles, etc.) will push people away. So, I no longer feel like my authentic self anywhere. I hang out with people at school passively, they only know me surface level. I don??t have anyone I feel like I can count on or be real with. I do know some would be there for me but at the very core I feel like I just don??t think they understand what I??m going through because I really don??t even know what it is??I feel like it??s all my fault that I feel this alone and crying only gives me temporary relief from the existential dread of everything.

"If I could go back in time, I would tell myselfIf I could go back in time, I would go up to my middle school-self and tell him ??Just go out and talk to them??. 

Idk why I couldn??t do it. I was intimidated by kids who were talking so excitedly in their own groups. I thought I would never be a part of them no matter how hard I try. I couldn??t open my mouth because I hated my voice. I was afraid of every second I was surrounded by other people. 

I was thinking about what I regret the most in my life, and this is the answer I think. I could have tried it anytime, but didn??t for two years. Not even once. I don??t know how it would have turned out, but every time I start thinking about the little boy who was sitting alone on an isolated chair where no one would look at, eating lunch all alone, barely swallowing any food because he was so self-conscious of people who were looking at him and talking behind his back. 

It already makes me embarrassed to think how I would tell my future spouse or children about those times. Even now I am totally clueless. Will I ever find any soulmates? Will any one love/like me the way I am? What if no one does? What if even I don??t like myself? Am I talking shitty about others because I myself am feeling worthless?

I don??t have any friends IRL aside from my boyfriend, and my immediate family. I am close with my parents and brother but they are 3,000+ miles away.

"I hate friends and yet still want themI don't know why I'm making this post.

Sorry if this is long, skip if you want to read something even remotely interesting.

I used to have friends. Kind of. Internet friends with whom I'd talk to nearly every second of every day. I don't know if I liked them much or if they even liked me at all, but it felt nice to have messages to wake up to.

I feel like I desperately want friends, but I also think I just want to stop feeling so sad. I don't even like people and I prefer to be alone. But I'm still lonely. Or maybe I just tell myself I don't like them because no one actually likes me lol. I know my family loves me, but I'm fairly certain even they don't actually ""like"" me. I don't socialize with anyone aside from them and it makes me feel lonely as hell. Then again, I was lonely even when I had a ""reliable"" internet friend group. I tried to get in touch with them recently, but everyone was older and different and didn't seem very interested.

I could go out or something. Maybe go to church, or get a job. Snatch up some friends and bazinga! Problem solved. But I'm pretty much incapable of actual socialization with real people (aside from my family, but it gets weird even with them) at this point. Like I'm just socially an absolute moron. I'm probably too stupid and immature to even handle a real job. I'm already 16 and I still feel like a toddler. I probably have the intellect of one.

But there's always the internet! I can text people and no one will know how socially inept I actually am! Ha, funny. I don't know how to make friends like I did when I was but a wee child. Now I just put up this persona and act like an uninterested asshole no one would want to hold a conversation with for longer than a minute. I start acting like the exact kind of people who I dislike speaking with and it feels like it's not even a choice. The way I'm typing right now doesn't even feel genuine, but at least it's not like ""bruhh k whatever ????????????????????????????????????????????????""

But I'm so so lonely. I can ignore it sometimes, but then there are nights like this when it feels like I'm going to implode.

"Just went on a lonely nighttime get away with myselfWent out at 1am to drop a small bag of donations off. Then I drove around with the roads all to myself and stopped at a nearby park with a huge hill where you can watch the city skyline twinkle in the distance from the top.

It was nice, but I really wish I had someone to join me on nights like this",1,"the narrative describes an individual's solitary nighttime outing, which includes activities like dropping off donations, driving alone, and sitting on a hill to watch the city skyline. the choice of words such as ""lonely nighttime get away"" and ""feeling somber"" indicate a sense of isolation and melancholy. the narrator's reflection on wishing for companionship during these moments further underscores feelings of loneliness. the combination of engaging in activities alone and the expressed desire for someone to share these experiences are clear indicators of loneliness. this longing for social connection amidst solitary enjoyment is a common psychological marker of loneliness."

"Tips to stop fantasizing about anyone that shows me attention?It's ridiculous how fast my brain starts to idealize people after I talk for two minutes with them.

I don??t like to say this with my own mouth because it sounds like I??m trying to make myself look good but I??ll say it. I am kind and caring. Two words that I used to look up and aspired to be but now feel like shackles and I??d rather be selfish and feel less. 

I am in no means trying to make myself look good, I??m just trying to paint the picture so please do stay if it doesn??t get too obnoxious.

I am in a sense kind. To me the kindest people in the world are those who do things even if they don??t want to. Let??s say there is a chair on the bus and someone stands up to give it to someone else. A person who doesn??t mind is kind but to me the kinder person is the one who really doesn??t want to but still does it. 
I am often in the middle. I take joy in knowing I am helping or making someone??s day better. I go out of my way to smile and treat people respectfully hoping to myself that these small acts will make someone??s day a bit better. 

But true kindness is doing things that wouldn??t be rewarded they say. 

I don??t expect lavish gifts or rewards for my actions but I do hope that whomever would at least be a bit grateful for me going out of my way to do something for someone even if I don??t really feel like it. And to strangers it??s all the same. I??m just hoping they may be a bit happier. 
But to friends and family? 

I go out of my way to stretch myself thin so as to be of help to my loved ones. For instances my family. I live far away from home, my family although is kinda financially stable it sure could see some better days. I work two jobs and ask no support from my parents. They say they??d send me some but I tell them to do so when we get more stable. I take care of the housework and try to help my brother in anyway. (I live with my older brother who although a good human being isn??t really a responsible person.) to be honest I came here for college so I could ease my parents worries about my brother who was living alone. I got into the third best university in korea to make my family proud. I try so hard to maintain a good appearance so that I could be a friend and family member to be proud of. 
I??d make time in a very busy schedule to hang out with friends and give them the attention, time, and effort. 
Example, it was my friends birthday. I had work in the morning and a test the next day but I just crammed as much study time the week before just to make time to properly be able to celebrate her birthday.
There are many more instances like these. With my aunt, with coworkers, etc. 
And in the end of the day I sit back and hope that they will appreciate my efforts.
But my birthday was on the 22nd my aunt whom I time and time again helped when she was in a pinch asked me to work an 9 hour shift when she tells me all the time how wonderful of a boss she is and how, when her other workers have birthdays she gives them a day off. But I who was there from the day she opened her business, was there to help her settle, I who crashed my health hoping that it would be easier for her, I who by the simple fact that I love my aunt would work 6-7 days a week so she could settle down, gets a worse treatment than a part timer who started a month back?? The same goes for my family and friends. All I got is a text of ??happy birthday.?? 
I know that I in sense am not kind if I expect a sort of reward. But today I got an angry call from my mother saying ??oh? So now that you are 20 you think your so grown up? You think that now that you are an adult you can do whatever you want?!??
And the answer is no. I am a child who craves love and recognition. I lay at night and cry myself to sleep because I am tired. So so very tired. I was thrown to adulthood and I am trying to do my best but things just slip by my fingers and I am sad how I am at the flower of my youth and I am wasting it away. 
I think I??m depressed to be honest. I??ve been like this for the longest time, probably middle school. But I just want someone who appreciates the small and big things that I do. Someone who I am enough for. 
Someone to tell me that I??m doing good and that they are proud of my accomplishments. 
I just want to be loved. I have many friends and a wonderful family. 
But I have no one who looks at me. Like really looks at me. I am not the happy, pretty girl I show everyone. I study late into nights to get good grades. I work endless hours to support my brother and I. I work so so hard to be as attractive as I can be. And all for who? All for what? 
I guess this is all just angsty 20 year old talk but even if my brain understands that I might be being stupid the fact that I feel so empty and sad does not change. 
Does anyone else feel this way? Do you need me to listen to you just like you read through my ginormous monologue? Maybe we can hear each other and make ourselves a little less lonely? 
I don??t know all I want to say is thank you for reading this helluva of a long rant. I hope that for as sad as I am you the reader is as happy. 
Hoping the New Years is going to be a new start for all of us. 
Please be happy. And one last time thank you.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional exhaustion despite the presence of friends and family. the author expresses a longing for genuine appreciation and recognition, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the mention of crying themselves to sleep and feeling depressed highlights their emotional distress. the author’s efforts to maintain a good appearance and be kind to others, even at the expense of their own well-being, suggest a lack of reciprocation and support from their social circle. this imbalance, where they give much but receive little in return, exacerbates their feelings of loneliness. the plea for someone to truly see and appreciate them underscores their desire for meaningful connections and validation. the narrative also reflects a struggle with the transition to adulthood and the associated responsibilities, further contributing to their sense of isolation and longing for support. overall, the narrative captures the essence of loneliness through the author's heartfelt expression of unmet emotional needs and the burdens they carry alone."
"I feel like I'm nosediving.I've always been alone. I'm 26, I've never been on a date, I've never been to a party, I only really have one real friend, but usually those things don't bother me a whole lot. I've got hobbies and such to keep myself busy. There have been rough patches, sure, but I'd say I've been OK most of the time.

The past two weeks though, I've been feeling just endlessly, soul-crushingly depressed about all that. I don't think I've ever wanted companionship as badly as I have in the past few days. I've cried over it, I've lost sleep over it, I can't focus on anything, it's just been gnawing at my brain nonstop 24/7 and I can't make it go away. I just want someone to invite me somewhere or a cute girl to message me on OKCupid and actually stick around instead of ghosting me. I can't tell you how badly I want it, it's such a deep, visceral want that I can almost physically feel it. I feel like my brain is slowly melting.

I just can't do this anymore. I've been telling myself for fucking years and years basically ""2012 is going to be the year! OK, 2012 didn't work, that means 2013! Alright, 2014. 2015? 2016? Please?"", and every year I'm slightly less successful and more and more lonely. How much longer do I have to do this? Am I going to be 36 thinking ""2032, maybe?""

So here's my plan, I'm giving myself the rest of 2021 to see if I can end the lifelong loneliness. If that doesn't work, if 2022 rolls around and I'm still alone, then I'm just ending it. I'm not doing another year of this, there's nothing anyone can say that can convince me to change my mind. I'm so tired.",1,"the narrative vividly illustrates the deep sense of isolation and yearning for companionship that the individual is experiencing. despite having hobbies and a friend, the person describes a pervasive and escalating sense of loneliness that has recently intensified to a soul-crushing level. the narrative highlights the absence of romantic and social experiences, such as never having been on a date or to a party, which are common indicators of loneliness. the person's desperation is palpable, as they express a visceral longing for connection and the emotional toll it has taken, including crying, insomnia, and an inability to focus. the repeated annual hope for change, followed by disappointment, underscores a chronic pattern of loneliness that has led to a profound sense of hopelessness and a contemplation of ending their life if the situation does not improve. these elements collectively point to a severe experience of loneliness, marked by a deep emotional pain and a critical need for social connection and support."
"No one ever reaches out to meI never get any texts, no one invites me anywhere, I feel like everyone's a fake friend. Whenever I try to initiate texting/hanging out, usually it just turns into small talk or nothing pretty quickly. I just want people to talk to, who are close to me. I tried meeting new people but for some reason I find it hard to make friends, probably because I'm way more serious than the average person at my age (15). The friends I already have are really fun to talk to, I just wish we did that more often. I don't wanna go and tell them that I need more attention, because 1. Who does that and 2. It seems too needy and ego, and I feel like they aren't enjoying the conversation, and just trying to be nice to me so that I feel better. I just wish they were honest.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a lack of social interaction and meaningful connections, noting that no one reaches out to them and that their attempts to initiate contact often result in superficial exchanges or are ignored. this sense of social isolation is compounded by feelings of being surrounded by ""fake friends"" and a perception that their current friends do not genuinely enjoy their company. the desire for closer, more frequent interactions and the difficulty in forming new friendships suggest a deep yearning for meaningful relationships. additionally, the individual's reluctance to communicate their need for attention due to fear of appearing needy or egotistical highlights a significant emotional struggle. these elements collectively point to an experience of loneliness, characterized by a lack of satisfying social bonds and a sense of disconnection from others."

It??s so hard for me to tell anyone because I feel like a burden, but I??ve been so bad that I have. But I receive no response. Two weeks ago I asked if anyone could receive me in their home because I had tried to kill myself in mine (and my mom just got angry at me so I needed some support) and no answer.

I'm undesirable. In every sense of the word. I have way too much emotional baggage. I don't even have the intellect to justify that now though ever since I low key murdered my braincells with drugs and alcohol and I continue to do so. 

I left my ex five months ago? I don't miss her, but I almost miss being with someone. At least having enough physical contact as a human. I don't get that now. That's what I miss though.

I can't seem to find a reason why someone could have any feelings for me. I'm fucking ugly, for one, and now that my personality has been reduced to just the druggie, I haven't got much going for me I suppose.

Humans are social creatures, as much as I wish that wasn't true I'm afraid it's written in our biology. I just wish I didn't crave something can't have.

LonelyI??ve been feeling like this recently when I??m by myself in my room. I haven??t really had friends for a couple of years I talk mostly to family nieces and nephews and sisters but I still feel lonely that I have no one my age to talk about my interests like anime KDramas or random things. I like listening to podcasts when there is a group of people because it helps wit the feeling. I??m 26 but I don??t really party or anything I just work and go home. Since I work for my family I don??t really meet new people. I cry when I??m driving home at night because I catch myself have full blown conversation with myself.

I (24M) feel awful and heartbroken tonight. One of my few good friends (24F, totally platonic) has recently stopped responding to me for reasons I can??t identify. It was her birthday yesterday, I sent a message wishing her a happy birthday and still nothing. I??m really anxious and heartbroken from this.

Everyone tells me that I??m smart, I??m charming, I??m funny, but so few people seem to actually give a shit about me. I??ve never been in a relationship before. I know this shouldn??t be a big deal but it??s always been a big source of sadness, embarrassment, and confusion for me. I think I??m deserving of love and affection, and I think I afford that to others, but don??t understand why people don??t feel the same about me. 

I went to the club tonight (alone, as always) because apparently that??s what young people are supposed to do. As usual, I left after a couple hours, frustrated and confused because I don??t know what to do around all those strangers.

"3 AM. Intrusive thoughts and anxiety are ruining my lifeI've been thinking a lot recently. Last night I spent a few hours with ny twi childhood friends. The conversation seemed forced as long as I was contributing to it, and the embarrassment that I felt for even saying anything at all was overwhelming. I ended up sitting in silence for 75% of the time, ruminating over my own ineptitude for social interaction even around the closest friends I've ever had!

I am trying so hard. It's difficult to interact with people because I feel like I am constantly analyzing my past experiences and planning for every next interaction.

"I just want a friend that I can invite to my house and feel safe and comfortable with, but it just feels like it would be beyond impossibleI'll list a few reasons:

I'm fat and ugly. I bet everyone hates me for it. 

I also have bad hygiene. I don't think it's caused by depression, I've always had it. I just smell bad 24/7.

I'm depressed and I have anxiety. Yay. I just have no motivation to do anything, and when I do for example complete a school assignment, I get extremely anxious over returning it and end up just sitting there crying my eyes our because I'll never do anything productive. Imagine having to care for a person that does something like that.

I just am not good at conversations. I can't start one, but when it starts, I can't end it. When I'm at a conversation with someone that isn't too familiar to me, it becomes awkward easily. Sometimes I even can't speak properly because of anxiety.

These are just a few of the reasons of why I hate myself. As you guessed, I'm not the best friend out there. And making friends... I'm not good at it either. And now into the inviting to my house part: I haven't done so in over five years, which is a lot considering my age (14). I haven't visited my friends for a long time either, except for once last year, but it lasted for just two hours.
 I'm too insecure to invite anyone near me, especially if I know they'll be looking at my face or any other part of my body.

"Sometimes you just wake upSometimes you just wake up and feel terribly lonely, full of fatigue, exhausted instead of feeling rested; that feeling when you just want to give up whatever you're doing and do nothing, immerse in the static that envelopes you, just stay in bed and wallow in sorrow, wallow in solitude. Especially now during this ever-lasting pandemic of which I don't see any end to, everyday seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours, and hours feel like days, and days feel like a week and so on. Sometimes you just wake up and feel terribly bad. I know it might sound very clich??, I'm sure you've read something similar a thousand times but it doesn't make it any less true. I just want to give up but this human trait of mine of not giving up, of hoping, of perpetual wishful thinking that all these things that I'm doing right now is for the better future, this human trait is there, so strong that sometimes it's uncontrollable. I know there's better to come, but when and why do I have to wait for it? If not now, when? And why?

"LonelyI??m 23 and tired. I??ve been single for a few months and it sucks. The relationship wasn??t actually that great and was 100% taken advantage of but I could lie to myself a bit at least. Now I??m just lonely.

Growing up I had a lot of trauma and issues with education that made making friends next to impossible. Now that I??m older I??m one emotionally under developed ass that gets it wrong at least 90% of the time.

I really hate that I always feel this alone and that I??ve pretty much given up on anything resembling a relationship, even my ex didn??t want anything physical and there was 0 passion I just tried to lift them up when they felt down and tried to be their for them and their family. I spent a lot of money even though I??m literally poor and spent so much time working on making them or someone close to them feel good but I wasn??t enough. 

I??m no prize when it comes to looks (in fact I??m more of a punishment) but I??m also not a crazy incel so if no one (and at this point it is no one) is attracted to me then that??s their right and cool. That said, I am sick of being the friend no one wants, someone who follows the group, not having someone who can make me feel wanted and the general expectation that I??m inherently not a viable love interest/option because of how I look. People laugh at the idea including friends eve if not to my face. For context I??m a lesbian (lowering possible partners) and I??m tran, which makes it even harder. At this point I have genuinely given up on a real relationship, I told a friend I liked her (not expecting anything to come of it cos she??s 1) straight and 2) in a relationship.

"The Living DeadIf you've been living like me for the past 14 years in a life with no substance, with no goals or enthusiam you are dead but living, your brain keeps the body alive or you keep it by eating food and sleeping but you are dead.That's what i've discovered about myself.

In 2007 i went to highschool and that's where i couldn't keep up with the world.Couldn't make friends with anyone and played videos games most of the time. Everyone ignored me i was invisible, a ghost, you know what a ghost is also? it's dead. Evers since highschool ended i have been living on autopilot with video games, porn and movies. I have died in 2007 and that is the truth, what mattered most died in 2007.

Now in 2021 i'm still on autopilot,what changed is i have a job working 3 years now job that i've gotten in 2018 but it's very low payout so it's like not a job at all - no decent money = no decent life. There are no people in my life and you know why? dead people have no friends the living dead have no friends or lovers they're just dead.

I need people that say that they are there for me and truly mean what they say. Someone who I can trust my life with. But I know these people are rare, so I'm losing hope of ever finding them.

I think I'm open to the idea of being abused if someone will be there for me. It seems insane but I have no one to count on. I dont ja e an emergency contact at work even. I'm so sad. Im not gay but I really think I'd be open to it if it meant someone would just hug me and show interest in my life. 

This isnt a contest but I dont think most people understand this level of social isolation. I cant be alone forever. I just want someone next to me in bed or in the bedroom next to mine.

"Raised to be lonelyPast couple of days I've thought about a lot where my life has been, where it came from and where I might be. I'm 29 and on the verge of hitting 30 in the next 5 months. Growing up i never realized how lonely and alone I was when I was a kid, i think it was because has kids we all had those blinders of ""ignorance is bless."" I was an only child believe it not the only ONLY child in my entire family (everyone else has had 2+ more kids). So I've always felt and been like the black sheep of my family. I came from a strict household family from old school European values, not that it was bad because its how i learned to be respectful and the decent person I am today. But, I was definitely a sheltered child. Never really hung out with friends or had a sleepover or been to one or gone to camp or experience anything friend related i think until 14 maybe even 15. I've always kept to myself and just stuck to my hobbies and just overall enjoyed being by myself. Learned a lot about morals and values through my favorite 90s TV shows and some good books I've read. Fast forward through my adult life and I've been through a lot as well! I've been married, gotten divorced, lost touch with a lot of people (mainly because of found relationships or paths going different ways), experience deaths in my family. You know all the things people can relate to! I think the biggest thing to happen to me so far is my failed marriage and relationship that happened about 5 years ago. You never realize how alone you really are until its literally just you again! As a gamer I always said ""I hit the reset button on my life"" and it was literally just that because i had no idea what was going to happen or where to even begin with anything and everything. Again fast forward today, I never realized how much ive actually been alone as a kid and how much ive actually been use to it that its something that shouldn't bother me because I was raised like that. I've always had more pressure or treated differently by my parents because well i was their only child and they just expected a lot from their own child. I love my parents, they're great individuals and im not sure where I'd be without them today. You know it definitely is the little things in life that makes you realize being lonely or alone isn't bad when you break everything down in a list. When i made my list I actually found that my pros heavily out weighted my cons completely. But, because I went through that adult phase, that experience of being in love and being with someone you spent most of your adulthood from 18-25 and then it just be gone like that i think thats what got me the most. Its alright to be alone, its OK to feel lonely as well, im human and I know once in a blue moon all those feelings will come back and hit me like a ton of bricks but I'm grateful for what I have, for who I am as a person, and for what I can do. The only real thing missing in my life really is a relationship, a partner crime, my missing puzzle piece! But I realize if I do end up alone or by myself for the remainder of my life, that would be alright to because my life has meaning in a lot of my branches in my tree of life and I shouldn't let one little dead branch corrupt all the ones that keep growing and bloom each year around!

Sorry for the long rant! ???? hope whoever gets through it all enjoyed it, if not well that's alright too.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep and ongoing sense of isolation and loneliness that has permeated the author's life from childhood into adulthood. growing up as an only child in a strict household with old school values, the author experienced a sheltered upbringing with limited social interactions, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the lack of childhood experiences with friends, sleepovers, or camps contributed to a sense of being different or the ""black sheep"" of the family. the author acknowledges having been through significant life events, such as marriage and divorce, and losing touch with people, which further amplified their feelings of loneliness. the metaphor of ""hitting the reset button"" on life after the failed marriage underscores the abrupt return to solitude and the struggle to navigate life alone. while the author attempts to find solace in their independence and the positives in their life, the recurring theme of longing for a meaningful relationship and the admission of feeling lonely at times indicate a deep-seated sense of loneliness. the narrative reveals an ongoing internal conflict between accepting solitude and yearning for companionship, highlighting the complex nature of loneliness."

My cat died and my loneliness is reaching the sky[deleted],1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of loss and emotional pain due to the death of the cat, which is explicitly linked to an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. the phrase ""my loneliness is reaching the sky"" suggests an intensification of these feelings, indicating that the cat may have been a significant source of companionship and emotional support. this kind of attachment to a pet is common among individuals who experience loneliness, as pets often serve as a substitute for human connection and provide a sense of purpose and comfort. the expression of such intense loneliness following the loss of the pet highlights the deep emotional void and the absence of other meaningful social relationships in the individual's life. this context and the emotional language used are clear indicators of loneliness."

I've lived through almost a third of my entire life without ever experiencing anything resembling intimacy with another human being, never held hands, never been on a date, let alone kissed. I'm haunted by the fact that whenever, if ever, I'll get to have this kind of interactions with someone I, a fully grown adult, will have to explain to them that i don't know what I'm doing. That I've never even given one kiss in my entire existence.

The lowest have been the opposite, when I isolate myself and withdraw from friendships.

Ultimately I think what's eating at me is a denial of self. My heart naturally wants to give and love others, but all it takes is a thought reminder of how I've gotten hurt in the past to keep me doing nothing. My mind will try to make me feel better by telling me I don't need anyone to be happy. Like, there were yogis that would stay in a cave for years and find eternal peace within. If they can do it, so can I, right? I'm realizing the isolation path is like doing life on hard mode, there are far easier ways to be happy again, and all it really takes is putting myself out there without fear of rejection in order to build the support systems I need to get through the hard times.

No one is perfect, and we don't have to wait to become perfect before we try to make real connections with others. There will inevitably be mistakes made and heartaches. But with that should come all the lessons learned and fearlessness to do it all again. We're all [perfectly broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCjgaOKrwRA) and it's okay. Take care everyone.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness stemming from a significant life event, the end of a relationship a year ago. the author describes experiencing waves of loneliness and the steady onset of anxiety and depression, which are common psychological responses to prolonged isolation and lack of human connection. the reflection on happier times surrounded by caring people versus the lowest points of self-isolation highlights the importance of social bonds in their emotional well-being. the mention of a ""denial of self"" suggests an internal conflict where their natural inclination to connect with others is hindered by past hurts and fear of rejection. the attempt to rationalize loneliness by comparing themselves to isolated yogis indicates a struggle to find solace in solitude, which ultimately feels unnatural and challenging. the realization that isolation makes life harder and the recognition of the need to build support systems underscores the critical role of social interaction in overcoming loneliness. the narrative's conclusion, embracing imperfection and the necessity of making connections despite potential heartaches, reveals a hopeful yet poignant understanding of their loneliness and the path forward."
"It feels like everything is going backwards and stagnated.In the past few months, I made a commitment to myself to take care of myself more, to actually for the first ever, love myself as a whole. I thought I was going so well then those ominious voices started to crawl. ""You're not good enough."", ""They say they like you to not make you feel bad."", ""You're useless and embarrassing."", etc. Now, my friends ignore all of my messages for 12-15 hours. I received no messages from no one. I'm starting to think that my best friend is hating on me. I really don't know what to do.

I've tried to cut myself, overdose myself, etc. It's not working.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and self-doubt. the individual's commitment to self-care and self-love is overshadowed by intrusive negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy. the mention of friends ignoring messages for extended periods exacerbates the sense of being unwanted and disconnected. the belief that even a best friend might harbor negative feelings towards them intensifies the loneliness. the repeated attempts at self-harm and thoughts of suicide are alarming indicators of severe emotional distress and a profound sense of hopelessness. these elements collectively suggest a strong experience of loneliness, marked by both social isolation and a lack of self-worth."

"Feelings for my ""best friend""I say ""best friend"" because he's literally only person I can kinda call a friend, we're really close during school but never contact otherwise. I feel like I love him but I know this isn't the case as it has happened before with other person I called a friend and I got over her in 2 years. I keep thinking about him before bed and stuff, as you do. I could technically ask him out and he would probably give it a try but he'd just semi like me and I'd realize I don't love him in a week and it would be a mess and I'd lose the only person willing to talk to me who also isn't a total shithead and has something in common. If he said no I'd lose whatever shred of confidence I have in my looks and feel even more pathetic granted I've fallen for only 2 people who gave me a shred of attention. The way I feel might be a little obsessive? I wanna be with him I want him to hold me I wanna open up with him but I know that's just the character I've created and he acts different irl. I'm 16f, kinda attractive but my style Is polarizing and literally nobody has ever expressed any interest platonic or romantic towards me and I know its because of my personality, I'm terrified of people but I also look very unapproachable. This was a mess but like getting it off my chest and I doubt anyone will read this",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for connection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author describes having only one person they can call a friend, and even that relationship is limited to school interactions without any contact outside of that environment. the intense feelings towards this friend, despite recognizing a pattern of similar feelings in the past, suggest a yearning for emotional closeness and acceptance. the fear of losing this sole connection if things were to go wrong highlights a significant anxiety about being left completely alone. the author's self-perception, mentioning their polarizing style and unapproachable demeanor, further reinforces their feelings of being misunderstood and disconnected from others. the mention of being terrified of people and the lack of expressed interest from others, both platonic and romantic, underscores a pervasive sense of social isolation. overall, the narrative is filled with expressions of longing, fear of rejection, and a struggle to connect with others, all of which are key indicators of loneliness."

"I wish Snapchat would stop suggesting to try different filters with a friend.More sad reminders of my eternal loneliness. 
Thanks Snapchat!",1,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and sadness triggered by snapchat's suggestions to try filters with friends. the phrase ""more sad reminders of my eternal loneliness"" is a clear indicator of the author's feelings of isolation and lack of social connections. this explicit mention of loneliness, coupled with the sarcastic ""thanks snapchat!"" at the end, highlights the author's emotional pain and sense of being left out. such expressions are typical of individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often feel a heightened awareness of their social deficits and may react negatively to reminders of social activities they are not part of. this narrative aligns with common psychological insights where individuals suffering from loneliness are more sensitive to social cues that emphasize their solitude."

"Don??t listen to people with cliche answers on how to lead a better lifeNobody is going to approach you because they barely acknowledge your existence. The only possible reason people care about you is because there scared that if you die it would hurt them so they don??t care deep down about how you really feel nor do they want to try to care they just tell you not to end it. No girl/boy is going to approach you and ask you out because most of us are losers who can??t get anyone because we don??t look like the 1% who get asked to take pictures and go to parties and have the time of their lives whilst we stay at home wanting to die.

There is no change anywhere and it doesn??t exist. We were all born to be like this and the same things keep happening over and over to prevent us from breaking free from loneliness. Take me for example, last year I met a girl she was nice and I got out of my shell for her. She was actually leading me on and using me so she could get close to my friend. They??re together now, still. This year I had it with my loneliness and decided to join a society, I email this particular society and I get an email from the boyfriend of the girl I liked thanking me for joining the society. Some absolute bullshit but that??s just how it works.

"I had a friendship with someone I met online and since it ended earlier this year Ive had a hole in me
Around a year ago I was in a really rough place. I felt very alone, and I also felt like a failure and a hypocrite. Despite these feeling I had a fairly ok social life. I would go out and spend time with friends but I always felt a disconnect from them. I would hangout with them but we never felt ""close"". I talked to a few people I had met online from posting on reddit and that was nice but I still felt very alone. 

Then I met ""L"". I really didn't even expect a friendship to happen, we were both pretty awkward but we were real with each other so we ended up continuing to talk. Our conversations were about things we cared about or even just random musings. We would share memes, watch tv shows together, and stay up late into the night just hanging out with each other. 

For the first time in a long time I could really bear my soul with someone. I have a lot of bottled up issues. Self esteem issues, confidence issues, loneliness, mild mental health issues (Mild depression/anxiety/adhd). We talked about these things as she had some similar issues. Neither of us had to hide who we were from each other and it was really nice. We could share our faults with each other and not feel judged, we could be honest about our loneliness without being judged, and we could comfort each other. Despite only knowing each other online we got to know each other quite well through skype calls. 

As time went on an attraction grew, we started to flirt some and I'm not going to go into details but there were a few moments of online passion. What was amazing about that is we could still be ourselves. I wanted to please her, and she wanted to please me, and we were both open about it. If one of us needed comfort the other wanted to give it. It was a deeply refreshing experience to not only have someone who wanted to comfort me when I was feeling sad but also who wanted me to comfort them when they were sad. 

Eventually though we started to drift apart, we had different goals in life and our short 5-8 month romance had more or less run its course. It wasn't all perfect, she was a good 6 years younger than me (i'm 27) and that created a strain at times because I thought she had a lot of co-dependence with her parents who I also think abused her (not physically but emotionally). She could also be quite naive at times. I wasn't always the most understanding, I wanted her to act like someone my age when she frankly wasn't, and I only am who I am now cause I was immature as a 21 year old as well. 

So It ended, and now for months and months Ive had this empty hole in me because I miss it. I miss her but I understand why it ended and why it needed to but I miss having someone I could be that vulnerable with.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness despite the presence of social interactions. the author describes a period of significant emotional struggle and a feeling of disconnect from their in-person friends. the friendship with ""l"" provided a unique sense of connection and emotional intimacy that the author had been lacking. the detailed recounting of their conversations, shared activities, and mutual support highlights how this relationship temporarily filled the emotional void. however, the ending of this relationship has left the author with a renewed and deepened sense of emptiness and longing for that level of closeness and understanding. the author’s reflections on their own issues and the specific mention of feeling lonely even in the company of others are typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative's focus on the emotional impact of losing this significant connection further underscores the author’s ongoing experience of loneliness."

I??m 26 yo and I??ve got no experience in dating, in sex, in having someone and taking care of that someone. I??m just... lonely.
And scared.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and frustration with the difficulty of finding acceptance and love. the individual repeatedly mentions feeling lonely and scared, emphasizing their lack of experience in relationships and the fear that accompanies it. the description of being treated like a child and ignored by women highlights feelings of inadequacy and rejection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the person's self-awareness of their loneliness and the emotional pain it causes are clear signs of their struggle with social connection and intimate relationships."
"Nobody would really even notice if I wasn??t there anymoreI??ve posted before about being the background friend, and my current situation has really just confirmed it. My roommate is breaking her lease and moving out, leaving me responsible for her half of the rent and other living expenses. I prepaid everything upfront with my federal grants as a grad student. With her moving out, and me being a full time student with little to no income, I??m facing eviction and homelessness. 

I??ve tried reaching out to talk to people to I go to for support, and it??s clear the subject has made them uncomfortable because all I get in return is ??oh that sucks I??m sorry.?? And then they just stop responding. I??ve spent the last two weeks trying to apply to everything I can find, finding food pantries, trying to negotiate bills, asking people I trust to take care of my pets when I get evicted. But it??s become so very painfully clear that help is just not coming. I am alone and I??ll very shortly be alone and homeless during December in the Midwest. 

I??m exhausted. I haven??t slept in days, I haven??t really eaten either. I??m trying to make anything my cats/dog could eat lasts as long as possible so at the very least they aren??t going hungry. I??m so fucking tired of keeping it all inside and putting on a fake ass smile when I really feel like I??m going to collapse at any moment. I don??t have anywhere to go, or anyone to talk to about what I??m feeling right now except for a bunch of random strangers on the internet, and I have never felt so alone.",1,"the narrative vividly describes an overwhelming sense of isolation and abandonment. the author feels unnoticed and unimportant, as evidenced by their belief that nobody would notice their absence. the situation with their roommate exacerbates these feelings, leading to financial strain and the imminent threat of eviction and homelessness. despite efforts to seek support, the responses from others are minimal and dismissive, deepening the sense of isolation. the lack of meaningful connections and support is highlighted by the author’s reliance on random strangers on the internet for emotional expression. physical symptoms of loneliness, such as exhaustion, insomnia, and lack of appetite, further illustrate the depth of their emotional distress. the narrative is a poignant depiction of the author's profound loneliness and their struggle to cope with the overwhelming circumstances they face."
"I hate myself, i'm so alone[removed]",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of self-loathing and isolation, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the explicit statement ""i hate myself"" suggests a significant level of negative self-perception, often associated with feelings of worthlessness and depression. this self-directed negativity can lead to or exacerbate social withdrawal, as individuals may believe they are unworthy of companionship or support. additionally, the phrase ""i am so alone"" directly conveys the individual's experience of loneliness, highlighting a lack of meaningful social connections or support systems. these expressions are classic signs of someone struggling with loneliness, as they reflect both emotional distress and a perceived absence of relational bonds. the intensity of these feelings, as expressed in the narrative, underscores the profound impact loneliness can have on mental health."
"Struggles of a realist who dreams like an idealistI dont care about having lots of friends, what I want is someone who really knows me, who I am fully comfortable with, and will put me first like I will put them first. It dosent even have to be romantic.

When I see fictional couples or friendships it makes my heart ache because I want that deep connection with somebody. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that real people just arent made that way. We're too selfish and no one can truly understand anyone else. What I want is a soulmate but there is no such thing. 

Most of my friendships have been pretty one-sided, with me really caring and them taking me for granted and treating me like crap and I've never actually had a romantic relationship. Probably my own fault but at this point I dont see why I would bother. I've kind of given up on other people I guess. 

Thanks for reading, it's nice to have somewhere I can vent.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep yearning for a meaningful and reciprocal connection, highlighting a significant emotional gap in the author's life. the individual expresses a sense of disillusionment with real-world relationships, feeling that people are inherently too selfish to form the kind of deep, understanding bond they crave. the mention of fictional relationships causing heartache indicates a longing for an idealized connection that seems unattainable in reality. the repeated experiences of one-sided friendships and the lack of romantic relationships contribute to feelings of being undervalued and misunderstood. this pervasive sense of isolation and the conclusion that genuine connections are impossible suggest a profound experience of loneliness. the narrative also conveys a sense of resignation and hopelessness, as the individual has ""kind of given up on other people,"" further underscoring their emotional solitude. the act of venting in this context appears to be a coping mechanism for the loneliness they are enduring."
So lonely I talk dirty to strangers online for validation ????????????????It sucks. It sucks so freaking badly.,1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loneliness through the explicit admission of engaging in online interactions for validation. the use of phrases like ""so lonely"" and ""it sucks so freaking badly"" highlights a deep emotional distress and dissatisfaction with their current state. seeking validation from strangers, especially in a manner that involves talking dirty, suggests a desperate attempt to fill a void and connect with others, even if the connection is superficial and fleeting. this behavior is often a coping mechanism for those experiencing loneliness, as it provides temporary relief from feelings of isolation. the intensity of the language used further underscores the severity of the individual's emotional pain and their struggle to find meaningful, fulfilling relationships."
"The unbreakable structure.
I don't understand what's wrong with me. I've tried everything I can to be lovable, everything, but still... still I haven't found someone.

"I wish I knew how to feel attachmentSo many people are lonely because of rejection. Or they miss that one somebody. Or perhaps they just don??t have the guts to talk to that *one somebody*. 

But damn. I just don??t know how to feel anymore. I can??t love platonically, much less romantically. 

I am disposable to everyone. I usually befriend the ??outcasts??. It??s normally a one way street: They talk of their problems. I help them out. I??m still a mysterious figure to them. If I do share anything personal, it??s usually with no emotion. I just state my burdens stoically, as facts. Once they find their niche, they bid farewell to me for good. No hard feelings. No bad blood. I was just their jumpstart. I have no emotional attachment to them. They still acknowledge me, but it??s nothing more than routine. Then they stop even acknowledging me. 

I so painfully long to feel something about this all. I want to be able to talk candidly about my life. But my reality is far too much for anyone. How can I talk about the weather and sports when depression and ptsd constantly scrape my mind utterly raw? How can I care about what I wear, when I??m working my ass off just to stay afloat and keep my mouth shut? How can I desire any form of intimacy without harboring constant terror of being taken advantage of? Slandered? Attacked? Raped? I don??t know how to fucking love anymore. I can??t. I want to so badly, but the best I can do is indifferent. Indifferent? Is that what someone wants in a friend? My abrasive unlikableness doesn??t help either. Indifferent is as positive as I can feel, but there is plenty worse to be seen. I rarely smile. Not because I??m a *BaD AsS*, but because smiling gets you nothing but motherfucking trauma. Plus, smiling is a pain when you feel nothing of the sort. It kind of disgusts me, when people smile all the time. Even when they??re being an absolute bitch. If you??re gonna be a bitch, be a straight up bitch, no need to be two-faces about it. Oddly enough, usually, the only times I smile outside the confines of my house are when I??m in severe psychological pain. I call it the Overcompensation Station ^TM .

I dream, sometimes, of finding someone (which is the most ridiculously far-fetched thing I??ve ever heard), but those thoughts usually turn sour. I??ve given up on the dream of changing. It??s going on 4 years now. 4 damn years filled with therapy and psychiatrists and medicines and coping skills. And I still want to die. Something is so broken inside me, severed even, I don??t think I??ll ever be able to be normal again. ??But, coffeenpills, normal is a relative term,?? they say. Shut the fuck up. Just stop. I??m in the slimmest percent of so many things. I??ve had a psychiatrist tell me they??ve never met a fucking patient like me before. Another said that I should fix *myself*. I??m the broken of the broken. The outcast of outcasts. The laughing stock of the abused jesters. And I wish I could cease. 

TL;DR: I fucking hate myself.",1,"the narrative reveals profound emotional distress and a deep sense of disconnection from others. the author expresses an inability to form attachments and a pervasive sense of being disposable to everyone they encounter. they describe a pattern of helping others without forming meaningful bonds, feeling like a ""mysterious figure"" who is ultimately left behind. the narrative is filled with expressions of longing for emotional connection and the pain of not being able to achieve it. the author’s references to depression, ptsd, and a constant struggle to stay afloat highlight significant psychological burdens. their self-description as ""indifferent"" and ""abrasive"" further underscores a sense of isolation and self-loathing. the narrative's raw honesty about their suffering and the failure of therapeutic interventions to bring relief emphasizes a profound and persistent loneliness."

Everyone abandons me.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and mistrust towards others, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual describes difficulty in forming new friendships and a recurring pattern of being abandoned or ghosted by people, which exacerbates their feelings of solitude. the phrase ""i've been alone for most of my life"" highlights a long-standing experience of loneliness, suggesting that this isn't a temporary state but a chronic issue. the expression of a desire to ""throw it all down and give up"" points to a deep emotional despair often associated with prolonged loneliness. the conviction that ""there is no one for me"" and ""everyone abandons me"" further emphasizes the person's belief in their own unworthiness of companionship, a common psychological insight in those who suffer from intense loneliness. these aspects collectively paint a picture of someone deeply entrenched in feelings of loneliness and social disconnection."
"Feeling alone in times of changeHey guys, just thought I'll write my recent thoughts down here. So although I am actually kinda extroverted and enjoy being with people my friend circle dispersed pretty hard since corona. It happened a few times before that friend circles kinda dispersed with everyone going their way and having new people while I always feel left alone. 

Right now I have some difficult times since I found out I hate my job and want to learn something new. I will look into 2 different professions in the next 2 weeks (so 2 internships). I'm kinda excited to see what it's like but I am also scared that if I don't like either of them I have no clue what to do. The only people I can share this with right now are my mom and a friend who is really inconsistent at answering messages or voice notes. 

Actually got an appointment and had my first session with a psychologist this week, but with the internships the next 2 weeks I will only meet her in 3 weeks again. Talking about such stuff felt pretty good and I am kinda sad that I won't be able to talk someone outside my little circle about this topic. 

Idk I just kinda wish I also had this group of people who you have consistent contact/meetups and can share such things. Right now I have to force myself to get outside my room so I don't feel completely miserable, but although I feel being outside is good for me its just not the same with always being alone. No matter if I take a walk, or ride my bycicle or whatever I just feel so isolated from the world while all I see outside are people being together. This really sucks right now.",1,"the narrative clearly reflects feelings of loneliness and isolation. the author mentions a dispersion of their friend circle since the pandemic, which has left them feeling alone. despite being extroverted and enjoying social interactions, they express a sense of abandonment as their friends have moved on to new circles while they remain behind. this is compounded by their current dissatisfaction with their job and the uncertainty about their future career path. the limited support system, consisting only of their mom and an inconsistent friend, exacerbates their sense of isolation. the author’s recent appointment with a psychologist provided some relief, but the infrequency of these sessions leaves them yearning for more consistent support. they express a desire for a stable group of friends with whom they can share their experiences and emotions. the need to force themselves to go outside to avoid feeling miserable, combined with the observation of others enjoying companionship, highlights their acute awareness of their own loneliness. these aspects are typical indicators of loneliness, characterized by a lack of meaningful social connections and the emotional distress that accompanies it."

This is why im lonely...",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and self-doubt, which are key indicators of loneliness. the writer describes their experience on the online platform as painful, comparing it to walking through a field of poisonous thorns. this metaphor suggests that while they find the content relatable, it also intensifies their feelings of loneliness. the repeated questioning of their own worth and the value of their contributions indicates a lack of self-esteem and a fear of rejection. phrases like ""nobody wants to read this"" and ""i should just delete this"" show a significant level of self-criticism and a belief that their presence is unwelcome. this internal dialogue, filled with hesitation and negativity, highlights a struggle with feelings of inadequacy and the desire for social connection that remains unfulfilled. the concluding statement, ""this is why im lonely,"" directly acknowledges their awareness of their loneliness, reinforcing the emotional distress and isolation they are experiencing. these elements combined paint a clear picture of someone grappling with loneliness and seeking validation and connection in a space where they feel invisible and unworthy."
STFU MY STUPID HEADWelp here I am lying in bed crying on and off and I just can??t take it. All I can hear is myself talking to me in my head. I have music on but can??t even listen to it. I just want to hear someone else??s voice but have no ones to hear. I fucking hate having adhd but then you mix loneliness with it and I just want to explode,1,"the narrative presents a vivid depiction of emotional distress and isolation. the individual describes lying in bed crying intermittently, indicating a state of emotional turmoil. the mention of ""talking to me in my head"" and the inability to listen to music suggest a struggle with intrusive thoughts and an inability to find distraction or comfort. the explicit desire to hear someone else's voice, coupled with the lament that there is ""no ones to hear,"" highlights a profound sense of social isolation. the frustration expressed towards having adhd, compounded by feelings of loneliness, underscores the overwhelming nature of their experience. these elements are characteristic indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a yearning for social connection and the pain of its absence."
anyone else feel terribly lonely but doesn??t even try to reach out and make friendsi feel really sad rn,1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loneliness through the expression of feeling ""terribly lonely"" and ""really sad."" the individual's admission of not trying to reach out or make friends indicates a possible sense of hopelessness or fear of rejection, which are common psychological barriers in lonely individuals. the use of ""anyone else"" suggests a longing for connection and validation from others who might share similar feelings, which further underscores the isolation the person is experiencing. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a combination of emotional distress and social withdrawal."
"Does anyone else feel like they have friends but you can't relate to them because your hobbies are too weird?I have a few friends who I would consider close, mainly because they check up on me and invite me to go places. But I feel like I have no one to talk about the things I'm really passionate about without feeling like they are just waiting for me to stop to change the topic.I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years not long ago  and she would put up with my nonsense and it felt like she was genuinely interested in what I had to say. But as far as my boys go they don't really seem to care.And it's not that my hobbies are weird, it's just that no one my age group is really into it. I'm 20 and I am really interested in older cars. The fact that a car from the 60s can run without the help of a computer is amazing to me.I recently bought a 1966 Chrysler Newport and the owner of the car is a retired firefighter and me and him actually got along really well. He asked me if I could help him wire up some stuff on a older truck he has. I think this is cool but the fact that I have to be friends with someone three times my age shows how far off my hobbies are from people my age lol. I also like talking about guns and playing DayZ on my computer, which is a very niche game not many people play. The one hobby I feel like I can relate with people is weight lifting, as I do it very frequently. But I wouldn't really consider it a hobby since I don't really enjoy it. Mainly doing it to look good naked.But yeah... That's my little rant. Feels good to get it off my chest.",1,"the narrative highlights several indicators of loneliness despite the presence of friends. the author expresses a sense of disconnection and inability to relate to their peers due to unique hobbies and interests. this feeling of isolation is compounded by the recent breakup with a girlfriend who previously provided a sense of understanding and interest in their passions. the author mentions that their friends check up on them and invite them out, but there's a significant emotional gap as they feel unable to share what truly excites them without being dismissed. this disconnect is further emphasized by their interactions with an older individual who shares their interest in older cars, indicating a lack of peer connection around these hobbies. the mention of weight lifting as a shared activity with others, yet not truly enjoying it, underscores the superficial nature of some social interactions. overall, the narrative reflects classic signs of loneliness, including the feeling of not being understood, the struggle to find meaningful connections around personal interests, and the emotional impact of recent relationship changes."
"Just a lonely teen (17m) - talking about myselfThis post doesn??t have a point to it. I just want to express my thoughts anonymously. This post is just a dump of my inner thoughts. The writing will be all over the place   


When I??m older I??m not gonna remember my teenage years, I barley even remember them now honestly. I don??t remember when my feelings of loneliness began, possibly 2018 when all of a sudden I just started thinking negatively and haven??t stopped. I??ve never had a best friend who I can tell anything, who I can spend time with laughing and talking about anything. My friends I was ??close?? with then I??m not now. 2 of them are in my current group but i don??t talk to friend M because I didn't feel like she valued me as a friend (rightfully so) this I realised last year, same with friend F but I still share a few words with her occasionally. I think my insecurI ties about my sexuality and expressing myself is the reason why I don??t let people in. 

I do have friends but I??m not as close as I could be with them. If I accepted my self earlier maybe I??d be closer to them.

God writing about social shit for me is kinda hard - all these ??issues?? stem from me not accepting my self sooner. I??d be closer to people and have more confidence if I accepted my sexuality and self identity but I haven??t. I can Invision an alternate dimension where I accepted myself sooner a reality where how I view socialisation is different and it??s not so weird.   


My life isn??t hard at all, it??s easy. I have no issues in life except for my mental health. I could be depressed idk. I think I probably am but I don??t plan on getting diagnosed. Ok so I guess my life is fine, all my issues are in my head. I don??t need to be expressing my thought here but I am.

When I see other people at school I feel like they??ve accepted their identity already. They have lives and friends. And they aren??t struggling with self worth and sexuality but I know that??s not true. Everyone is dealing with something,, I know that but that??s just how I view the world around me. I know life for everyone isn??t perfect but at least they feel comfortable with who they are. I think that??s the most important thing in life, your self worth. Because you see the world around you through your eyes and if you don??t like yourself your gonna view the world negatively.

   
I don??t have a plan for my future career wise but I think after high school I??d like to start working out and eating healthy to try and develop my self-esteem.

ive been writing this for a long time, just thinking about my life, what little of a life I have and how my issues aren??t really issues. I guess struggles would be a more appropriate word. I don??t have issues but I am struggling with my self esteem.   


TLDR 

\- I??m probably depressed because of sexuality and self esteem, lonely bc I don??t open up to people &amp; I keep everything about myself to myself idk if that makes sense

This post was a mess, just like my thoughts. If u have anything to comment feel free to do so :)",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and introspection. the individual discusses a persistent feeling of loneliness that they trace back to a few years ago, highlighting a lack of close, meaningful friendships. their struggle with self-acceptance, particularly regarding their sexuality, is a significant theme, contributing to their reluctance to open up to others. the writer's acknowledgment of their mental health issues, including a possible depression, underscores their internal struggle. they perceive a gap between themselves and their peers, who they believe have accepted their identities and lead more fulfilling social lives. the narrative is filled with self-doubt and a sense of being stuck, which are common indicators of loneliness. the writer's attempt to envision a different reality where they have accepted themselves earlier shows a longing for connection and self-worth that they feel is currently missing. overall, the narrative is characterized by a sense of being on the outside looking in, with the individual grappling with internal conflicts that hinder their ability to form close relationships."
"It's my birthday- all dressed up and nowhere to goFeeling very lonely. Lit some candles, got dressed. Having wine..all by myself. Alone in my porch. While my husband doesn't give a shit it's my birthday. 
This is the heaviest feeling in the world",1,"the narrative clearly conveys feelings of loneliness through the individual's description of their birthday experience. the person mentions being all dressed up with nowhere to go, which highlights a sense of isolation and lack of social engagement. lighting candles and having wine alone on the porch further emphasize the solitude. the mention of the husband not caring about the birthday suggests a lack of emotional support and connection, which can significantly contribute to feelings of loneliness. the phrase ""this is the heaviest feeling in the world"" strongly indicates the emotional burden and depth of loneliness the individual is experiencing. these elements collectively point to a profound sense of loneliness."
"the feeling is back.I feel the hole in my heart. With every beat it just feels like pain. Lately ive been numb. Havent felt this way in a long time. Why did it have to come back? Why do i yearn for any kind of connection? Why can't i go out and find it? I dont want to be secluded, but i don't want to leave my space. All there is out there is people who will lose interest with me. So why cant i just stay numb.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of emotional pain and yearning for connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author describes a ""hole in my heart"" and mentions feeling numb, which suggests a profound sense of emptiness and disconnection from others. the repeated questioning of why they cannot find connection and the paradox of not wanting to be secluded yet not wanting to leave their space highlights an internal struggle typical of lonely individuals. the fear that others will lose interest in them further underscores a lack of self-worth and social anxiety, both of which are common in those experiencing loneliness. the narrative's overall tone of despair and hopelessness reinforces the sense of isolation and the difficulty in overcoming it."
"Ever just surrendered to it?I've always been a loner, and not of my own choosing.  I try to make friends, but it's like I'm invisible and most people forget I exist after 2 seconds.  I will literally physically get shut out of groups when people close ranks, so to speak, and I get shifted to the outside of the circle so I'm not a part of it any more (I wish I knew how to describe this in words better, but it does happen).  The few friends I do manage to make turn on me once they get whatever they wanted, and resort to placating me with ""yeah we should meet up sometime"" and mysteriously always are too busy to actually do it.  Never had a relationship.  I can't even really make friends, let alone find a date.  My own relatives doesn't talk to me unless they are in the same room with me.  I flat don't exist to them.  No matter what I do, I'm an outcast.

I've had thoughts recently of wanting to just move somewhere new and not even bother trying to make friends there.  Then I don't have to feel like I'm being pushed aside.  You can't be ignored if no one knows you exist in the first place.  

Has anyone just said screw it?  Just accepted that life in general doesn't want you and embraced the loneliness and let it all be what it is?  I feel like the quote that ""no man is an island"" is a load of bull.  Some of us are, we just aren't known about.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and social rejection. the individual describes persistent difficulties in forming and maintaining friendships, feeling invisible and excluded in social settings, and experiencing betrayal by the few friends they do manage to make. these experiences contribute to a perception of being an outcast and a sense of worthlessness. the lack of meaningful connections extends to family relationships, where the individual feels ignored unless physically present. the narrative also reflects a sense of resignation and contemplation of embracing loneliness as a permanent state, highlighting the depth of their emotional pain. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, characterized by feelings of social disconnection, exclusion, and a lack of supportive relationships. the individual's contemplation of moving to a new place and giving up on making friends further underscores their profound sense of isolation and hopelessness."
"The Feeling of Isolation ReturnsEven after gaining a group of ??friends?? (more like people I hangout with sometimes), hanging out with them brings my isolation meter to 100. I feel like I??m nobody??s top priority and basically the outsider of the group. I crave social interaction but this feeling of being unwanted hinders it. At this point, I??d rather just continue being alone, but it may be the worst option.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection despite being in the presence of others. the author mentions that hanging out with their group of friends only intensifies their feelings of isolation, indicating that these interactions do not fulfill their emotional needs. the use of quotes around the word ""friends"" suggests a lack of genuine connection or closeness with these individuals. the author feels like an outsider and believes they are not a top priority for anyone in the group, which exacerbates their loneliness. the craving for social interaction is evident, but it is overshadowed by the pervasive feeling of being unwanted. the contemplation of remaining alone, despite recognizing it as potentially the worst option, highlights the depth of their loneliness and the struggle to find meaningful connections. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a lack of meaningful social bonds and a sense of emotional isolation."
"sadHi everyone, I'm a 21 year old female who's never really been in a relationship. When I meet someone I like I have a bad habit of getting obsessed even though I don't think I display it, they probably can catch on. Every single person I ""date"" leaves me for their ex or someone new (any relationships last maximum three months) it's really disheartening that I've never had an official relationship and I feel as though I must be doing something wrong but I can't gage what it is. I just want to feel loved and be loved and every chance I get seems to slip through my fingers and making my loneliness stronger and making me feel unlovable. I have no one to talk to because my friends get annoyed as I probably bring it up every few months but I just don't know what to do to meet someone or to get them to hang around. Any tips would help",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and emotional distress. the author expresses a pattern of unfulfilled relationships, which leads to feelings of being unlovable and disheartened. the mention of getting obsessed with potential partners suggests a yearning for connection and validation, yet this behavior may inadvertently push people away, exacerbating feelings of isolation. the author’s acknowledgment of having no one to talk to about their struggles and the frustration of their friends further highlights the social isolation they experience. the repeated failures in forming lasting relationships contribute to a cycle of loneliness, making the individual feel increasingly desperate and helpless. the narrative is marked by a clear desire for love and companionship, but also a profound sense of inadequacy and despair, which are common indicators of loneliness."
40m really lonely just watching football would really like someone to talk toLike I said,1,"the narrative reflects a sense of isolation and a longing for social interaction, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions feeling ""really lonely"" and expresses a desire for someone to talk to, highlighting a lack of companionship. the context of watching football alone, an activity often enjoyed in social settings, further emphasizes their solitude. this combination of direct expression of loneliness and situational context supports the classification, as it reveals the individual's unmet social needs and emotional distress."
Nobody caredI??m going through a tough time right now and I??ve tried to confide in my ??friends?? but they simply didn??t care enough to reply or give a response. It makes me feel so much worse knowing that nobody is here when I need them. Are friends supposed to be like that? Is this normal?,1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain, which are key indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses feelings of being uncared for and unsupported, especially during a difficult period. the use of quotation marks around ""friends"" suggests a sense of betrayal or questioning the authenticity of these relationships. the rhetorical question about the normalcy of such behavior highlights the writer's confusion and hurt, emphasizing their unmet need for social support. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness, as the individual feels abandoned and disconnected from those they consider friends."
"I'm so lonely that even talking to my close friends doesn't help at all, I still feel lonely.15M, I can't help but feel lonely, I am surrounded by people every day and I see and talk to friends almost every day but even when I talk to them I still feel the dread of loneliness, I feel weak and weary, I really don't understand what's wrong with me, talking to random people on Reddit doesn't help, socialising irl doesn't help either, I seriously need some understanding to all this, also it's not depression, I'm not like suicidal or anything I just feel so tired and lonely.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness despite frequent social interactions. the individual describes a persistent feeling of loneliness that is not alleviated by talking to close friends or socializing in real life, which suggests a disconnect between external social activities and internal emotional state. the repeated emphasis on feeling lonely and the mention of a constant sense of dread highlight a pervasive and chronic experience of loneliness. the person's self-awareness of their emotional state, coupled with the distinction from depression, indicates a clear understanding that their issue is specifically related to loneliness rather than other mental health conditions. the expressions of feeling weak, weary, and in need of understanding further underscore the emotional toll and isolation they are experiencing, typical indicators of profound loneliness."
"Nobody has ever wanted meNobody will ever want me

I'm a failure and unloveable",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of worthlessness and a profound sense of being unwanted, which are significant indicators of loneliness. the repeated assertions of being unloveable and a failure suggest a lack of social connection and self-esteem. the use of absolute terms like ""nobody"" and ""ever"" highlights a pervasive and enduring belief in their isolation. such negative self-perceptions and hopelessness are common in individuals experiencing loneliness, as they often struggle to see themselves as worthy of love and companionship. the overall tone of despair and self-deprecation strongly aligns with the psychological state of someone who feels profoundly lonely."
"Need to be able to give upI keep trying to have friends and find people to talk to. The sad thing is that I occasionally find someone willing to talk more than a few basic messages. I get my hopes up, and try to get to know the person. Before long, the same thing happens. Nothing. I get ignored and forgotten. Or I assume I will get ignored and forgotten and cut the person off first. And yes, I know that shows how broken I am. 

I am so desperate for any shred of human connection, I spend too much time seeking it out, checking for notifications, checking apps anyway when I see zero notifications??.and I keep getting let down. Over and over. And I am not mad at anyone. Nobody is obligated to talk to me. They just don??t feel a connection or have an interest and move on. It??s just how people are, including me, so I understand. But when it happens with literally everyone, including my family, it hurts. 

Ok, I have a wife, but she doesn??t want to talk to me or to listen to me. I try to talk but she is on TikTok or working or wanting me to be quiet, or mocking me for how I feel, or interrupting me or telling how I am worthless or wrong or just wanting to use me. I would rather be alone, but can??t. 

I need to be able to let it go, to stop trying to find friends and connections. I spend too much time worrying about something that goes nowhere, something that just hurts. I don??t know what I want to get out of this post, maybe tips on how to let it go? Or maybe I just need to vent.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and yearning for human connection. the individual describes a pattern of reaching out to others, only to be repeatedly disappointed when these attempts do not result in lasting relationships. this cycle of hope followed by rejection is a common experience for those feeling lonely. the writer's feelings of being ignored and forgotten, coupled with a preemptive withdrawal from potential connections, suggest a fear of further rejection and a self-protective mechanism. the mention of being desperate for any shred of human connection and the compulsive behavior of checking notifications indicate a high level of social anxiety and a need for validation. the narrative also highlights a lack of support within their family and marital relationship, exacerbating their loneliness. the spouse's dismissive and mocking behavior further isolates the individual, making them feel worthless and unheard. the writer's struggle to let go of the need for connections, despite the pain it causes, underscores the depth of their loneliness and the psychological toll it takes. the request for tips or simply venting reveals a desire for empathy and understanding, which they seem to lack in their current relationships."

Why am I so messed up?,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and worthlessness, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of being uncared for and insignificant, despite the vast number of people in the world. this pervasive sense of not being valued by anyone suggests a deep emotional disconnect from others. the repeated questioning of their own worth and the expression of hopelessness further highlight the internal struggle and despair often associated with loneliness. such feelings can lead to a negative self-perception and a belief that they are inherently flawed, which is a critical psychological insight into the experience of loneliness."

"BreakupShe left me a month ago, but we stayed friends. Like, we were best friends. And we still had sex. So it was like a relationship still. We cuddled, and everything. She got back with her ex, and its left me completely broken. This girl was the love of my life. I couldnt have made her in a factory, because she was so perfect. She dropped me like a sack of potatoes for this guy. It's been about a week, and I've contemplated suicide. I've hung out with a couple friends, but it's not the same. I wish I could go back in time and make things right. Fix things. Try to get her back, yet I know it's pointless. I just need to move forward. But I'm lonely. I have nobody. Friends who I smoke with, but that's it. No deep emotional attachment. I love her so much, and I cry every fucking day. It's so hard to let go. Now I'm lonely again. The exact same place I was before her. Working, only to go home and play games. I miss doing things. Going places. Going on drives. Late night gas station runs after sex. The feel of her in my arms.",1,"the narrative vividly captures the profound sense of isolation and emotional turmoil experienced after a significant breakup. the individual describes maintaining a semblance of the relationship through continued physical intimacy and friendship, which underscores the difficulty in fully letting go. the abrupt end when the ex-partner reconciles with her previous boyfriend leaves the author feeling abandoned and deeply hurt. the expression of suicidal thoughts highlights the severity of their emotional pain. despite attempts to socialize with friends, the lack of deep emotional connections exacerbates their loneliness. the longing for past shared experiences and the stark contrast between their current solitary routine and the previous relationship activities emphasize the depth of their isolation. the repetition of feeling lonely and the struggle to move forward despite knowing it's necessary further illustrate the profound impact of this breakup on their mental state."
"I miss the old meI feel like I lost myself somewhere and for the longest time didn't know about it until loneliness started hitting me. I used to be able to say what I wanted and talk about anything I wanted.

I can't keep living like this, I might just lose it one day.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and disconnection, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author reminisces about a past version of themselves who was more expressive and connected, suggesting a significant change in their social and emotional well-being. the phrase ""i feel like i lost myself"" highlights a deep internal struggle and a sense of identity loss, often associated with loneliness. the admission of not knowing ""how to start over"" underscores a feeling of helplessness and despair. the expression of wanting to ""connect again"" indicates a strong desire for social interaction and meaningful relationships, which they currently lack. the urgency in ""i cannot keep living like this"" and the fear of ""losing it one day"" further emphasize the severity of their emotional state. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with intense loneliness and a longing for reconnection and support."
"I feel so unwelcome around other peopleWhen I was little, my parents always said things like ??you need to fix yourself?? and ??If you don??t start *blank* I won??t love you anymore?? and have threatened to send me back to my ??real?? parents (they used to lie about me being adopted). When I was the new kid at an elementary school and tried to make friends with a kid who looked  lonely, she was immediately aggressive towards me and soon said something along the lines of ??No one will ever want to be your friend or like you. You??re gross, ugly, and stupid.?? When I was in middle school and actually managed to get some friends, and introduced some of them to each other, they started to hang out with me way less. I remember in 6th grade I went up to a friend because he promised to work on a group project with me and he told me ??go away and work on it yourself.?? I got upset at him and all he told me in response was, ??You know what, I don??t even want to be your friend anymore.?? I cried during lunchtime and he had the audacity to get a lunch lady to tell me to ??stop crying because it was making him uncomfortable.?? Speaking of group projects, they have always been among the worst experiences for me. I got called too stupid for drawing poorly in middle school and I forgot how to do something in science and someone said ??wow you??re not as smart as I thought you would be.?? Group projects became hell in high school. No one wanted to be in the same group with me for one project, so I had no choice but to not only work 4 times as much (it was a 4-5 people group project) but also present to the class for four times as long while trying to overcome anxiety and the terrible speech impediment I had. I got a C(+?) mainly because of ??my constant stuttering, trouble focusing, and working alone,?? according to the teacher. In another project, I was literally locked out of accessing the presentation online because a group member felt ??I was getting in the way?? even after I helped bring information and organized it; they kept my contributions in tact, I guess they just didn??t want me to be there because they disliked me. There??s also the time when I literally just asked a question to my group (a different group that is unrelated to the last one) and the leader straight up told me, ??Everyone here agrees and understands except you. If you can??t be on the same page, then maybe you should just leave the group?? even though I had tried my best to be helpful. I??d go on longer, and talk more about events that are unrelated to school, but this post has gotten too long already. Those same people are the ones who get awards, have loving families, friends who support them, ect. while I??m the one who??s stuck crying in bed. I wish I could live happily like they do and I??m trying my hardest, I really am. But it begins to feel impossible when you have been let down so many times and have had your self-esteem destroyed. I wish I weren??t so awful so the world wouldn??t have to think I deserve this. I feel so stuck.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and rejection that permeates the individual's life. the early experiences with their parents, who made harmful comments and threats, likely contributed to a foundation of low self-worth and insecurity. the repeated instances of rejection and mistreatment from peers further exacerbated these feelings. specific examples, such as the aggressive response from the child at elementary school, the betrayal by friends in middle school, and the exclusion and ridicule during group projects, highlight a pattern of social exclusion and humiliation. these experiences are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a lack of meaningful connections and support. the individual's longing for acceptance and happiness, contrasted with their repeated disappointments, underscores a deep sense of hopelessness and self-blame. the psychological impact of chronic rejection and low self-esteem is evident, as the individual struggles to find their place and feels undeserving of better treatment. overall, the narrative is a poignant depiction of someone grappling with profound loneliness and the emotional toll it takes on their well-being."
"HollowThis is what I became. Oh, and alone too. I thought I found someone special (my ex) but when we broke, everyone trated me like a pile of garbage. 
Also, my situation is huge paradox. People always define me as ""handsome"", so everyone ask ""how can you be so lonely and shy and very often single?"". Well, plot twist. Being good looking May help, but it's not a golden ticket for acceptance and happiness. At all. Especially if you are a boy. I only have some real friends (and I consider them a HUGE privilege I don't even deserve). All the remaining people only look for me when they need something (both in Uni or not). So I am not only lonely, but I also have unhuman expectations from others (I've noticed It especially when I try to date a girl). And that's depressing to see how this society Is based mainly on the looks.

But still, I'm lonely. Except for my Brother, nobody never ask me if I feel bad. Because I am the cool one, the ""chad that can't never, ever be depressed or sad"". But -SURPRISE- I am. I am not a playboy. I don't even have social (like Instagram). I love to read, and get lost in tales that are not mine (but I wish were). Tales lost in times..

"This is going to be a long oneFor the past ten years I have been very lonely with no family or friends keeping every single problem to myself but with the ten years of isolation came the suicidal thoughts, depression, avoidant personality disorder and self harm

"Trying to be ok with being alone . . . .I (47M) have been divorced for almost 2 yrs.  My adult children (ex's kids I adopted) have stopped speaking to me.  My only friend in the area that I get to see on a regular basis (2-3x a week) is my ex-girlfriend.  I have no other interactions with people on a regular basis, other than my best friend (lives in another state) calling me here or there.  

I have learned to be ok with being alone for periods of time, but I am alone for days at a time.  I can go days without people calling me or even texting me - other than my ex-gf who texts me.  I started taking Karate just to get myself out of my apartment, as I work from home.  Sometimes being alone for such long periods (2-3 days straight) with no one to call, to just chat with, gets hard and sad.  I have tried Meetups, volunteering, hanging at the local bar, to make friends, but . . . it's just not happening YET.

After almost 2 years since having daily social interactions I think it has finally caught up with me. I find it hard to sleep since every time I try to sleep, I think about how lonely I am. It used to happen once a month and gradually increased to every single day.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness, particularly through the individual's recounting of their social interactions and emotional experiences. the transition from daily social interactions to sporadic ones, happening only once every 3 or 4 months, signifies a significant reduction in social contact. this change is critical as it reflects a loss of regular social support and companionship, which are essential for emotional well-being. the individual's description of their time at university highlights periods of isolation, even though they initially coped with being alone. the move to a local university and living with parents, while practical, underscores a lack of peer interaction, which is crucial for someone in their age group. the person acknowledges that the absence of friends their age makes a difference in their social satisfaction. the progression of their sleep difficulties, from occasional to nightly, directly ties to their increasing feelings of loneliness. thinking about loneliness every night before sleep indicates that these feelings are pervasive and significantly impacting their mental health. the narrative paints a clear picture of how prolonged social isolation has gradually intensified the individual's sense of loneliness, affecting their daily functioning and emotional state."

I don??t have any friends and I noticed I find myself just spacing out in my own thoughts a lot more than I ever used to. Like going to the grocery store, I??ll get in the car and just space out and be deep in thought for a while before even starting the car.

Your eyes are full of tears and you feel that gaping hole inside you start to swallow you up. You want to yell and scream for help but you know no one will hear you. They are asleep and you're all alone. 

It's that feeling of being stranded on an island at sunset when you know the man eating crocodiles will come to get you at night fall. It's complete despair and total lack of hope.

"I literally live in the middle of a CornfieldIt's a very rural, very isolated area. There are barely any people around, let alone anyone my age that I can really relate to. I'm kind of an artsy guy, and out here it's mostly a few farmers and rednecks. Not that there's anything wrong with being those things, but it's not really my crowd. 

I've traveled. I spent a few years in a AmeriCorps and worked for the feds in emergency management for a brief bit of time, travelling the country. I made some friends, even had a relationship here and there, but I always seem to end up back here on my parent's farm. 

There's nothing out here. It's a blessing and a curse. The quiet is nice sometimes, but there's nobody to hang out with, nowhere to go. I've been stuck out here before a time or two. The longest stretch was nearly a year of talking to virtually nobody but my parents on occasion. Human beings aren't meant to live like this. It does terrible things to your mind. 

I'm taking a class at a nearby community college (it's a long commute), and God willing next semester I'll be able to take up a full time schedule and live on campus, but in the meantime it can be hard to cope with the loneliness.

"I'm So lonelyMan I don't even know what the fuck  to say, Lately I have been to lonely. I tend to be a night owl and play games for hours on end. Every night without fail I will think of girl that I have liked for a couple of years and wish so badly I could tell her how much I liked her. Also recently I learned that one of our mutual friends might be in some kind of a relationship with her and that kind of killed me a little. This is not a sexual type thing,I genuinely like her for being a good person and putting up with my stupid antics and yet still being able to smile at me. For the years I have known her we (meaning her,me and a couple of other people have gone camping) have done the usual shit high school kids do late at night like ask each other who likes who and play dumb games like Kill Fuck Marry, every time they ask me I never say who it is due to not wanting to look like a fool and also not wanting to royally fuck the groups dynamics, I always give them hints but they never guess. I have was forced to promise them that I will tell when I graduate (I am a junior,1 older than the majority of them) in 2020 and enlist because I anticipate that I will feel that way after being disconnected for so long or just not be alive. It just hurts having put up a wall of edgy jokes and drugs and when it really matters having so much  to give and  being loyal to a fault and then having nobody even realize that you deeply care for people when shit gets real.

All alone",1,"the narrative expresses profound feelings of isolation and despair, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the author describes crying alone, feeling lost without friends or family, and having minimal social interaction limited to essential errands like grocery shopping or visiting the pharmacy. the repeated emphasis on being ""100% alone"" and the rhetorical question about the point of life without anyone to share it with or love them underscores a deep sense of disconnection and purposelessness. the mention of no one checking in on them highlights a lack of social support, exacerbating their loneliness. the author also expresses fear of succumbing to their dark thoughts and a sense of helplessness, feeling unable to seek help due to their isolation. these aspects collectively paint a vivid picture of someone struggling with severe loneliness and its accompanying emotional turmoil."
"Nothing is getting better.(M, UK) Since the November of 2018 I??ve been all alone, after my first girlfriend which I felt (and still kind of feel) extreme love towards left I felt ashamed of spending time with our mutual friends, i moved further and further away from them every single day and now our only interactions are saying hi on the corridor, and my ex??s relationship with me has come down to not even looking at each other, I feel such shame that I cannot even do that. After she stopped me from committing suicide recently she was ordered to block me on social media by her parents leaving me with no way of even being able to try and keep some emotional bond with her. 11 months ago, I still had hope that we would get back together, that she would take me back, but I began loosing hope short after.. she started dating again, found new friends, was living her life while i was just rotting alone in my house, hoping for a miracle changing my life, spinning it 180 degrees... but that never happened, and never will. She will never want me again and i know that no one else ever will.. I guess that I??m just unlovable.
Maybe 3 or so months ago i met a girl online, we began just casually talking about life and both enjoyed it, we grew to be quite good friends but in the last month she was rushed to the hospital, later then transferred to a mental hospital, and the only information i was getting came from a guy that a week before all of that saved her after a suicide attempt. Now he got her out of there and is taking care of her at his house. We caught up on how she??s doing every day but in the past two days he hasn??t replied to my text, I don??t know what??s happening with him or her... and i once again just have no one, no one i can speak to, no one who cares about me.... i just want to meet that one person who I will be able to cuddle with, laugh with, just love and spend my life with... even the ??happy pill?? brings no resolution to the extreme emptiness and despair i feel in my heart.. 


Sorry for the length.. there won??t be anyone who has read the entirety of this anyway..",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and emotional pain stemming from a series of personal losses and unfulfilled desires for connection. the author describes a deep love for an ex-girlfriend, whose departure left him feeling ashamed and alienated from their mutual friends. the shame is so intense that he avoids even simple interactions, indicating a significant withdrawal from social connections. his hope for reconciliation dwindles as he observes his ex moving on with her life, while he remains stagnant and isolated, contributing to feelings of worthlessness and unlovability. the brief connection he forms with a new friend online is abruptly interrupted by her hospitalization and subsequent care by another individual, leaving him once again feeling abandoned and without support. his longing for a meaningful relationship and the inability to find solace even in medication highlight the depth of his loneliness and despair. the narrative is marked by a pervasive sense of hopelessness and the belief that no one cares about him, which are clear indicators of loneliness."

I know, I know, they can feel lonely too despite having people around them, but come on man, look at me",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and isolation. the individual expresses anger towards others who claim to feel lonely despite having friends and a significant other. this comparison highlights their own severe social deprivation, having not had a friend or social life for six years. the tone of bitterness and resentment towards those who have what they perceive as a more fulfilling social life underscores their intense feelings of loneliness. they acknowledge that people can feel lonely even with a social circle, but their own prolonged lack of any social connections amplifies their sense of being misunderstood and overlooked. these elements—prolonged social isolation, comparison with others, and feelings of frustration and bitterness—are strong indicators of loneliness."
"Living life inside your head is the loneliest feeling.I wish I was articulate enough to express them, even writing them down just doesn't do them justice. So there they stay. Trapped. And I'm entangled within them and I'm treading over vines that are wrapping themselves around my ankles and tripping me over every. single. day.Anyone else know what i mean?",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and inner turmoil. the author expresses a struggle with articulating their thoughts and emotions, which remain trapped within their mind. this internal entrapment is metaphorically described as vines wrapping around their ankles, causing them to trip daily, symbolizing the constant struggle and hindrance they face. the plea for understanding at the end indicates a yearning for connection and empathy from others, a common feeling among those experiencing loneliness. the vivid imagery and the emphasis on the repetitive nature of their struggle underscore the persistent and consuming nature of their loneliness."

"Friendships among co-workersI recently started a new job, so this mostly applies to my previous job.

But, I always felt like my co-workers got along better with each other than with me. Even when new people would come in, it seemed like the co-workers I??d been working with for awhile got along better and were friendlier/more talkative with the new hires than they were with me.

I understand part of it is because I??m more of an introvert and have some social anxiety. So, it??s hard for me to connect with people and randomly start conversations with people; even when it??s people I??ve known for a while.

It still hurt. Makes me with I was better able to start conversations with people and create actual connections with people.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of isolation and difficulty in forming meaningful connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of being an outsider, noticing that their co-workers seem to bond more easily with each other and new hires. this perception of being less favored or less connected can intensify feelings of loneliness. the mention of being an introvert with social anxiety further highlights the struggle to engage in social interactions, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the author's acknowledgment of their difficulty in starting conversations and creating connections underscores their yearning for social bonds and the emotional pain of feeling disconnected. these elements collectively point to an experience of loneliness, as the author grapples with the challenges of social interaction and the resultant sense of exclusion."

This year I wanted to go to NYC but didn??t want to deal with any covid ristrictions so I decided to go on a little get away fees hours away from home?? don??t get me wrong I have the most euphoric times with myself but lately it feels like sharing it with someone special or someone I trust would be sweeter.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness despite the celebratory tone of a birthday. the individual is on a solo road trip and expresses happiness in self-love and solo dates, yet there is an underlying sadness. this juxtaposition is a significant indicator of loneliness, as the person acknowledges a persistent feeling of disappointment and unmet expectations. the desire to share special moments with someone else, and the recognition that such experiences would be ""sweeter"" with a trusted companion, highlights the yearning for meaningful connections. this longing for shared experiences and the recurrent feeling of being let down on birthdays are classic signs of loneliness."
im just lonelyi dont know what else to say except i lost my friends an im alone. i go through my days busting my ass for what seems like meaningless schoolwork and stuff stuck at home doing nothing but stressing and coping with being alone. i haven??t had human contact in a year other than my moms hugs and i figet with crap a lot because of it all. i just cant sit still,1,"the narrative clearly reflects an individual's experience of loneliness through multiple indicators. the person explicitly mentions feeling lonely and the loss of friends, which are direct expressions of their emotional state. the description of their daily routine as ""meaningless"" and filled with stress highlights a lack of fulfillment and connection, which are common in lonely individuals. the absence of human contact for an extended period, except for limited interaction with their mother, underscores their isolation. the mention of fidgeting and an inability to sit still suggests anxiety and restlessness, often associated with loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone struggling with significant social isolation and emotional distress."

What can I do when I live in North Macedonia? I'm 17 and not only does it feel awful never having had a crush on anyone, I just can't find people with similar interests to talk about (pc hardware, programming and video games) - if we're not discussing on those topics, I'm basically a walking statue. Clubs don't exist here. I really need someone to help me find a solution before I finally snap and do something stupid.",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of loneliness through expressions of social isolation and emotional distress. the individual recounts experiences of being bullied and a lack of social interaction from a young age, which are common precursors to feelings of loneliness. the inability to connect with others on a personal level, especially with no history of romantic interest or close friendships, further underscores their isolation. the writer's mention of coping with constant depression and feelings of emptiness reflects deep psychological struggles often associated with loneliness. the specific interest in niche topics like pc hardware, programming, and video games, coupled with the absence of a community or clubs to engage with, highlights the difficulty in finding like-minded individuals. this lack of social outlets exacerbates their sense of being alone. the urgent plea for help and the fear of reaching a breaking point signal a critical need for social support and intervention, which are vital in addressing the profound loneliness described."

Anyway, I??m M17 (almost 18) and going to university for Sports journalism. I have never been in a relationship w a girl even though my countless attempts. Today a girl told me she doesn??t think we match  and that I??m a nice guy but not for her. And I??m not mad at her, or the countless girls who said the same thing. If anything I??m mad at myself for not being lovable enough for someone. I??m really not looking for a quick fuck, or nudes. I??ve tried online dating, irl, literally most things and I??ve lost hope. I??ve talked to so many different girls and there??s a reason why all of them said no. I don??t know what it is but I wish I did so I could change it. I don??t think I??m overtly nerdy or weird, maybe sometimes dumb or stupid but not trashy. I??m kinda sick of it, I??m lonely and I just want someone to be best friends with and be my anchor in a relationship we can depend on each other in. Is that to much to ask? I guess so.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness and frustration. the individual expresses a feeling of hopelessness after repeated rejections in their attempts to form romantic relationships. despite clarifying that they are not suicidal, the tone conveys a significant emotional struggle. they describe their consistent efforts and the pain of not being able to connect with someone on a deeper level. the self-blame and questioning of their own worthiness are strong indicators of loneliness. the desire for a meaningful relationship and the feeling of being unlovable are classic signs of loneliness, as is the yearning for an anchor or a dependable companion. these elements collectively highlight the individual's isolation and emotional distress."
"There??s a sign that I very much needed today, welp.Planned something a month ago to visit my old friends. Cancelled on me 2 days before the trip. Accommodate to any changes they wanted prior to trip. And yeah, still cancelled on me. This wouldn??t bother me if this is the first, second or even third time. I understand life is busy, heck, mine is extremely busy. But, this happening in me for the nth time? After multiple cancellations? Damn, this hurts. Not only do I get this, no one ever replies to me when I text them, even if I do, it??s ??oh sorry I forgot.?? Reading that multiple times again and again just tells me how unimportant and forgettable I am to these people. I try really hard to maintain these friendships. I spend so much time, energy, and money to make sure that I??m there for them. I rarely ever cancel and I??m there when needed or wanted. When plans get cancelled on you, but you see all their posts hanging out with other people. Man, I??d rather be dumped by another person. This just feels another form of heartbreak that I??m not sure I can ever recover from.

Also tried to make new friends. I thought I was part of a friend group. Realized today that they??ve been making plans and not inviting me. Got a pity invite today because someone accidentally told me. I can feel how unwanted I was. 

Man, what??s wrong with me? Yes, I??m not interesting nor boring. But I??m not awful. I??m not perfect either. But I didn??t think I was this disgusting person that no one even wants to be friends with..

I don??t know anymore.",1,"the narrative conveys a deep sense of emotional pain and rejection stemming from repeated social disappointments. the author describes multiple instances where their plans with friends were canceled, and their efforts to maintain these relationships were met with neglect and forgetfulness. the repeated cancellations and lack of communication contribute to feelings of unimportance and invisibility. the author expresses hurt from seeing friends socialize without them and feels excluded even in new social groups, where they receive pity invites rather than genuine inclusion. the cumulative effect of these experiences leads to a profound sense of loneliness and a belief that they are inherently unworthy of friendship. the narrative reflects typical indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, rejection, and the internalization of social failures as personal flaws. the author's contemplation of giving up on trying to form connections further underscores their deep-seated loneliness and emotional exhaustion."
"just wanna be someone's first choiceI'm always the last choice for people. I ask people to hang out and they tell me maybe or Straight up no because they have plans with someone else. hour later they tell me they're free because the person they wanted to be with canceled on them. Then I was told I should be happy someone used me as a second choice as they didn't have to pick me at all.

I wanna know what it feels like to be someones first choice. Have someone genuinely into you and want to hang out and be around you. Not cause the person they really wanted doesn't want them.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of longing for meaningful social connections and the pain of feeling consistently undervalued by others. the author expresses a recurring experience of being treated as a backup option, which exacerbates feelings of rejection and insignificance. the desire to be someone's first choice and to feel genuinely wanted highlights a profound emotional need for validation and belonging. such sentiments are strong indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a lack of fulfilling relationships and a pervasive sense of social exclusion. the narrative also suggests an internal struggle with self-worth, further underscoring the emotional distress associated with loneliness."
"I have no one.I had a very shitty day today. My baby daddy lost his job and we are way behind on rent and bills and I don??t get enough hours from work. Ended up having a big fight.


Mother knew what was happening and kept asking questions that she shouldn??t be asking about. I came from a family where they want to insert themselves when it comes to my personal life and my own family.


I have no one. I wasn??t born and raised where I am now so I have no friends at all. Don??t have anyone else to talk to, or go to. I??m used to being by myself and being lonely.

"I can't trust anyone and I hate itIdk if this fits here I just have nowhere else.

I have been going through a rough patch of life for the past couple months.  I can't bottle up my emotions any more but I can't talk about it with anyone.  For reference, I'm 21M, still living with my parents because college.  Every day now I feel like I'm just putting on an act whenever I'm around people.  I'm so self conscious that I'm too afraid to really be myself around anyone.  I only have a few close friends and I know for a fact that maybe with one exception they wouldn't understand what I'm going through because of their backgrounds and beliefs.

I just wish I had someone who I could talk to that wouldn't judge me.  I know there are various websites you can do that on (I'm on 7 cups for one) but the majority of the people on there don't seem to actually care about having a conversation and it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall.

I don't know how to explain it.  I can't trust anyone and I just want to curl up and cry because I bottle up my emotions too much.  I don't know why I'm even making this post, I'm probably going to delete this in 20 minutes anyways because I'm self conscious like that.  I'm not physically alone but I feel completely alone in my current situation.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and distrust, which are hallmark indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a strong inability to trust others and a pervasive fear of judgment, leading to significant emotional bottling. despite being surrounded by people, including living with parents and having a few close friends, the author feels emotionally disconnected and unable to share their true self. the mention of using online platforms like 7 cups and feeling like they are talking to a brick wall further emphasizes their struggle to find meaningful, empathetic connections. the desire to talk to someone without judgment and the constant self-consciousness underscore the depth of their loneliness. the narrative's tone and content vividly illustrate the internal turmoil and the profound sense of being misunderstood and emotionally isolated."
"aloneI'm alone, tis as simple as that. I don't have friends, I don't have irl friends, I don't have family, I don't have a partner, and I live alone. I don't talk much or go outside at all. I spend my days sleeping sedated, eating too much, noming edibles, curled up in as many soft blankets and comforts I have. My loneliness and traumatic memories have collapsed me into a being of nothingness. I'm just a pure ball of sadness and emotions that's too much for anyone to handle. I withhold myself from others so I don't cause anyone hurt or ruin anyones day. 

I go days without texting anyone, no one ever texts me first. Makes me feel unwanted and unloved. Maybe that's just what I am, an unstable unwanted freak who cries whenever someone leaves. I have real bad abandonment anxiety, the couple times I did actually meet people, I always cried when they left. It was so painful- the loneliness crushing me as fast as it could. It scared off a lot of people from being around me, and I don't blame them, no one wants to see a friend break down in panic as they leave.

My dreams are all nightmares. All mocking me. Thoroughly ripping off the scab each time. Sometimes I have a good dream, but then I wake up wishing I could go back. 

I don't know what my goal is posting here. I rarely ever post at all, I try not too. Maybe I just want my pain to be heard. Maybe I'm so bored and lonely I'm willing to do anything that'll get someone to acknowledge my existence. 

I'm really sorry.",1,"the narrative is a poignant reflection of profound loneliness. the author explicitly states their lack of social connections, including friends, family, and a partner, which are significant indicators of loneliness. their isolation is further emphasized by their lifestyle, spending days indoors, sedated, and wrapped in blankets, which suggests a withdrawal from social interactions and the outside world. the expression of feeling like a ""pure ball of sadness"" and the mention of traumatic memories indicate a deep emotional pain that compounds their sense of loneliness. the author’s self-perception as ""unwanted and unloved"" and their abandonment anxiety are typical psychological markers of loneliness, as these feelings often stem from a lack of meaningful connections and support. the narrative also highlights the cyclical nature of their loneliness, where their fear of abandonment leads to behaviors that inadvertently push others away, reinforcing their isolation. their infrequent communication and the absence of outreach from others contribute to their feelings of being unseen and unheard. overall, the narrative vividly encapsulates the emotional and psychological state of someone experiencing intense loneliness, characterized by social isolation, emotional distress, and a pervasive sense of being disconnected from others."
How do you guys find friendsI think I really need friends that are like me but it??s very hard to find. I??m so tired of crying every night.,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness and emotional distress. the individual's plea for advice on finding friends indicates a lack of social connections, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the mention of needing friends ""like me"" suggests a desire for deeper, more meaningful relationships that resonate on a personal level, highlighting feelings of isolation due to a lack of understanding or shared experiences with others. the expression of being ""tired of crying every night"" points to significant emotional pain and ongoing suffering, which are strong indicators of chronic loneliness. the narrative's tone and content reveal the individual's struggle with finding companionship and the emotional toll it has taken, underscoring the depth of their loneliness."
"Bored and lonelyThe weekends are hardest for me. I just got sober 2 months ago, so my depression is a lot louder. I (30M) live alone and only have one friend to talk to, and he lives hours from me. I wish I had more people to communicate with on a regular basis. When I was 17 I was in a relationship for one year, then went into a relationship for 9 years, then had a thing with my first ex up until July. This is the first time in 13 years that I'm completely alone and I hate it.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and longing for social connection, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions that weekends are particularly difficult, highlighting a lack of activities or companionship during those times. their recent sobriety has amplified their feelings of depression, suggesting that they are struggling to cope with their emotions without the crutch of substances. living alone and having only one friend who is geographically distant further exacerbates their sense of isolation. the mention of past relationships and the fact that this is the first time in 13 years they are without a partner underscores a significant change in their social environment, contributing to their current state of loneliness. the expression of a desire for more regular communication with others is a direct indication of their need for social interaction and support."
"i??m the backup friendi??m 23 F and I live on an island.

"Just a vent. Sorry.When I was 13 I had a crush on this girl from school. I was too afraid to say anything, so we just became friends. Then, at 15, she says to me, all of the sudden, that she thought I was cute and she liked me. She said this to me over the phone. When she was moving to another country. 

At 17, I hang with this guy that's in 4 of my classes. He's popular, handsome and has great social skills. We have nothing in common, but still cares about me and asks me things about myself. He smiles everytime he sees at me. And it's very confusing- I didnt know what or how to feel, only that I liked the way I felt when I was around him. So yeah, I start to like this guy. Then I had this lame thought that maybe he likes me back. And, out of fear of things ending up like 2 years ago with this girl , I tell him. He asked me if I was joking. He stopped talking to me as soon as he realized I was serious. Ghosted me and blocked me from FB. 

I know it doesnt seem like much of a deal, but it hurt like hell. Made me feel bad about myself, and then depression and anxiety got worst. I started to hide every feeling- good or bad. I just didnt want to get hurt again. Not by dates, not by friends, not by family. I didn't wanna feel any thing.

I tried to date after that. The few people interested in me would get the idea that I wasn't into them. And I don't blame them. I've always been bad at talking and keeping in touch. I'd seem 'numb' or even bored to them and they'd leave. And this hurt even more so I tried to get ahead of em, and I'd push them away before they could to the same to me. 

But now, at 27, after this woman that was into me for the past year is now in a relationship, I wanna stop doing that. I wanna re-learn to talk to people. Not just to date. I don't wanna give this vibe that I hate everyone. I don't wanna feel numb and empty inside.",1,"the narrative describes a series of emotionally painful experiences, starting from unspoken feelings for a girl during adolescence to a hurtful rejection by a male friend in high school. these events led to deep feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, culminating in depression and anxiety. the individual began to hide their emotions to avoid further pain, which resulted in a pattern of emotional numbness and pushing people away. this behavior persisted into adulthood, leading to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. the desire to change and re-learn how to connect with others indicates a recognition of the impact of loneliness and a longing for meaningful social interactions. the narrative reflects common indicators of loneliness, such as emotional isolation, fear of vulnerability, and a pervasive sense of emptiness."

Thank you for your time.,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a recent return from deployment, a period often associated with significant stress and the need for reintegration into civilian life. upon returning, the discovery of infidelity and the subsequent departure of their spouse exacerbates feelings of abandonment and betrayal. the explicit mention of feeling ""super down and lonely"" highlights a deep emotional void and a craving for connection. the plea for someone to talk to and the expression that ""anything helps"" underscore a desperate need for social support and human interaction, which are critical elements in alleviating loneliness. these aspects collectively point to an acute experience of loneliness and a yearning for companionship and understanding during a challenging time."
"I'm in highschool and recently I've come to the realization that I don't have any friendsI feel kind of weird for posting this because I don't want people to think that I'm being self-centered by doing so, but I have to let this out. I am seeking attention in a way tbh. However, it's because I have no one else to turn to about my feelings, and I just can't hold it all in anymore. 

I have always been the type that is very shy. When I was little my mom said I wouldn't even talk to them, so she had to put me in speech therapy. I've always been very shy at school too, but I did make friends. I have always had friends by my side. Now though I don't. I've grown apart from my childhood bestfriend and others, 1 of my friends moved away and I only have one person I talk to from school left. However, it's not to the point where we can hangout in person. She probably doesn't want to anyways because we have known each other  for a couple years, and it has never gotten to the hanging out phase. I also have a couple people other people I talked to at school, but I don't have any of their social medias or anything. 
It just hurts seeing my sister have fun with her friends while I'm just at home. She always does phone calls with them, and whenever it's at night I sit through hearing the whole thing and getting in a bad mood because I don't have anyone I can call. I do have family, but family is suppose to like you. Also it's not the same as having a friend that chooses you because they are interested in you. 

I just want someone in my life who will be there for me and can hangout at the mall or a concert or just in my living room with me again. I've never admitted this to anyone, but I really want to let this out. When I was going to school in the morning this year everyone was talking to their close friends, and I didn't have any close friends. I didn't want to seem weird for standing somewhere alone, so I would wait to use the bathroom till I got into school so that I didn't have to deal with it. People probably saw me and thought I was weird for doing that, but either way there would have been judgement by others. I'd rather have less people see me by going into a bathroom then a bunch of students walking by me seeing me alone. 

My mental health is going down because of this. I can't do anything about it at the moment though because of the current pandemic with not having school or ways to meet others. I have tried online friends and I love them, but they are just not the same. 

I'm glad to get this off my chest and tell my story. I hope you all are having a lovely day, and I'm here for you ????",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and longing for meaningful social connections, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a history of shyness and difficulty in forming lasting friendships, which has resulted in a current state of having almost no friends. the mention of feeling weird for posting and seeking attention suggests a desperate need for validation and connection. the comparison with their sister's social life highlights the pain of their own lack of social interaction. the narrative also touches on the impact of the pandemic, which has exacerbated their feelings of isolation by limiting opportunities to meet new people. the emotional toll is evident as they describe their mental health declining and the lengths they go to avoid the perception of being alone, such as waiting to use the bathroom to avoid standing alone. the overall tone is one of sadness and a yearning for companionship, underscoring the profound loneliness they are experiencing."
"I guessIt's partly the fact that I know my place in loneliness. I guess its partially that I'm aware of my part in making myself unapproachable. I guess it's the acknowledgement that I run from those who want me, that fact which makes me feel as if it cannot be my fault. As if the tears which I swallow every night are the result of some other person for whom I am not responsible. Or the decision of another unaffected by my opinion.

I suppose the most difficult part of moving forward is admitting it's my fault. That I get hung up on people. I don't allow myself to move on because I'm afraid of entering a relationship that will fail. It's me who pushed the people who liked me away, me who decided to stay home tonight instead of going out and me who took those steps towards self-destruction. 

This is not a prison inescapable through outward forces. It is not one manned by others or guarded by any. This is a prison powered solely through the individual, with bars of arrogance holding me within.

I realize it's my fault.

I just want to move on.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep introspection and self-awareness that often accompanies feelings of loneliness. the author acknowledges their role in their isolation, noting behaviors such as making themselves unapproachable and pushing away those who show interest in them. the repeated mention of personal responsibility for their situation, along with the imagery of swallowing tears every night, underscores a profound sense of internal struggle and emotional pain. the use of metaphor, describing their state as a self-made prison, highlights the perception of being trapped by their own actions and fears. this internal conflict and recognition of self-sabotage are typical indicators of loneliness, as the individual grapples with both the desire for connection and the fear of vulnerability and potential failure in relationships."
"Are you sometimes feeling lonely even you are around people?I really feel like that for a long time. I can't say that I don't have friends. I know a lot of people. But are they my friends? I talk to them... They talk to me. They tell me daily life stories and so do I. But I don't have the feeling of connection. I suffer from lack of meaningful conversations. Everything is just about nonsense. You don't have to agree with me but I think it's the worst to be with people and feel the loneliness. That you don't understand others. That you can't just talk and continue with casual conversation. I am lost in crowd, where everyone talk different language I don't understand. How I can find connection? How I can fight the emotion of alienation?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness despite being surrounded by people. the individual describes feeling disconnected from those around them, highlighting a lack of meaningful conversations and emotional connection. phrases like ""i do not have the feeling of connection"" and ""i suffer from lack of meaningful conversations"" are strong indicators of loneliness. the person also expresses feelings of alienation and being ""lost in crowd,"" which are common experiences for those who feel lonely even in social settings. the yearning for connection and the struggle to find it are clear signs of the emotional isolation they are experiencing."
"Loneliness is a habitI feel loneliness has become my strong habit...

I get so used to being alone and eating alone that even my colleagues invited me to have a dinner together today, I just refused. I even feel a bit afraid of eating in a restaurant.

"What does it feel like to be lovedI don??t think there??s even been a Tim where I was loved in any sort of capacity.

"Birthday woesI'm so disappointed my best friend forgot my birthday. We were just recently talking about birthdays and I mentioned I had already gotten her present which I think she would really love. This is the one day a year where I think I shouldn't have to message people first for them to remember it's my birthday (close friends of course). Even a facebook post, since facebook alerts you to birthdays and I can tell they were on facebook today.

I was really looking forward to today.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of disappointment and sadness stemming from the author's unmet expectations on their birthday. the mention of their best friend forgetting their birthday, despite recent conversations about birthdays and the effort the author put into getting a present, highlights feelings of neglect and unreciprocated care. the author's expectation that close friends should remember their birthday without prompting, and their observation that even a facebook reminder did not result in any acknowledgment, underscores a longing for validation and recognition from their social circle. the phrase ""i hate the lonely feeling that creeps up"" explicitly identifies their emotional state, while the observation that ""everyone else is busy with other things"" compounds their sense of isolation and neglect. the overall tone of the narrative is one of yearning for connection and feeling let down by those they consider important, which are strong indicators of loneliness."

"I feel like I??m different than everyone else.I think I??ve finally found the answer to why I??m so lonely. It??s simply because, I??m different. Now I??m not one of those people that try their hardest to be different. (i.e disagreeing with popular opinions, hating on popular things) In fact, I wanted to be the same as everyone else for so long. It wasn??t until recently that I??ve started to come to this realization. The problem with this is that because I??m so different, I don??t really have anyone to relate to. (It??s why I??m so lonely) I think I may have found someone like me but I can??t see them right now. (summer break) Am I the only one who feels like this?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and self-awareness about the author's feelings of loneliness. the author expresses a belief that their perceived differences from others are the root cause of their loneliness. they mention a desire to fit in and be like everyone else, which suggests a struggle with acceptance and belonging. the realization that they are different has led to feelings of disconnection, as they feel they have no one to relate to. the mention of possibly finding someone similar but being unable to see them due to summer break adds to the sense of isolation and longing for companionship. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they highlight the author's struggle with feeling understood and connected to others."

But I also can??t share my good news that I picked out new frames for my glasses and how excited that makes me. 

I??m only accustomed to the suckage of loneliness in a few areas, but this new uncharted area drives home how many ways it??ll be revealed to suck in the future that haven??t even dawned on me yet. Yay.",1,"the narrative vividly illustrates a deep sense of isolation and the emotional toll it takes on the individual. the person describes a significant medical issue, retinal detachment, which is already a stressful and fear-inducing situation. however, the emotional impact is compounded by the realization that they have no one to share their fears or seek comfort from. the lack of a support system is highlighted by their inability to share both their anxieties and small joys, such as picking out new frames for their glasses. the narrative touches on the pervasive and multifaceted nature of loneliness, indicating that it affects not just major life events but also everyday moments. this reflection on the broader implications of their isolation suggests a profound and ongoing struggle with loneliness, exacerbated by the absence of emotional connections and support."

I understand as adults we become busy, but i feel like i??m just being ignored by my friends. I used to message them daily to ask about their lives, but i learned not to since they wouldn??t reply to me and i felt i was annoying them. I then started messaging then maybe once a week, and even then they either leave me on seen or don??t open my messages. And it??s okay, i understand.. But sometimes i feel like i really need to talk to someone and i have no one. I don??t have a mom, and my sister has her own mental health problems. I??m only close to my grandmother but she constantly invalidates my emotions. I feel like i have no one on this planet to talk to. No one that genuinely cares.. Sorry for taking your time haha",1,"the narrative vividly describes a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain. the writer expresses feelings of physical discomfort due to their loneliness, highlighting the severity of their emotional state. the lack of close relationships with family members and the perception of being ignored by friends are significant indicators of loneliness. the individual's attempts to reach out and their subsequent feelings of being a burden further underscore their sense of disconnection. the mention of invalidation from the one close family member they have also contributes to their feeling of being uncared for. the apology at the end suggests a low sense of self-worth and a belief that their feelings are not important to others, which is a common trait among those experiencing loneliness."
"Love (vent)I know everyone feels this way and its not a much different post but, all I want is to be loved. Not sex, not horny stuff exclusively just intimacy. Being held, being told ""I love you"" and "" you matter to me"", being cuddled, someone to come home to and tell about your day. I'd die to be sending the standard goofy love/relationship stuff to someone right now no matter how corny they might look.

"Trying to help myself out of depressionI suffer from severe depression and I'm really trying to work on myself to get out of it and live 
But the one thing I struggle with is being very emotionally dependant on peoe that can't always be there for me. I feel lonely when they don't reply often and it feels like months have passed even though I saw them a few days ago. This is the one thing holding me back and I don't know how to break away",1,"the narrative reveals a deep struggle with severe depression, and a significant aspect of this is the individual's emotional dependence on others who cannot always be present. the feeling of loneliness is pronounced when there is a lack of response from these people, which exacerbates the sense of isolation. the perception of time elongating when they are not in contact indicates a heightened sensitivity to social interactions and a reliance on them for emotional stability. this dependency and the resultant loneliness when social support is absent are classic indicators of loneliness. the person's acknowledgment of feeling lonely and the impact it has on their mental health further underscores the pervasive sense of isolation they experience."
I hate having a perfect opportunity to hangout with people but there is no one to hangout with.I have so many hours left in the night and I know I'm going to waste them all not having any fun by myself. All this just to wake up in the morning and forced to do things I don't want to do.

"Night is the worstI have felt lonely most of my teen years and I still do. I am a 22M with depression since I was 15 yo.

I feel there is something wrong with me, like a curse. Everyone tends to forget me, stops talking to me at some point. Even though I have a girlfriend, I feel so lonely even when I am with her. She basically the only person I talk to outside my family. Lately I've started to zone out when I am with her. My mind just turns itself off. It's like I am stuck in some empty place.

At night this feeling of loneliness gets worst. From my house I can see all my town, and when I look through the windows I think I am nothing more than an ghost. I feel that if someday I go and become one with the dark night, when the sun rises next morning no one will have a single memory of me. Other times I wonder who will show up at my funeral.

There is no moon tonight. Each day the darkness calls grow stronger. I have taken different medications, I've tried different routines, tried to keep myself busy.... It never works. I may be stuck in the past, because I can't get over the fact that I lost a friend due to my untreated depression. I was a complicated case back then. I can't get over the fact that our relationship will be same as before.

Sometimes I text him, but I feel some weird energies, as if I am annoying him. To be truthful, I feel this way towards everyone. I just want to shut myself in, people always hurt me. I can't understand how relationships work, how one makes friends... My therapist says I am in the autism spectrum, but I am not autistic. In her words, my depression comes from this inability to connect to people.

Even if nights are the worst, I love them the most. At night nothing changes. During the day there are too much movement and changes.",1,"the narrative vividly describes an ongoing struggle with loneliness, characterized by feelings of isolation and disconnection despite having a girlfriend and family. the author expresses a sense of being forgotten and unnoticed by others, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the mention of zoning out and feeling like being in an empty place while with his girlfriend suggests a deep emotional disconnection. the imagery of looking out at the town and feeling like a ghost underscores a profound sense of invisibility and insignificance. the contemplation of who would attend his funeral and the growing allure of darkness at night further highlight a severe sense of loneliness and despair. the struggle to connect with others, exacerbated by past trauma and untreated depression, aligns with the therapist's suggestion of an inability to form relationships. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with intense loneliness, feeling trapped in a cycle of emotional pain and isolation."
Alone againI lost my one person last night. I pushed it too far to make him prove he cared and it didn??t work out. Does anyone else do this? I feel weirdly happy to know the truth but also just desperately sad and lonely again. I need to stop accepting fake friendships and one sided relationships. This is part of why I feel so lonely because I??ll take whatever I can get.,1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of loneliness through the expression of loss and emotional turmoil. the individual describes losing a significant person, which highlights a recent and impactful event that has intensified their feelings of isolation. the mention of pushing too hard to prove the other person cared suggests a pattern of seeking validation and reassurance, often seen in those struggling with loneliness. the conflicting emotions of feeling both relieved to know the truth and desperately sad underscore the complexity of their emotional state. the admission of accepting fake friendships and one-sided relationships further illustrates a pattern of settling for less meaningful connections, driven by a fear of being alone. this pattern is a common indicator of loneliness, as individuals may lower their standards to avoid the pain of isolation. overall, the narrative contains multiple elements that are typical indicators of loneliness, including recent loss, a need for validation, emotional conflict, and a history of unfulfilling relationships."
"All my friends end up hitting on meI love having friends and am not looking for a relationship. As a Bi male, I almost always get asked out by my friends for some reason.

"lonely 23rdI just turned 23 and it was as anticlimactic as normal. I went to work and everyone sang to me and it felt nice and I talked with my mom for a bit, but I cant help but see how much everyone cares about other peoples birthdays and it just makes me feel so alone. They always have so many people with them on their day hanging out, having fun, being loved. I know people care for me but I just miss having that physical presence. Here's to drinking on my own",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and isolation. the author describes their 23rd birthday as anticlimactic, which sets a tone of disappointment. despite the brief moments of joy, such as coworkers singing and a conversation with their mom, the author focuses on their feelings of being alone. they compare their experience to others who seem to have a more fulfilling social life, highlighting their own lack of companionship. the longing for physical presence and the act of drinking alone are strong indicators of loneliness. these elements collectively underscore the author's emotional state and sense of disconnection from those around them."
Im tired of itIm tired of working things out by myself. Lifes not easy i understand that but everyday im having mental breakdowns. Ive slept a total of 12 hours the past 4 days. All ive been doing is playing xbox trying to make friends or meet someone to talk to but its just not working. Im tired of everything.

"It's been a while, loneliness fills my very core :|I haven't felt as lonely as I am now in a while. My ex called me crying about her current relationship. No we didn't try to get back together, I simply reminded her that this was going to happen and calmed her down until she fell asleep. But it reminded me of what I had. Having a bestfriend and a girlfriend all in one, was amazing. I've been dating around and making friends a long the way. As I heated up some soup and poured it in a bowl, I caught myself just staring into it. Thinking why should I eat this, why not just get drunk and forget! My soup is still sitting here and I just feel so alone.

Why are good people hard to come across? In the dating scene it feels that girls have lost intimacy and expect to be treated like a queen with no intention of treating you like a king. In the friendship world, even the closest people will stab you in the back if it'll benefit them. I still have my small little circle, but noone is available at the moment and it just hit me hard enough to post here after a while of not. 

I was watching the Amityville horror, and there was a scene where George was just lying on the dock and I never related so much to it. I just feel so weak to keep going... I want to sell all my possessions and donate it to someone that would truly benefit from it, drink pass out and become part of the Earth. 

Thanks for reading this far :')",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness and emotional turmoil. the author expresses a deep-seated feeling of isolation, highlighted by their description of loneliness filling their core. the recounting of their ex-girlfriend's call and the ensuing memories of past companionship underscore a longing for connection that is no longer present. despite attempts to socialize and form new relationships, the author feels disillusioned by the lack of genuine intimacy and trust in both romantic and platonic interactions. the imagery of staring into a bowl of soup, contemplating the futility of eating, and the desire to escape through alcohol illustrates a state of despair and helplessness. the comparison to a scene in a movie where a character lies despondently on a dock further amplifies the author's identification with feelings of weakness and resignation. the mention of wanting to give away possessions and pass out signifies a wish to disconnect from their current reality. these elements collectively indicate a profound experience of loneliness and emotional pain."

"I feel like I'm always holding friendships togetherI often get the feeling that I'm always the person holding friendships together.

"First experience of lonelinessAfter realizing yesterday that I feel lonely first time, I started crying in the bed while trying to fall asleep in tears. Damn, that sucks. I also see my acquaintances throw party and my crush too. I hear these people talk and brag about their relationships, about how they experience the real love and so on. First what came to my mind is a scene from scrubs where JD talks about how lucky people are, someone who is relationship and have best friends to talk to: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB17flDpPH0&amp;t=5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB17flDpPH0&amp;t=5s)  
I am really trying to stay strong and not let the loneliness ingrain my mind when I want to gtfo my country. Well, I guess it was too late after reading so many posts in this subreddit.

A big and warm hug to you guys ????????, peace.",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual describes crying in bed, a common physical manifestation of emotional distress. they express feelings of isolation by observing others' social interactions, such as parties and relationships, and comparing themselves unfavorably. this comparison exacerbates their sense of loneliness, as they feel excluded from the happiness and connection others seem to enjoy. referencing a scene from a tv show highlights their yearning for the companionship and support depicted, further emphasizing their sense of lacking meaningful relationships. their struggle to remain strong and not let loneliness consume their thoughts shows an ongoing internal battle. additionally, their gratitude towards the online community for support suggests a reliance on virtual connections, often a sign of seeking solace in the absence of real-life interactions. these elements collectively illustrate a profound experience of loneliness."
"I really wish people around me cared moreI seem to have this constant thing of ??talk to me in school and stuff but never talk to me outside of school?? with everyone, like so many acquaintances but few real friends.

Not a whole lot of people even bothered to wish me a happy birthday and a few of the ??close?? friends weren??t even part of those that did, only like two, and I don??t think they would??ve known if not for me sending a meme on snap or through a shared birthday in a group chat of ours 

Another thing that happened recently: I would often rant on a spam insta account bc I don??t know who to even bother individually w my problems, so I just have to get them off my chest somehow.

If it??s that hard for you to see then why don??t you try to be there for me...anyways

And like idk I just wish I had someone that was checking in on me and I could talk about my day with and share banter and all that.

"No friendsI don't have any real friends. No one texts me or calls me beside my family and some acquitances, but it really doesn't go deeper beyond a simple ""how are you"". I have realized that I have been all my life in a lockdown that the whole world is currently in. I have reached out in some friends subreddits here, but people just stop responding or talk to me about how they miss their life before the pandemic. It makes me feel even worse, because my life before the pandemic was exactly the same. I have also realized that I don't have any experience people my age should have.

I know it is my fault and there is no magic solution, because I don't trust people and making friends is very hard for me. I am tired of faking everything. I have no problem with talking to strangers or to my classmates, but when I do, it's like I have this happy mask on that has nothing to do with how I feel, I have no idea how to open up. I don't know how to have deep friendships, and that's what I want, not some fleeting relations. I am wondering about how to change this, because I don't want to spend all my life alone, without friends, without a partner or without family. 

I don't really know why am I posting this, just needed to share.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and longing for deeper connections. the individual explicitly states that they do not have any real friends and that their interactions with others are superficial, limited to brief exchanges that lack meaningful depth. they compare their lifelong experience to the global lockdown, suggesting a persistent state of social isolation. attempts to reach out through online platforms have been met with limited success, exacerbating their feelings of loneliness. the individual also expresses self-blame and a lack of trust in others, which hinders their ability to form close relationships. they describe wearing a ""happy mask"" when interacting with others, indicating a dissonance between their external demeanor and internal feelings. the desire for genuine friendships and the fear of a future spent in solitude highlight the depth of their loneliness. this narrative contains multiple indicators typical of loneliness, such as the absence of close relationships, the struggle to connect on a deeper level, and the emotional toll of prolonged isolation."
"Feeling lonely while I am not actually aloneHi all,  


I have never actually talked openly about this so far and this makes me a bit nervous to do so as I don't really know how to explain it. But I feel like I need to.  


I have been feeling lonely for a good 10 years now. I am a person who works on himself, when I felt these feelings, I tried to connect it to my current situation and environment and thus my story.   


First I thought is having a relationship and that would fill the gap. I had a relationship for 4 years and it was fun and she was amazing but I eventually broke up with her. During this relationship I felt even more lonely. When your partner is fun and smart but you cannot connect on an emotional level, it doesn't work. I felt lost, I felt I was using her, I just felt that I was doing her wrong. I never cheated on her or anything but I just couldn't commit completely. So the best thing was to let her go.   


After that, nothing changed. I dated here and there. Had short relathionships but it lasted half a year or a year. I feel really bad and scared these last 2 year to try again. I cared for every girlfriend I had but left them all because I couldn't convince myself that it was the real thing. They all hate me for the fact I cannot commit. 3 years ago I realized I have never really loved anybody. How my friends describe love is something I have never ever felt. I have received it, but never been able to show it (hence the hate from my exes and I understand them and hope they will forgive me one day). They have moved on and I am genuinly happy for them. But envious as I haven't been able to move on fromt he same mindset I had when I was dating them.  


I have friends who I can call anytime of the day. I have loving family members. This was the reason I never thought that how I felt was an issue, because I believe I have it good. I feel blessed for my situation I am in but I cannot understand why I feel lonely.  


You can also not hurt me that easily. Insults I can take in like its nothing. I have a very sober mind for that and it works for me to stay calm and think rational. I always believed this was an advantage for me in live. But there was one thing my ex ones said to me in anger. She said ''you will never love anybody'' (calling me a cold person). This was 3 years ago and it is one of the few things that is hurting me till this day. I want to love somebody, really commit to her. But I really don't know how as I never saw someone and got the feeling ''yup thats it, she is the real deal''.   


I have connected me being lonely to love. I might be wrong but it is the thing I search for desperately when my lonely feelings get too much. I have done several things to try and fix my situation.  


\- I kept on dating to ''find the right one'' still felt lonely  
\- I learned new skills like playing the piano and just making music but didn't fill the gap  
\- I tried leaving my comfort zone by getting my skydive certificate while I am scared of doing it. Now I jump from planes and feel incredible (fear and adenaline really makes you feel alive) until I am in my bed the same night with my thoughts.  
\- I tried talking with my friends but they don't know it either  
\- I lived a year abroad (went alone) and made new friends new environment for myself. But this never helped either. Actually made me feel more lonely.  
\- Doing sports to build up convidence and try to love myself.

These feelings, I have put away for years. I always thought I am exagerating and in time it will be okay. But for the first time in my life, I really don't know what I should do. It keeps me awake at nights. Some friends tell me that I should be lucky that I don't feel that much as love hurts. But I would do anything to be blindly in love for once. Let my guard down and just go for it. Let my emotions take the wheel.   


I am not sure if I am making any sense with what I have written. I wouldn't make this post if I saw someone else with the same issue. But I see posts with problems that are worse than mine with people actually being alone as well, so I actually feel a bit ashamed posting this.   


If anybody has some insight on this or an opinion, I would love to hear it. Maybe something that have worked for you to find love. To learn to love yourself maybe? That is a whole another issue as well but my post got way too long to talk about self love.   


And if you think I shouldn't complain that much, let me know as well. I appreciate any perspective.  


Cheers.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness despite being surrounded by friends and family. the author has been struggling with these feelings for a decade, indicating a deep-rooted issue. their attempts to fill the void through relationships, hobbies, and extreme activities like skydiving have not alleviated their loneliness. the author mentions a significant emotional disconnection, both in their romantic relationships and within themselves, which is a classic indicator of loneliness. the inability to feel or express love, despite having a support system, further emphasizes their isolation. their ex-partner's comment about never being able to love anyone deeply affects them, highlighting their struggle with emotional intimacy. the narrative's tone of desperation and confusion about how to overcome these feelings is a clear sign of loneliness. the author’s continuous search for a solution and the lack of success despite various efforts suggest an ongoing internal battle with loneliness."

I??d rather be lonely than have fake friendsThis past week this ??friend?? got on my case cause I removed this ??friend?? from Snapchat. I removed the person because I was always the one sending the first text and it was never the other way around. Anyway the person kept asking me why I removed her from Snap and I told her that I know she never really cared about me (the person I removed was popular). She kept telling me she did but I know she doesn??t because she could??ve messaged me on any other platform but she never did.

"Does anyone else have insomnia, really bad stress dreams, and once in a while sleep paralysis due to loneliness?In the past year or so, my lifelong battle with loneliness has really started to affect me, partly when it comes to sleeping. I find there are many nights the soul-crushing isolation I feel 24/7 just creeps into my mind in really sharp focus, and it takes me hours to finally get to sleep. When I do sleep, I either wake up constantly throughout the night, or I've been having the worst nightmares I've ever had in my life, which have even led to episodes of sleep paralysis where I'll wake up and see some horrifying shadowy figure standing in my room.

Like, last night I went to bed feeling particularly down, and I had a dream where for some reason I was sleeping in this big Victorian mansion, and through the doorway of the bedroom, I kept seeing this tall, skinny entity racing in and out of the shadows of the hallway, which was dimly lit by moonlight. At one point it finally showed up in my room, and I ducked under the covers in the childlike belief that blankets were some sort of magic force field against the monster in the closet. Turns out the weren't, because whatever the thing was pulled the blankets right off of me, and I started feeling this intense pressure on me like someone had turned up the gravity by 100. The best I can describe the creature was kind of like the twisted humans from the managa The Horror of Amigara Fault by Junji Ito, the ""DRR DRR DRR"" things, only it was way worse somehow. I remember trying over and over to scream but no sound came out, and even in my dream I was thinking ""WAKE UP! WAKE UP!""

Finally, I did wake up, only for that dream demon to actually be standing over me, and I was feeling a pressure on my body, and I was trying to scream except it was more of a low closed-mouth humming sound. After about 5 seconds that felt like 5 minutes, it stopped, and instantly the first thoughts that flooded into my head, as it always does when things like this happen, was ""If I had a social life and I was happy this wouldn't be happening.""",1,"the narrative vividly describes the profound impact loneliness has on the individual's mental and physical state, particularly focusing on sleep disturbances. the person explicitly mentions a lifelong struggle with loneliness, which has intensified over the past year, leading to insomnia, stress dreams, and sleep paralysis. these sleep issues are directly attributed to the soul-crushing isolation they feel, indicating a deep sense of emotional distress. the detailed recounting of nightmares and the vivid imagery of shadowy figures and horrifying entities further emphasize the psychological toll of loneliness. the narrative's conclusion, where the individual links their sleep disturbances to a lack of social life and happiness, underscores the pervasive influence of loneliness on their overall well-being. these elements collectively illustrate the typical indicators of loneliness, such as persistent feelings of isolation, emotional pain, and the subsequent impact on mental health and daily functioning."

"Go from being fine/ok to being so sadI was literally having an ok day, and then the second I decide to go off my phone for a few minutes is when I got hit with the sudden re-realization that I am very much lonely. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. Not even just to vent to, but to have an actual conversation with. Whether meaningful or meaningless. I don't even have a pet like a lot of other people in my same situation do. You can only rely on online ""friends"" for so long until they or you become bored of one another. Then you're on to the next and they cycle continues. 

It's not even the fact that I am lonely,  it's the fact that I'm not even capable of changing situation. Having social anxiety and also being an introvert is not exactly the best traits to have when pursuing any kind of relationship. Plus I don't live close to the school I go to, so all the people that could be possible friend-material don't live near me.  (Its summer break FYI)

I have no one to make my life even remotely more interesting. I'm tired of living the same day over and over again. Sleep, eat, workout, repeat.  

I know people will say, ""only you can make yourself happy"" well ok, I guess?  But wouldn't having another good person in your life help? Idk. I wouldn't know.

"Today I took part in a voluntary trash cleanup, no one talked to meI saw and ad on fb for a voluntary cleanup of a local park/forest and I thought it would be a good way to be social. In the end only 15 people showed up, it was mostly high schoolers and people who are 35+. There was no one in their 20s I could connect to. Most of them came in a already formed groups and did things within those groups. We collected trash together but I felt disconnected and out of place. Besides few ""hi""-s and general comments about the trash no one bothered to talk much.

"You think your life is sh**? (READ MY STORY)Everything started in my third year of highschool, I was moved to another college (A better one, according to my parents decision). Before that, I was a normal kid, with some good friends in school. I lived with my both parents (I don't have brothers or sisters), had a nice dog, and everything else a kid needs to be good. We were a very happy family.

When highschool started, I was bullied by my other classmates with no reason. I was beaten by other guys twice, some others put some photos of me on the internet (To make fun of me), and a random dude thretened me with dead, just because I was new on that school.  
This situation lasted about six months, six months of crying everytime I arrived home, and waking up the next day was a hell for me. My parents noticed that I wasn't alright and they decided to take me out from there when I told them what was really going on. They  informed the situation to the college and I coun't finish the schoolyear.

One day I was walking back to my house and I was attacked by seven random dudes on the Street (They knew me from that god damn school) and they sent me to the hospital with a lot of cuts in my body and contusions.  
My parents freaked out, and they seemed very worried about my condition, so when I healed my wounds, they took me to psycologycal therapy so I can have some psychological support.

The theraphy was great, It lasted about one year and half, I had to took some medication to avoid developing depression and phobias.  
I started to feel better everyday, and my fear to walk on the streets started to dissapear, so I decided to finish my highschool in a adult education program. (I was still dealing with the attack I suffered and the damage that bullying can cause, but I made a huge effort to move on with my life)  
When everyting seemed to take a normal path in my life, my parents got divorced, so I had to move with my mother to another house where I wasn't allowed to see my dad.

I got very depressed about it, and started to feel alone and insecure because my mother changed a lot, she was never in the house. She worked all day, and in the nights she used to hang out with her new Friends.  
My father always called me to know what was going on, and we meet every saturday to hang out, have some pizza, or just talk about anything. He was the only one who was worried about me, but I wasn't allowed to see him during the week.

My mother started to hang out and getting drunk in the nights very often, and one day I find out she was spending all her money on the casino, so we were broken.  
One day she left me alone in the house to never came back. (She moved with her parents without saying a word)

When my father knew what was going on, he was very angry with my mother, so he took me to live with him and his mother (I was never close to my grandma, so this was a very umconfortable situation to me). But I was very thankfully to be with my dad.

After a long time being alone and kind of sad, I met some new friends, so things started to go well... The most important thing about this time was that, I met ""Caroline"", she was my first girlfiend. Caroline was very nice with me, we had great time togheter hanging out, watching movies, and she was very important to me in every sense, even more because I think she helped me a lot to move on my pain about my parents divorce, and my mother's runaway.

But Caroline didn't know how to stay on a relationship, after three years i discovered she cheated on me many times, (Not with a single guy, with a lot of them) I was very hurt, because I put all my trust on her and she failed me. She asked for forgiveness, but everytime I did, she screw it all again and again.  
I refused to dump her out, because I was in love with her, and I always thought that she could change, but NO, she never did. So after that 3 years  I decided to put an end to it.

Since we break up, Caroline stalked me in my workplace, in my house, she stalked my friends too. She even went to see my dad crying one time because she missed me, and my dad loved her as a daughter so he always tried to fix up everything between us, but I didn't want to see her again to be honest.

As she stalked me everywhere I go, her parents tought that I was still with her, and I was encouraged many times by them, threating to put a demand on me because I was a bad influence for her and I was damaging her feelings. (WTF!!) It seemed that no one else could see the pain I was groing through, I mean... she was my girlfrend and I loved her more tan anything in the world.

Well?? I moved on with my life, Caroline was put on a mental health insitutiion because she was diagnosed with depression after the break and then was moved to another city. After two years from that we both started university but we did not heard about each other anymore. (So I was single in that two Years)

My father was very happy because I got in university, and I was very happy too, I loved my career, my new classmates, my teachers were great, actually I started a band! and everything was great finally!Thats when my mother appeared again, she was very sorry about her behavior but she was happy for me to live with my dad because she knew he loved me and we were very Good Friends.

In the first year of university I knew a girl called ""Javiera"", we started to hang out for months until we started a relationship. She was very nice too, very intelligent, maybe more childish than Caroline in some aspects, but I enjoyed my time with her a lot anyways.

Javiera was very jealous, she thought every girl in the world wanted to fuck me... With the time she  started to change her behavior, She freaked out about anything, and left me alone a lot of times for stupid reasons. So I thought?? ""I will not fight her as I done with Caroline, I Will remain calm and talk with her"", but it was worse, because she got very violent increasingly until one day she got mad with me and jumped in her ex boyfriend car in front of me all my Friends/classmates. (I got very very ashamed)

I felt how my hate on life and people was growing bigger, but I didn't explode, because I can always count with my father and my band mates.

In the morning of 30 August 2018 I woke up as usual, and I went to my father's bedroom to wake him up for breakfast, but I found him dead in his bed. He was pale, cold, he had a heart attack?? I NEVER SAW SOMEONE DEAD BEFORE! I WAS SHOCKED!!!!

After the ambulance came to the house I called my fiends and mom to tell them what happened.  
It was the worst day of my life by far...  
That's when my life changed 200% I was very sad and angry with life, with god, with myself, with my mother, with everyone. The first two weeks I couldn't sleep well, had nightmares, cried every night,.  
My aunt paid for the funeral while I got the money to give her back, because as a family (my grandmother and me) was complety broken. The money I got paid in my workplace wasn't enoigh to pay for the funeral.

My grandmother left me alone in the house for two weeks, she traveled to the beach with some other family members, and the loneliness started to take over me... I started to fl paraoind and crazy about anything, because I had enough time and silence to overthink about the highschool, my mother, Caroline, Javiera, and now my dead father?? HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO SUFFER!? WHAT DO LIFE WANT FROM ME???

When my grandma got back from the beach she were very indifferent with me, she didn't talk to me, or anything. And one day when I came back to the house I found all my clothes in the street. Yes... she trowed me out the house. When I got inside, she started to yell me out  because she needed money to pay the rent and other taxes that my father used to pay and I didn't have it.

My mother helped me to take all my stuff and came back to the house we had with my parents,  but it was avery difficult task, because  we were attacked by my grandma and my uncle who also called the cops saying that I was stealing things from her house. MY OWN THINGSS!!!!!!!!

In this point, all my friends dissapeared, they were always busy, or didn't have time to hang out, or maybe have a cup of coffee?? I don't know why but seriously, they all DISSAPEARED.  
But HEY!!! I wasn't all alone, my band's drummer was always calling me, TO BORROW SOME MONEY FROM ME... or what about the other guitarist? YEAH! he called me too, but oh surprise, he needed a favor. -.-

I started to live by my own then, my mother visited me often, but I was all alone, and now with my whole family against me and dealing with the grief of my father.  
I started to develop a huge depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, and being by my own wasn't very helpful.

That summer Caroline appeared in my house, she learned about my father's death. So she was very close to me all that time. I thought she came back to support me as a friend, but she wanted to be with me as something more. (I know i was very stupid to let her got in my life, but I felt defenceless and the only thing I wanted was someone who showed me some love). So I accepted?? and I feel like I was in the sky, It was better this time, because she appeared in the worst moment of my life.

We spent time togheter doing the things we used to do when we were younger, and we were very happy, more tan the first time...  
One day I noticed something strange on her IG account?? there was someone who commented her pictures as he was her boyfriend??? And the comments were from weeks ago.  
Someday, Caroline texted me saying that she didn't want to be with me anymore. NOTHING MORE.  
And then I find out she had a boyfriend ALL THIS YEARS. They broke up, so Caroline came here to my house, and when they fixed things up, she came back to his boyfriend :)

In 20th August 2019 after a show with my band I tried to kill myself in the bathroom, because I didn't stand my depression, my mind was very noisy, I was vomitting everyday because of the anxiety, my hands were always shaking and my visi??n was blurry, but after hours thinking and looking at myself at the mirror I called my mom and she saved me from doing it.

The next day I came back to my house, but again, I was all alone...  
That's when my drummer's girlfriend showed up to cheer me out. YES! her girlfriend, not him. Why??? He was my friend, not her.  
But the thing is that she started to call me every night to ask me how I was, so I trusted her my feelings, what I was thinking, I told her how anxiety or depression feels like, and she always threated me as I was the most interesting person in the world, no matter how fucked i was.

One day she called me to tell me that her boyfriend (my band's drummer) left the city to live in another state for work, (They will have a distance relationship) She was very sad about it, but I tried to cheer her up as she done with me before.  
We talked for months, and she was very special for me, because she was the only one to convice me to see my dad at the cemetery.  
One day she came to my house at 10pm like a suprise. But she was a little nervous, I asked her what was going on and then  she told me that she was in love with me and she didn't love her boyfriend.  
I told her that she must be just confused, and we wll never have anything as a relationship.

She understood the situation, but she never tried to get away from me. Actually she was keep calling me everyday, or inviting me to a coffee.  
One day we were on my house, and we kissed each other. I felt something very powerful going on trough my veins, It was adrenaline and she felt it too.  
How can I do this?? HE IS MY FRIEND? but... is he??? He just call me to ask for money or favors, and everytime i tried to talk to him he was busy.

So long story short, we were hanging out and having sex for four months and we never told my friend. And do you know what? I didn't feel guilty at all. She didn't too.  
I believe in karma but karma is indebted to me. Always bad things happen to me without doing anything, everyone passes me by  and no one cares a fuck about me. So I started living and caring just about myself. I think about telling my friend the truth in many times, but I thought It was like betraying her, and was that a good thing? After all she was the only one who was caring about me.

This girl was in suffer, because she wanted to be with me, but she didn't know how to dump her boyfriend without breaking up my band, or her financial stability that he provided her (In her own words) and in the other hand I wasn't offering anything safe to her, because now I just care about myself.

So one day, she didn't stand it anymore and she told him everything. But, she told that I was stalking her, sending her texts and calling her everyday. When i find out she betrayed me, I tried to speak with her, but she blocked me. So the next day my band's drummer came to my house with two guys to beat me up. As the new person I became, I didn't hesitate, I pulled out my gun (Yes, I bought a gun.. Am I becoming BAD?) And I pointed it right into his forehead, and I told him to go and never came back.

The next day the police came to my house because he told them that I tried to kill him so now I have a charge for death threat.

That's how my life became what it is now.

"Extreme Independence is a trauma responseI(36M) read this somewhere and I was blown away. I have been living alone since last 5 years. I have a stable job and I??m financially independent with my own house. 

When I read this post somewhere on social media it made me reflect upon my life. The society where I come from isn??t very much open about mental health. I have had a very normal childhood or as I would like to believe but that wasn??t the case, I now realise. I was neglected by my parents because they were too entangled in their own lives and perhaps struggling to exist with their own traumas. My father was rarely present because he was too busy arranging livelihood for all of us. 

However, I did not learn to handle basic emotions. I was too reserved which was often mistaken as shy. I had no boundaries when it came to have friendships or relationships with other people. I worked under covert emotional contracts which did not work out too well for me. All my 20s I was in and out of traumatising relationships which always ended badly. When I got married in my late 20s, it ended up in divorce in 6 months. 

Now I live alone. I find people intolerable. I don??t like to hangout with anyone, it drains my energy. I kept telling myself that the only way to be safe and have no drama in life is to cut away people and that??s what I have done now. And I thought it was working for me.

"It Feels Like I've Become Feral During the PandemicSome context: 

I've always felt lonely, even in the presence of others (longtime friends, my partner, coworkers I get on with), but it never bothered me all that much. When I moved to Denver back in 2011, I didn't make a huge group of new friends, but we still got along, hung out, and still talk and support one another to this day. I moved back to my hometown in 2017 and reconnected with old friends and, to my surprise, made plenty of new friends at work. I'd host cookouts, or have people over for game night, or do activities with all of these people quite regularly.

Then, thinking I was helping a friend, I ended up in Montana knowing only my partner and this aforementioned friend. This friend needed roommates in order to stay in this town to finish their degree and my partner and I wanted to get out of our hometown (I also lost a friend at the same time this discussion was had and my grief-stricken mind thought I needed to get as far away as possible). A few weeks before our move date, the friend informed us she'd gotten into a program in a town four hours away and would only be with us for three months. I figured, okay, that's enough time to meet people and find my group and she promised to introduce my partner and I to people who we might get along with.

Fast forward to being in Montana and I hardly saw this friend the three months she was living with us, the cooking and cleaning responsibilities fell mostly on me, and the friends she had barely spoke to me or my partner when they came over. My partner and I are polyamorous, so we did try dating new people at first but no one really was a good fit for us - our circle stayed small.

Pre-pandemic, I made about four or five new friends, but I only really see two of them frequently since I usually hang out to smoke weed with them and just shoot the shit. The other three are significantly busier (nanny, promoter, drummer for a band), but we do have fun the few times we see one another.

The friend who initially brought me to Montana would come to visit, but I always got the vibe she only wanted to hang out because it was a guaranteed couch to sleep on. If we went to a concert or got breakfast with her friends, I always felt like the odd duck out of the conversations, even being ignored for the entirety of a concert/night on the town where I literally left the show for over an hour to play Pok??mon Go and no one noticed until the house lights came up. Afterwards, her and her group wanted to go to a bar where I was ignored again and just went to the car to listen to a podcast for an hour before they noticed I'd left again. We haven't spoken since that night.

Okay, now that that's out of the way -

I quit my job back in April. I was financially stable enough to take some time off and recover from the burnout the pandemic had brought on. During that time, I saw my partner and the two friends I hang out with regularly fairly regularly, but not as frequently. I also ended up with a decent amount of mushrooms, which was great, but also gave me the mental space to reflect on how depressed I was and how isolated I felt out here. Towards the middle of my time away from work and interacting with people, I ended up doing some amphetamines (insuffilated) and having a period of time where I wanted to socialize but couldn't really go out to places where people gathered. After coming down from that binge, I had a period of feeling unmotivated and more misanthropic than usual.

Finally, I decided to look for work and ended up getting a job a few weeks ago. I genuinely love the work (small kitchen where I'm one of four cooks inside of a grocery store) and I appreciate that it gives me a sense of purpose after spending two years working at a gas station.

However, I feel like mentally, I'm just not ready to interact with large groups of people, having to remember faces and names, trying to play the work politic game. My manager is friendly and we've had nice, quick conversations about bicycles and food, and one of the cooks I've worked with is a genuinely nice person, but we don't have much in common aside from the fact we both smoke weed and take psychedelics.

For the most part, anytime I speak up at work, it's work-related and nowhere near that level of comfort I had talking to new people in Denver or back in Texas. I spend my lunch break alone mostly to avoid the crowds at the store (I'm vaxxed, but still try to distance as often as I can), which doesn't bother me, but I know that probably means I'm not going to interact much with my other coworkers. Every day after work, I come home and have vented to my partner about how isolated I feel on the job.

Maybe it's just my brain not working right, or maybe it's just that breaking in period at a new job. I seriously considered looking for a new job today, even though I know I wouldn't be paid as well or enjoy the hours as much. I'm mostly just venting because I don't want to burden my partner with this when they feel just as isolated, so I figured why not just scream into the void and get this off my chest. I just want to be able to talk to people like I used to, but I feel like something broke inside of me during the pandemic and I'll never get it back.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and disconnection despite being surrounded by people, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author describes feeling lonely even in the presence of friends, a partner, and coworkers, suggesting a deeper, persistent sense of emotional isolation. the move to montana exacerbated these feelings, as the author struggled to form meaningful connections and felt excluded in social settings. the pandemic further intensified this isolation, as the author’s limited social circle became even more restricted. attempts to socialize, such as using amphetamines, only highlighted the author’s inability to connect with others. the description of feeling like something broke inside during the pandemic and the difficulty in engaging with coworkers at the new job underline a sense of disconnection and longing for past social ease. the author’s venting about isolation at work and the reluctance to burden their partner with these feelings further underscore the depth of their loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with significant loneliness and the challenges of rebuilding social connections in a post-pandemic world."
"The weight of the loneliness has gotten too much and I can??t do this anymore41 days ago I deleted all social media because I couldn??t cope seeing someone I loved with someone that??s not me (toxic af I know). I think it was because she was my only chance at not feeling lonely so when she left there was nobody else, she was it. I haven??t spoken to someone that isn??t close family or a stranger on the internet since August. She was the last person I spoke too. Deep down I??m so happy for her, but I??m sad for myself. She was the only person who ever ??got?? me and I don??t think I will ever find anyone else that does. I don??t know or understand how to connect with people, I have no idea how to make friends or reconnect with old friends. I don??t think that I will ever have anyone again whether it be a friend or a relationship. I logged on Instagram today to see the post that I was dreading, I was dreading it because it signified the end of mine and hers chapter for good, that??s it and there no coming back from it. I think I would be completely okay with it if I had other people but I don??t, I have no one.I don??t blame her, I??m not bitter or angry with her just at myself for letting it get to this point where she was my only way out of loneliness. I knew it would never happen but let myself believe it because I was so desperate for something or someone.
I haven??t had a hug in nearly two years now, I just want to be held, I just want to feel loved, I want to feel worthy of love. I want someone to love and care for me the way I do them.In the last couple of days I??ve come to accept that this will never happen and that it??s time to give up on that dream because I??m only delaying the inevitable.

"I don't know how to feel anymoreSo the title seems a bit dramatic, but at the moment I just feel like crying.

I don't know what to do, I probably won't do anything and just sit thinking about it.

i don't conventionally find myself attractive, and i'm not a very outgoing person, but close people around me always say i've really funny and have a good personality. I wish I just knew what people didn't find attractive about me. if i had to guess i'd say it's my looks or low self confidence. I know I should work on my low self confidence, but i want a boyfriend first, and I know that's bad. If you have a friend who's always third-wheeling, what would you want them to hear? does anyone have some real world advice on how to feel less lonely?

"Thanks to homeschool, I've been isolated for most of my childhoodSo I just need to vent right now because Im just so fucking pissed. I don't even know if anyone is going to see this but here goes

I'm 15M and when I was 7 my parents took me out of the private religious school they sent me and decided to ""homeschool""

Since then I've barely been around kids my own age, I've never had anyone I could call a friend (other than online, god I feel so pathetic having to add that) I've missed out on so many experiences that other teens my age have all had. I hate that I can't relate to anyone and I've got no god damn social skills. I love sports but I've barely done them because every place had to follow my dad's strict religious requirements

I've really only studied three subjects (English Maths and Science) and I'm behind on all of them which makes me feel so inferior and insecure

The only plus is I guess I've gotten used to the loneliness, can't miss something you've never had, right? Though sometimes I wonder what my life could've been like if I was normal. I wonder what it would be like to have friends, to go partys, to be around girls. Maybe I'm being dramatic but I feel like my childhood has been stolen from me.

"I tried to open up but I regret it...I've moved a lot throughout my life, but then came a time when I stayed at one place for about 10 11 years... Made a lot of friends, built good relationships with people.

Then last year I had to move again to a completely new country for my education. I had to leave everything behind, my family, my friends, everyone... I moved with one of my best friends that I've known for about 6 years, I felt a little better knowing that there was someone with me on this journey.

I was adjusting to the new environment i was in, trying to socialize with new people in my highschool, build new connections. Then some shit happened between me and my best friend and we stopped talking with each other, and all the people I've been talking to trying to socialize with took his side, which ultimately left me alone.

This happened a couple weeks before quarantine, and things weren't getting any better at all. I stopped communicating with anyone, i was basically the quiet kid that you know nothing about in the classroom. Then came quarantine and from that time until now I have been sitting home all day, either playing call of duty or studying...

I moved again for my senior year to another area and school, i was both relived and stressed at the same time... I got to have a clean slate, again. But I don't know anyone and nobody knows me... Senior year has been online mostly and things haven't changed since junior year... I started getting social anxiety whenever i leave the house to buy groceries, limiting any kind of interaction with anybody.

Yesterday I told myself, enough... I have to try opening up and trying to talk to people. I heard about this app called Yubo that connects you to people around you in the area to chat with. So I went ahead download the app, setup an account, and there you have it... Dozens of people I can possibly talk to, dozens of possible friends you can make.

I clicked on a random stream with two girls and a guy, they were welcoming at first. The guy was flirting with the girls in a sexual way and wanted me to join in, I dodged his invitation in an attempt to have a normal conversation. He then went to my bio and started making fun of how I look, what I like, etc. I usually don't take criticism like this seriously, I laugh it off and move on. But this time the girls he was flirting with joined in to mock me. He then told me to leave the chat room and banned me from entering it.

After that moment I went ahead and deleted both the account and the app, then told myself ""never again""... Lately I feel rejected by society, by my family, all the people I've known throughout my life. And every morning I wake up to question my existence.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of isolation and disconnection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author describes a series of moves and transitions, each time having to leave behind established relationships and start anew. the loss of a long-term friendship upon moving to a new country and the subsequent social isolation at school are significant events that contribute to their sense of loneliness. the quarantine period exacerbates this isolation, as the author stops communicating with others and becomes the ""quiet kid"" in the classroom. the failed attempt to connect with new people through an app, resulting in mockery and rejection, further intensifies their feelings of being ostracized and unaccepted. the narrative concludes with a profound sense of rejection from society and loved ones, and the author questions their own existence, all of which are strong indicators of experiencing loneliness."
"feeling empty and hollowI feel as if I??m lacking something in my life, things like human interaction and a feeling of belonging and love, a girlfriend. Although when I??m around others I??m shown that I??m not missing much. People tend to want to get drunk and high and stand around talking about themselves and trying to one up one another. Maybe it??s the people who I surround myself with, but I didn??t know they??d end up like this, since I??ve known them since middle school. But even now that I??m in college on my own in this dorm an hour away from home I haven??t made a decent connection either. It??s really hard to find someone who is actually interested in talking to me, or actually remember anything about me afterwards. I start to wonder if something is actually wrong with me or something, if I??m so strange that I repel others, but that??s just what my anxiety tells me in my darkest hours. As I get older I??ve learned that not everyone is going to get along and that there??s no such thing as being too strange or weird, everyone is their own person. I guess that my problem stemmed from social media, before I had that I was blissful and content with my life. I became envious of others watching them show their best selves. I??m starting to learn that people are just people who probably feel the same way as I, they just don??t show it, and my envy comes from me imagining that they live a life without problems as well.

Nearly every single person has a boyfriend/girlfriend and a social life, but then I'm over here lonely and depressed almost every single day. It hurts. No matter how hard I try to converse, people always scrub me aside because they have more important people to worry about. Who could blame them? I'm just a depressed teenager with nothing going on with their life. What's the point of going on?

Every day during lunch I'll sit at a table with my ""friend"", or classmate acquaintances, who probably will forget the fact that I exist the moment the dismissal bell rings. I never have someone who I can just relate to and converse with whenever I want to. After all, I'm not important, right?

I've started getting into bodybuilding to help fill the void that is my loneliness, but what's the point if I can't even show anyone? What am I going to get? Just a few compliments from people who will forget about me in the next second?

I can't even talk to my family about this because I'm too embarrassed. I know they don't care. ""Stop being a baby and make friends"". Yeah, not so easy when you're sad about all the bullshit and scared all the time. What's the point of telling them if all that I'll do is make shit worse. All that will happen is they'll punish me and give me a lecture.

What do I do? Oh, and don't give me that bullshit saying ""oh, it'll get better"" because it probably won't. Not at the rate I'm going anyway. Don't suggest that I flush money to a therapist also. That won't help and it'll spark the whole family bullshit.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and hopelessness typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness. the writer expresses feelings of being overlooked and insignificant, both in their social interactions and within their family. phrases like ""lonely and depressed almost every single day"" and ""people always scrub me aside"" highlight the chronic nature of their isolation. the mention of feeling like a ""depressed nobody"" and the perception that others have ""more important people to worry about"" further underscore their belief that they are unimportant and disconnected from those around them. the writer's attempt to find solace in bodybuilding, only to dismiss it as futile because there's no one to share it with, illustrates their struggle to find meaningful connections or validation. additionally, the inability to confide in family due to fear of judgment or punishment exacerbates their sense of loneliness, making them feel trapped and misunderstood. overall, the narrative paints a vivid picture of a person engulfed in loneliness, struggling to find a sense of belonging or support in their life."
On the verge of self harmNot like anyone cares. I'm just so fucking lonely.,1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the mention of being ""on the verge of self harm"" suggests a deep level of despair and a lack of perceived support from others. the statement ""not like anyone cares"" highlights a feeling of being overlooked or ignored, which is a common experience among those who feel lonely. the explicit declaration of being ""so fucking lonely"" directly conveys the individual's emotional state, leaving no ambiguity about their feelings. these elements collectively underscore the severity of the loneliness being experienced, as the person feels disconnected, unsupported, and deeply troubled."
Started traveling but feeling lonelySo somebody told me it was very easy to meet people while traveling so i went and did that but i don??t know how to talk to people. Makes me feel even lonelier...,1,"the narrative reflects feelings of loneliness through the writer's experiences and emotions. the individual mentions traveling, which is often perceived as a social activity that can alleviate loneliness. however, despite being in environments where meeting new people is possible, the writer struggles with initiating conversations and connecting with others. this difficulty in social interaction exacerbates their sense of isolation, as they explicitly state feeling ""even lonelier."" the lack of social skills or confidence in engaging with others is a common indicator of loneliness, as it hinders the formation of meaningful connections. the narrative also highlights a discrepancy between expectations and reality, where the anticipated social interactions during travel fail to materialize, leading to increased feelings of loneliness."
"I want to feel heardI feel like I??m just squeezed out of every conversation I could possibly have. I usually can??t tell what the conversation is about in a group, I??m not very good with words on a whim, nothing I care about is something anyone who wants to talk to me cares about, and everyone??s so busy all the time. And right now I??m just so lonely and out of options it hurts.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a desire to feel heard, suggesting a lack of meaningful interactions and validation in their life. they describe feeling excluded from conversations, which highlights a sense of being marginalized or ignored in social settings. the difficulty in keeping up with group discussions and the inability to find common interests with others further emphasize their social disconnect. the mention of everyone being busy suggests that they feel neglected or unimportant to those around them. the culmination of these feelings into a statement of acute loneliness and pain underscores the profound emotional distress they are experiencing. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone struggling with significant loneliness."
"I know a lot of people......yet I spent the moment at 11:59 pm on new years eve alone in a parking lot. Not a single soul came up to me first via text or phone calls to wish me a happy new year. No one. It was me to reach out to as much people as possible. This kind of made me realize that people might appreciate me, but wouldnt miss me if wasnt here. I feel like i lost at life. I seriously just want to leave, i cant imagine living in that loop for another many many years",1,"the narrative reveals significant indicators of loneliness. the individual describes being alone in a parking lot during a traditionally social moment, new year's eve, which underscores a stark contrast between societal expectations and their reality. the absence of incoming messages or calls highlights a lack of social connection and reciprocation, leading to feelings of unimportance and invisibility. the person's proactive effort to reach out to others, only to realize their efforts are not mirrored, further exacerbates their sense of isolation. the statement about not being missed if they were gone reflects a deep-seated belief in their own dispensability and lack of value in others' lives. the narrative concludes with a profound sense of despair and hopelessness about the future, typical of someone experiencing chronic loneliness and its associated emotional burdens."
"ventI am lonely. And if I had someone, I'm so inexperienced that I just can't see it lasting.

I've had imaginary relationships. I guess I liked the hope I felt, that somehow there was this version of me that got the girl. The real life me just can't connect at all. 

I had all these imaginary conversations, all these daydreams full of love and hope and happiness to distract me from the scientific fact that none of this is true. 

Roughly a decade ago, I used to see a counsellor. She told me I had retreated within myself and kind of lost who I am. I never told her about these imaginary relationships. 

A couple years later, a girl who I was kind of into, said I was really hard to get to know. I don't let anyone in, I don't really share anything about myself with anyone because it's not worth the excruciating pain of rejection. I can't handle rejection, so I do nothing and remain bitter. 

I can't actually form a relationship with a girl. I really want to, but I don't have the capability, and lack the experience to build upon. 

Real women, aren't interested in me. And if they were, I wouldn't even recognise it.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of loneliness and isolation. the author expresses a clear sense of disconnection from others, highlighting an inability to form meaningful relationships. their reliance on imaginary relationships and daydreams as a coping mechanism indicates a significant lack of real-life social interactions and emotional connections. the mention of past counseling and feedback from others about being hard to get to know underscores a long-standing struggle with social engagement and self-expression. the fear of rejection is a central theme, leading to avoidance behaviors that perpetuate their loneliness. the narrative paints a picture of someone who desires connection but feels incapable and unworthy, which are classic indicators of loneliness."
"Upside DownOn monday my whole life flipped upside down, I headed to my parents for three days leaving behind my boyfriend, my apartment and my dog. I thought by leaving I was giving him the space that he asked for but on Tuesday night I got the call that it was over. He said that he cant try anymore, he says that he loves me but if we met 5 years later it would of worked but right now it just cant. We have 2 months to move everything out and I cant bare to be at the apartment. I miss my dog and hes trying to let me see her but I know it's hard for him to also see me (likewise). I just wish things were fixable, I keep thinking that this is just some sick dream that I'll wake up from. Where do I go from here? I isolated myself when I was with him because he was my bestfriend and i honestly thought i didnt need anyone else. Now I'm 23, living at my parents with an apartment im still paying for even though neither of us can stay there because it hurts. I've been having a lot of job interviews and I'm hoping that once I get something permanent than it can atleast take my mind off things but as of now I just feel like a loner and a huge disappointment. This isn't what I thought my life would become.. I thought I was going to marry this man.. I still think that we could. Not to mention my dog was my world but I know that they have a better connection so I was trying to be the mature one and to think about what would be best for her. 

I dont know what's more pathetic, me moving back home or me still thinking I have a chance. I'm not even sure if I'm looking for a response... I just dont know anything.",1,"the narrative describes a profound sense of loss and disorientation following the end of a significant romantic relationship. the individual expresses feelings of isolation and displacement, having left behind their apartment, dog, and boyfriend. the breakup has left them questioning their future and their own self-worth, evident in their statement about feeling like a loner and a huge disappointment. they mention isolating themselves during the relationship, relying heavily on their partner for emotional support, which has now left them without a support system. their longing for reconciliation and the emotional pain of not being able to see their dog further underscore their loneliness. they also express uncertainty about their future, both personally and professionally, and a deep sense of regret and confusion about their current situation. these elements collectively indicate a strong sense of loneliness and emotional turmoil."

"Any other lonely people out there tonight?Here I am again. Home alone with no one to talk to. Abusive parents who only. Contact me when they need something. A brother who is very similar, stupidly reached out to him to be told I was pathetic. A few friends but when I tell them how I feel I get the ""sorry to hear that"" or ""hope you feel better soon"".

I'm just fed up. Of the loneliness, having no one that cares but always being there when people need me. I'm fed up of being shit on in life. I just wish I had someone to give me a hug, tell me it's all going to be okay.

So to all those out there tonight, looking through reddit to see similar people, in similar situations hoping to find something to make them feel better just know.... I'm with you. It hurts.

"My progress is going so slow, I wish I had more energyDon't get me wrong I am very grateful for where I am now, it is already much better than 2 years ago when I didn't speak to anyone. I am not alone now but just feel so soul crushingly lonely. All day I yearn to call or talk to my friends but when I get the chance to I often don't take it. And when calling I feel so anxious I'm shaking all the time and can't speak normally often. It just feels so pathetic to know that I can pretty easily 'safe' myself but I can't reach it. Why do I give up on everything and everyone?

"Loneliness is permanentI think I'm meant to be alone. My circumstances and life's choices. I live in a small town with my family since covid hit. I graduated college with no job so I'm stuck at home for a while. I try my best to use this time to do productive things and look at the brighter side but ig it's hard. I don't have a social life and whenever I feel lonely I talk to strangers online. I don't mind the sex talk because it takes away my mind from feeling lonely for a while. I have been lurking on this subreddit for a month. I have had a short term relationship with a guy who dumped me during lockdown so he could have wherever he lived. I don't judge him.

"I just spent over $200 on various dating apps and websites due to my lonlinessOver the past year and a half or so, I (23 M) have been living in a city that is absolutely terrible for my dating life. It's frustrating because I have seen myself do better in other areas like college towns and bigger cities. However, where I currently reside, I am not marketable. I have only been on 2 honest dates with one woman here, but that is far outnumbered by the amount of times I have had to pay for dates in this area. I recently binged and bought subscriptions to various dating apps including Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and Ashley Madison (I am single and am not looking to homewreck, though), totaling at well over $200.

I don't know what's worse: the fact that this is not the first time I've done this in the past year, the fact that I can only find companionship in this area if I pay for it, or the fact that I know that I just wasted money because I know from experience that throwing money at the situation in this area doesn't help in the slightest. 

I would like to state that I don't feel depressed, but if my loneliness goes unchecked for so much longer, well, I just don't know.

"Normally I'm ok with itNormally I'm ok with being all alone and noone to really talk to sure its nice to have someone check on me like I do for some people. But today it's kinda upsetting me because well I'm not ok and I know it's never obvious when I'm upset. I just wish I had someone who would help me not be alone in my head sometimes. Usually I'm pretty good at handling myself and problems but I never can really talk to anyone about it. I don't want to burden the one I love because she's working on her own thing and I don't want to burden my friends because I'm always seen as the happier out of us.

I'm going over how I can help ease it myself because well that's the only person who's really never left, given up on me, or understands at this point. It's just so exhausting, putting on a face for people when I all I do after work is game, cry or go to the gym to fix myself for the next day. I fear I'm going to die alone not by my own hand but just in the end and that makes me hate myself a bit for fearing something so trivial I feel.

"A Legacy of LonelinessI??m sure many of you here can relate to this. My entire life has been and endless cycle of getting my hopes up, being rejected, and falling into loneliness. People seem to enjoy my company for the most part, but I??m never anyone??s first priority. I don??t get invited to anything by anyone or have many interactions outside of school. From the fourth grade to the tenth grade, I??d always try to hang around groups of people at lunch period, futilely attempting to force myself into the group. While I may have spent my time with these people, I was never really part of the group or considered to be by the people of it. I always had one friend who was one of the ??popular kids?? who has since changed schools and really shown a lack of interest in me. He was the one person I could always rely on to be around with at lunch time, and now that he left, I really have nothing. This was the final nail in the coffin. I??ve tried to force my way into too many groups, and I??ve since quit trying. Every new school year I would tell myself, ??This year people will like you and you??ll have lots of friends??. However, when I went into the eleventh grade, I already had accepted that no group would include me. So, I spent my entire eleventh grade hanging around my new best friend: my locker. I??m honestly a person people enjoy being around and I can make people laugh but no one seems to really care about that or about anything that has to do with me. As for the romantic side of my loneliness, there have been four women who I have had a particular fondness for. As you can probably guess, they all rejected me. All of these women showed at some point an interest in me, but ended up rejecting me in the end. I??m not the type of person to like many women, I really only develop a fondness for a select few. Of course I??m attracted to many women, but not in ways where I??d want to really be in serious relationships with them. However, every time I attempt to have a relationship with a woman, I get rejected. I??ve been told that I have to learn to love myself before I love others but that is not the issue. I am by no means depressed; I??m not the type of person to get depressed. In fact, I really do love myself and I??m the best friend I??ll ever have. The issue is that no one seems to love me. I honestly despise the human need for relationship. If I could not have to worry about creating relationships, my life would be a lot easier. But, this loneliness I??ve experienced my entire life eats away at my core. I??ve just experienced my fourth rejection from a woman I grew very fond of, and it feels like she??s ripped out the last piece of my heart I had to give out to someone. I??ve given out my heart, but received none back. This has left me empty inside, like a hole developed in my stomach. Before this most recent rejection, I can??t remember the last time I had cried from emotional or physical pain. It??s not that I was holding it in, I just really am not the person who cries a lot. Recently, I??ve been crying a lot more, and have accepted that I will likely not find many people, or anyone, who I will have a meaningful relationship with. As I enter my last year of high school, I am immensely excited to leave for University and meet a fresh new set of people. I can only pray that someone there has a connection with me and we can grow a relationship. Humans are humans though, and their need for relationships has really torn me apart.",1,"the narrative vividly describes a profound sense of isolation and rejection that has permeated the author's life. key indicators of loneliness include the repeated cycles of high hopes followed by rejection, and the feeling of being on the periphery of social groups despite efforts to integrate. the author mentions a significant reliance on a single friend, whose departure exacerbates the sense of isolation. the narrative also highlights the absence of meaningful relationships outside of school and the lack of romantic success, leading to feelings of emptiness and despair. the author’s lament about the human need for relationships further underscores their struggle with loneliness, as it is something they find burdensome yet inescapable. the emotional toll of these experiences is evident in the increased frequency of crying and the sense of emptiness described. despite a self-professed love for themselves, the author feels unloved by others, which is a common theme in experiences of loneliness. the anticipation of university as a potential escape and hope for new connections also reflects a deep desire for meaningful relationships that have been lacking thus far. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that are typical indicators of loneliness, such as social rejection, emotional pain, and a yearning for connection."
"I wanted to turn my back on my old life, including friends real or fakeI am a little weird. I have a sordid past but I also have degrees from prestigious schools, a decent job, and I am married (again). I wanted to separate myself from my past which  was a lot of alcohol, drugs, crime, and I don't know how else to put it but just being obsessed with sex and finding new partners. I decided one day to turn my back on my past as much as possible, including these ""friends""  and to get off most social media. I am glad because a lot of those people were fake and just wanted me for something (drugs, sex, entertainment). I have more peace of mind now. 

But I don't have any friends around me anymore. I don't want to talk to some who are not bad because I am so ashamed of how I used to be. I want to meet new friends, at 36, who are my friends and not just friends of my wife's or whatever. But I do not know where to start. I don't know where to start. Should I just forget about it and focus on my job and self improvement (I am starting to try to get into shape)",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a desire to disconnect from their past, including friends, which has resulted in a significant reduction of social interactions. the decision to turn away from social media and old acquaintances, despite gaining peace of mind, has left them without any friends around. feelings of shame about their past prevent them from reaching out to people who are not inherently bad, further isolating them. the repeated mention of not knowing where to start in forming new friendships at the age of 36 highlights their struggle and sense of isolation. additionally, the narrative's focus on self-improvement and job as potential substitutes for social connections underscores a sense of loneliness and the difficulty in forming meaningful relationships. these elements collectively illustrate the author's experience of loneliness and the psychological barriers they face in overcoming it."
"Can anyone relate?I feel so lonely. People often rly like me when they first meet me, but once someone rly gets to know me and talks to me for a while, they get bored and annoyed and they leave. I feel so unloved in this world and alone. I can??t help but think that there is something wrong with me. I am also so awkward and shy around new people. I feel that they automatically hate me, probably because of my looks, but I think this is in my head. It makes me super shy and unfriendly, but I think I have a reason to feel this way because people always leave. Afterall, nobody wants to be around someone who is sad.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and self-doubt. the individual expresses feelings of being unloved and alone, which are core indicators of loneliness. they mention a recurring pattern where initial social interactions seem positive, but over time, people grow bored and leave, reinforcing their sense of abandonment. the person's self-perception is also negative, as they believe there is something inherently wrong with them and that others dislike them based on their looks and awkwardness. this self-critical view further exacerbates their loneliness, as it leads to shyness and unfriendliness, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where their behavior might push others away. the belief that nobody wants to be around someone who is sad highlights their internal struggle and the impact of their loneliness on their social interactions."
"Channels of connection slowly breaking downFeeling low, one of my best friends once told me no matter what happened at home or between us there will always be channels for us to remain close through. Recently those have been disappearing rather quickly and I'm wondering if I'm just being outed...",1,"the narrative reveals a sense of disconnection and loss, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual describes the gradual breakdown of channels of connection, highlighting a significant change in their social interactions. the mention of feeling low suggests an emotional response to this disintegration, pointing to an internal struggle. the reference to a best friend's reassurance that they would always remain close, juxtaposed with the current reality of those channels disappearing, underscores a sense of abandonment and exclusion. the individual's wonderment about being outed indicates a fear of social rejection and isolation, which are core elements of loneliness. these aspects collectively paint a picture of someone grappling with the painful experience of losing meaningful relationships and feeling increasingly isolated."
"It's getting harder to want to even wake upI recently moved up to a new city and am finding it so hard to connect with anyone. I already felt like I had no one back home; heck, I even had to part ways with an ex because I was going to be moving and that still pains me. 

People will say to go get hobbies or try to go to meet up groups, but everything feels so forced. 

I've given up on trying to even make friends. I plan on just going to work and then coming home to sleep. Everytime I try to make any friend, it never lasts or it just feels so unreal.

I never wanted to live this long anyway. 
This lonliness is making it harder each day.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and despair. the individual describes significant difficulty in forming meaningful connections after moving to a new city, exacerbating an already present feeling of having no one back home. the pain of parting with an ex adds to the emotional burden, highlighting a lingering sense of loss. suggestions from others to engage in hobbies or social groups feel ineffective and forced, leading to a sense of futility in attempts to build new relationships. the person's resignation to a routine of work and sleep, coupled with a sense of unreal or transient friendships, underscores a profound sense of disconnection. the expression of not wanting to live long further indicates severe emotional distress and a pervasive feeling of loneliness that impacts their daily life and overall outlook."
"Lost my online and offline friends, all in the course of 2 days.Where do I go from here? I??m alone now, sitting in my room on the hopeless verge of depression.",1,"the narrative describes a sudden and significant loss of social connections, both online and offline, within a very short timeframe, which is a common indicator of loneliness. the individual explicitly states feeling alone and is physically isolated, sitting in their room. the mention of being on the ""hopeless verge of depression"" suggests a deep emotional impact from the loss of friendships, highlighting feelings of abandonment and despair. these expressions of solitude, lack of support, and emotional distress are typical signs of loneliness, as the person is struggling to cope with the abrupt change in their social environment and is experiencing a profound sense of isolation."
"No FriendsI have been in lockdown for about a year now and my school makes us use zoom. In zoom they don??t allow us to talk at all or chat to anyone so I have felt so lonely and in my state we can only go to places where we have to go to or we are arrested, so I haven??t seen my friends in over a year and I really have no friends, the one I have is a family friend. I have felt really lonely for a while and keep feeling more and more sad and I am on the brink of going into mania because I really can??t control my emotions anymore now because of me having no social interactions and not talking to a person my age or anyone besides my parents in a year, but I still try to be happy and I will keep trying to and I will keep trying to be happy and so should all who read this post, everyone who reads this, keep your head up because the world will be better some day and the pandemic will be over.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. the author describes a prolonged period of lockdown, during which they have had minimal social interaction, limited to virtual classes where communication is restricted. the lack of in-person contact with peers and the inability to engage in normal social activities are highlighted as significant stressors. the mention of not having seen friends for over a year and having only one family friend underscores the depth of their social isolation. feelings of sadness and loneliness are explicitly stated, along with a sense of escalating emotional instability, indicating a severe impact on their mental health. despite these challenges, the author expresses a determined effort to maintain a positive outlook, which suggests a resilience but also highlights the struggle they face. the narrative's focus on the absence of social connections and the resulting emotional toll are clear indicators of loneliness."
":(I think I am currently at one of my lowest. So low that I just searched for lonely in reddit and this subreddit actually pops up. I doubt I??d go back to this but I think I am at my limit. I don??t even know if venting is allowed here. Really sorry.

If someone was to look at my situation from an external point of view, they would say well you??re surrounded by people you love. Lucky me. But I don??t really feel that way. I am sorry for feeling ungrateful but sometimes I feel like I literally have no one to talk to. All I do in my entire life is listen to people, to their stories, and eventually think that we become closer or our overall relationship is going well. They think I??m very open and approachable, but in the end it??s only them who actually said and shared something. I think I was just trained well to respond appropriately and at the right timing. Don??t get me wrong, I actually really listen sincerely as I can feel that they need that kind of someone. But no one really tried to you know, actually talk with me. I sometimes start to talk about me but in the end the topic switches, the person shows disinterest, etc. I feel like a vial wherein people just pour their everything. Their rants, their vents in life, their complaints, etc. I just want to empty it all out somewhere. 
In the end, I just wish someone would actually talk to me, like really talk with me in a two way conversation, where they??re both genuinely interested in whatever the other is saying. Is this really hard to ask for? Or am I just an unlucky person that even asking is too much?",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and emotional disconnection despite being surrounded by loved ones. the author feels like a vessel for others' emotions but lacks reciprocation and genuine engagement in conversations. they describe a pattern where their attempts to share are met with disinterest, reinforcing their loneliness. this mismatch between external perception and internal experience is a common indicator of loneliness. the yearning for meaningful, two-way communication underscores their deep need for emotional connection and validation, typical of someone experiencing loneliness."
"I want my fantasies to come true.My fantasies are just me being social. I struggled with being social since I could remember and I depend on others talking to me for a social life. I've tried talking to people but no words come out of my mouth and it feels like I'm being chained to one place. When I do manage to get some words out, i'll either stutter, be so quiet no one hears me or I do manage to talk properly but get ignored. I feel like such a loser sometimes. Like I was born inferior. Life is unfair. It really is. I'm not even important enough to be properly gendered. I've said multiple times my pronouns are they/it but everyone uses she/her like it's nothing.

I really want to talk about astrology with someone during recess. Astrology is a huge interest of mine. However, everytime my friends talk about astrology it's without me. I have tried joining in but I get ignored. It hurts so bad. It feels like my flame for astrology is showly dying. All because I don't have someone to talk about it with. It hurts when they talk about it without me. They have the rights too. But I wish they'd let me talk about it with them. 

If I could get two wishes, i'd wish to be properly gendered and to have someone to talk about astrology with during recess who won't leave me.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and unfulfilled social desires. the individual expresses a deep longing for social interaction and connection, particularly around their interest in astrology. their struggles with initiating conversations and being heard highlight feelings of social inadequacy and exclusion. the repeated experiences of being ignored or misgendered contribute to a sense of worthlessness and invisibility. the pain of not being included in discussions about a passion of theirs exacerbates their loneliness. the desire for simple social acknowledgment and validation underscores the emotional distress and longing for meaningful human connection. these elements collectively indicate a person grappling with significant loneliness and a yearning for acceptance and companionship."
"Why does nobody talk to me, no matter what I say or do? I feel like I??m cursed or something wrong is with me, about to just delete social media swear no body actually cares about me.If someone does message me they usually just don??t seem to interested in talking to me or just end up ignoring me or I well just ignore them since I know they don??t even want to talk to me.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and a belief that others are disinterested in forming connections with the author. phrases like ""why does nobody talk to me"" and ""i feel like i’m cursed"" highlight feelings of being fundamentally unworthy of social interaction. the consideration of deleting social media underscores a desire to withdraw from social spaces due to perceived neglect and lack of genuine engagement. the author’s observation that messages are often ignored or that they themselves ignore others because they assume disinterest suggests a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy, where the expectation of rejection leads to behaviors that perpetuate loneliness. these elements are classic indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a deep-seated perception of social rejection and emotional disconnection from others."

\----

you guys call me a low-maintenance friend, which i totally agree with. i can be AWOL for months but when you need someone to talk to, i'm all ears. it's because i like having space and privacy. i enjoy solitude so much. but not always. i still want to be part of your life. not only when you feel sad or depressed, not only when you need help or advice, not only as your fill-in friend. 

when you sent that discord server invite in our groupchat, i immediately joined, assuming i'm welcome since i got the invite. it turned out to be a study server for our friends back in senior high. i was so thankful for that since i literally made no friends since college started one and a half month ago. i thought that it would help me so much so i wouldnt feel like im going through uni alone. 

during the first video call, you guys were so happy to talk to me again. but i'd like to believe i was much happier. that was a very rough week. i was so stressed, but it was a friday, and i waited all day since you, the one who made the server, said that you guys would study by 10 pm. I joined, and it honestly made my day, my week even. the only bad thing about it is it only lasted for like 2 hours. i understand that the purpose was to study, and not actually hang out. but the small talks and some jokes that were thrown during that call, i felt left out. i didn;t actually relate. obviously it's something i missed during my awol.

the next video call, i didnt have a heads-up. it was also a friday night, another hell week. around 10:30 pm i saw all of you in the call, no mics muted. i got excited because one of them wasn't present last time. i joined so fast, without letting you know through the chat first. i joined even if i had an essay to be passed before 12 am. i joined even if i had to cram the essay. but i didnt regret that. because those calls are the only way for me to reconnect with real people. with my friends. you guys were happy again. we talked and joked a lot. but mostly inside jokes. your inside jokes. i realized what was happenning. i tried to just listen and observe on your conversations --- while doing my essay. i then confirmed that all of you, in the server, are in a groupchat. a groupchat i never knew about. a groupchat i was never invited in. but i thought, that's not too bad right? i still got the invite for the server. maybe theyre just doing that since i was awol. and maybe they thought i dont want to join anyway. 

i asked you guys how long you will stay in the channel, you said maybe for another hour. i said you guys stay and i'll come back since i have to focus on the essay which i have to pass in like 15 minutes. after i came submitted it, i came back and all of you were gone. no chats or something. am i still part of our friendship?

last friday, as expected, all of you are on the call again. you guys knew i was online. you guys knew that if you were to message me, i'd answer right away. but i didnt know about it again. convinced myself that wait, maybe that was a coincidence, one randomly joined in the voice channel to just study by themself then another one saw and then joined and so on. but come on. those calls were scheduled. they planned it and talked about it. in that groupchat. that's why i was never notified. it was a really sad week for me.

that morning i messaged you, inviting you once again to play with me, along with our other friends. you said you'd love to when you get less busy. which i totally understand. we're all in college now, i understand that. but it's just... idk. during that conversation, i joked about how i felt like i don't have friends. how i wanna play a multiplayer game for example, and that i already have the game, now i just need friends. i always tell you about my day, how i still have no friends. i always tell you how i wanted to hang out with you guys again. and you know theyre genuine.

i'm sure you can tell when im excited or not. i'm always excited to talk to you. to talk in our now dead groupchat. i send a lots of blocks of messages. i spam texts and pics. i sent voicemails when telling a story, a very unfiltered one because you guys know how i never finish one story, since i always jump to another. that's how happy i am to talk to you guys. that's how much i want to feel connected. 

was i supposed to be in the discord server? or you just sent the invite in the groupchat since everyone in there is in the new groupchat except me, and hence would be easier?

i feel really left out. i like being alone but i don't wanna be lonely. i tell you how my junior high friends don't talk to me anymore. literally none of them. maybe they're busy, since again, we're in college now. or maybe because i dont reach out. you know i do. i message you guys, and the replies are just... dry. i dont feel the chemistry in our friendship anymore. you guys tell me you miss me, but i approached you, and every reply you make feel forced. like you just want the conversation to end. not to mention during those times you guys had a videocall.

now in college, it's just so hard to make friends. i honestly dont know why. is it because i lack in social skills? i tried to make some, but it seem like theyre only interested in finishing the group task and nothing else. 

in movies and soap operas, i used to laugh at how they exaggerate in portraying lonely characters. now i understand that it is indeed the real life. i dont wanna be like this. i've done some bad stuff and im not perfect, but i dont think im a bad friend. i just dont understand.

i stayed online in discord last friday, waiting because maybe you guys would notice me and maybe ping me. but i got nothing. i was so sad and wanted to talk to someone so bad, partly horny. so i went online to meet people. i met a guy, agreed to be in a **voice**call to do.. stuff. i agreed. i needed that. i was craving for any other interaction. it was just a bonus that he had a really good voice and had a great way with words. apart from the intimate stuff, what made me so attached to him is that he's so caring and... maybe i felt a connection? my heart was so happy the whole time we were in a call. we didnt just do it. we stayed on the call and talked about life, like new classmates meeting and getting to know each other. it was bare minimum. but i've been craving for that so bad. 

he even said he wouldnt just stick for a month, there will be other times. and of course, i know that's not true. that's the case with doing that shit. going online to meet horny people. they'll only be good for one time. the first and last time. it was good, it was fun, it was lovely, he made me feel human again. he made me feel.. important and seen? it's just sad and concerning that i got attached so easily. it's scary how i depend my happiness on other people. and it's depressing that we wont be talking again. and maybe i might not find someone who would make me feel things like how he does.

"This quarantining, lockdown shit hasn??t changed my life a bit.I never talked to anyone anyways, never hung out with anyone. Never even went near someone unless forced to.

Real loneliness is when even if everything went back to normal, people would still be forced to be away from you.

"i just want companyI left high school two years ago from now.   


I always felt lonely and isolated in general, so the feeling is not unfamiliar. I never felt like my connections were strong or that I was special to someone, BUT I had at the time (high school) a very strong group of friends I thought I would carry for the rest of my life. 

A few months later, after HS had ended, the pandemic started. I got to meet my friends a couple of times during last year but our distance was growing even before that year. Some of them started to date or were dating for years already and I watched myself slowly being deprioritized of their lives. That got me mad, and I'm still a little bit angry still even knowing that's just part of life sometimes.

Thing is, I got to a point last year where I was completely isolated, emotionally, mentaly, physically. My mental health which always was shakey and fragile took a down turn. (I believe I suffer from depression, but I never was officially diagnosed). At that time I had moved out from my mother's house ( which I'm back into btw) and I lived all alone for a couple of months. I had few text messages from time to time but I was getting lonelier and lonelier.

One year later from that time and here I'm. I literally have no one in my life right now appart from my mom, and she's honestly not the best company. I'm really tired of the isolation, one that started way before covid happened, an isolation which is rooted in childhood trauma. Trauma that changed my life and how I connect to people.

I also feel like I have no strength left in my body and mind to do anything for myself. I'm currently not working so I feel pretty useless and pointless right now, like my life has no meaning and goes nowhere. Outside pressures don't help a lot too. I can barely be self-sufficient and regulate my own emotions. 

I met a guy and he brought a lot of things that were boiling up in my mind already and that and many other realizations made me write this down. I feel worthless, desinteristing as I spent half of my life in my house, with no real friends, with people that didn't even care enough; alone. All of my family neglected me, people close to me died and of that led me to be very closed off, anxious and secretly starved for affection of any kind. He's the opposite of me.   


I'm not writing this so you can feel pitty for me, I consider myself a very resilient person. But yes, I'm exausted of livingthe hermit life.

"FA BBW. I'm basically doomed.So here I am,nearly 30 years old below average overweight female with no interests,no education,no job,no friends and a small son with problems. I'm basically doomed. Obviously I hit underiselability on all fronts,I can't even write a word correctly. I lack motivation,but I'm trying to lose weight on ketogenic diet,but what's the point anyway? I ruined my figure with obesity in my teens already,because of emotional, occasionally physical abuse, by the time I lost weight in my early 20s I was all flabby and disgusting. And what did I do,I stuck in abusive desperate relationships with another fa,who tried to trap me with my son, I left cause due all the abuse I ballooned up even more than in my teens. Now my body is truly ruined. U know what's below white fa men? Obese 300 pound females with small special needs children. And I'm not saying that to hurt men,thats what I have heard from them.And they are right,they shouldn't settle for my bullshit. Honestly even when I lose weight with keto,it's not gonna get better,I saw my face on photo when I was 140 pounds,I'm ugly,even back then I would only get desperate for sex type of attention. Haven't had friends in 12 years and those I had before that could hardly be called real friends. Still trying to figure out how to deal with my unpleasant past plus raising my son. I'm a bad mother,I'm too soft,I don't discipline enough cause in my childhood there's was too much of unnecessary strictness. I was a good child. Honestly the highlight of my day is to hide in my room and sleep. I can't handle mentally anything else. Anyway if anyone wants to chat respond with ur  discord in DM.",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of inadequacy, self-criticism, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness, all of which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual describes a lack of meaningful connections, both in terms of friendships and romantic relationships, and highlights a history of emotional and physical abuse that has contributed to their current state. the self-perception as ""doomed"" and the repeated emphasis on being undeserving or unworthy of better treatment are significant markers of loneliness. the mention of not having friends for over a decade and the reliance on the internet for potential interaction underscore the isolation felt. additionally, the person's struggle with self-esteem, body image issues, and the challenges of raising a child with special needs without a support system further amplify the sense of being alone. the narrative's tone, filled with despair and resignation, aligns with the psychological profile of someone experiencing profound loneliness."
Lonely -&gt; Not Lonely -&gt; LoneliestFor as long as can remember I've felt lonely even in a room crowded full of people. Then I meet someone who made me feel not so lonely anymore. Mine own issues started to show and they walked away. Now I'm lonelier than before. I just wish to say the fact that I wanted to be more then friends doesn't take away from the fact that now all I want is to be friends again.,1,"the narrative describes a persistent feeling of loneliness, even in the presence of others, which is a common indicator of chronic loneliness. the individual mentions meeting someone who temporarily alleviated their loneliness, suggesting a strong emotional reliance on this connection. the subsequent departure of this person led to an intensified feeling of loneliness, highlighting the depth of their emotional dependence and the impact of social rejection. the desire to revert to a state of friendship, despite unfulfilled romantic aspirations, underscores a longing for meaningful social bonds. these elements collectively illustrate the hallmarks of loneliness: a pervasive sense of isolation, emotional distress from lost connections, and a strong yearning for social intimacy."
"Being a parent is lonely....People always say that when you have kids you??ll never be alone again.

I guess that??s true in the sense that you??ve always got your kids, until they grow up that is.
The thing is though is that no one really talks about the fact that, while it??s amazing being a parent, it??s incredibly lonely. 

Friends you once had drift away when you have kids and they aren??t at that point in their lives yet. Going out is almost impossible, and even then the whole outing is usually spent worrying about the kids at home, did they brush their teeth? Are they behaving? Are they looking for mummy or daddy to tuck them in with a bedtime story? All these things make it feel like it??s easier to stay home.

Do other parents feel like this? Or is it just me?",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation that comes with parenthood. the author mentions how friends drift away once they have kids, highlighting a common experience of losing social connections during significant life changes. this loss of social interaction is a key indicator of loneliness. the author also describes the difficulty of going out, compounded by constant worry about their children, which limits their ability to engage in social activities and further exacerbates their sense of isolation. the rhetorical question at the end, asking if other parents feel the same way, underscores their feeling of being alone in their experience. these elements collectively point to the author's struggle with loneliness despite the constant presence of their children."
"I need to stop trying to make friends online.All it does is feed false hope.  I know that I will *never* have any lasting friendships, simply because of my personality.  I get upset, and then I burn down every friendship I have.  It feels satisfying, much like destroying a treasured material possession when very upset.  I just unfriended everyone who I was recently in contact with on Discord, but it's been months since I've had any close friends.  Some may call my incapability of lasting connection a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I don't think it is.  I've put so much effort into trying to make friends, much to no avail, and when I do find someone who I ""click"" with (which seems extraordinarily rare, by the way), the friendship seems to be inevitably doomed to end within a year.  When I get upset, I can't control it.  I can't make the hurt go away or even lessen it, and it makes me want to hurt people.  Even if I know that I'll regret it later, I'll push people away.  I've threatened to do some pretty mean things if I wasn't left alone permanently.  To be honest, it often feels like I've never had even one real friend.  People may interact with me so they can feel good about themselves (because at least they aren't me!) and/or because they'd feel guilty if I were to overdose and die, as there's probably a linear relationship between the likelihood of me ODing and how incredibly lonely I feel.  It angers me very much when seems like someone is just pretending to be my friend.  Anyway, I'm going to order some more diluted fentanyl powder on the darknet, it's been a while since I've had any, and maybe I'll die this time.  Things aren't going to get better.  I'm also incapable of genuine achievement, so I have nothing whatsoever to look forward to, and never will.  Everything even remotely ""positive"" about me is fraudulent in some way.  I'll always be a ""bad person"" by societal standards, and pretending to be someone I'm not in order to gain social acceptance would only make me feel even worse.  I wish I could be liked and valued for who I am, but that's nigh impossible considering what kind of person I am.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and despair, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a belief that they are incapable of forming lasting friendships due to their personality, and they describe a pattern of self-sabotage in relationships. this self-fulfilling prophecy is a common feature in those experiencing chronic loneliness, where the expectation of failure in social interactions leads to behaviors that ensure that outcome. the mention of unfriending everyone on discord and not having close friends for months underscores their social isolation. their comparison of destroying friendships to destroying treasured possessions when upset highlights a deep-seated anger and frustration, often associated with feelings of abandonment and rejection. the narrative also reveals a cycle of hurt and retaliation, pushing people away as a defense mechanism, which further exacerbates their loneliness. the contemplation of suicide and the ordering of fentanyl indicate a severe level of distress and hopelessness, common in individuals who feel profoundly disconnected and believe their situation will never improve. the desire to be liked and valued for who they are, coupled with the belief that this is impossible, illustrates a painful yearning for genuine connection and acceptance. all these elements together paint a picture of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness, struggling with the emotional pain it brings."
i??m like dying of lonelinessabout a year ago i thought everything was terrible and i had nothing left and that i was at rock bottom but oh boy was i wrong this is even worse anyways i just have no one to talk to or tell my problems to or anything all the good in my life has just gone my friends left me ages ago i??ve tried making new ones but no one seems to like me i guess i??m just too weird or something idk but i try my best to be a good friend but everyone just leaves and i literally can??t stand being alone all the time admittedly i do like being alone 24/7 but i also want to have someone to talk to about....well everything i just want a friend who loves and cares about me as much as i do them,1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and despair, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of having no one to confide in or share their problems with, highlighting a lack of social support. the mention of friends leaving and the difficulty in forming new relationships underscores a persistent struggle with social connections. phrases like ""dying of loneliness"" and ""rock bottom"" convey deep emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness. the contradiction of enjoying solitude yet yearning for companionship further emphasizes the complexity of their loneliness. the desire for a reciprocal, caring friendship indicates a fundamental human need for meaningful connections that remains unmet. these elements collectively paint a vivid picture of someone experiencing significant loneliness."
"Gah, emotions fricken suck (sometimes).I, like many of you, am lonely. I dont focus on it though, i pretend im not and it usually works out fairly well. But...these last 2 nights I've had these dreams. Not dirty dreams by any means, both dreams had the same recurring theme 


- First was a coworker, second was an old 'friend'. They put their head on my shoulder and fell asleep. Thats all it was. I remember how it felt, perhaps thats why when i wake up im so...lonely. 


I (23m) haven't gotten any friends left(except work 'friends'), i haven't had a relationship in over 2 years. The relationship i was in wasn't healthy for me, so id say i really haven't been in a true relationship. 


My childhood was completely dysfunctional. My family is dysfunctional, and growing around them has made me dysfunctional. I dont trust, nor can i talk to them about anything personal. I cant talk to anybody about anything personal. Except redditors. 


Being raised in a dysfunctional family presents its mental illnesses. Im socially anxious, mainly because i dont know how to respond in those environments. I very seldomly hung out with friends or went out. So to do so now would require social learning. Which I'm not against at all, i just feel i need somebody with me, that i trust. Nobody fits that criteria. 



Ill just end this here otherwise i could keep going. Loneliness fricken sucks. I really hope i stop having these dreams.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of loneliness through several key aspects. the author explicitly acknowledges their loneliness and describes efforts to ignore it, which highlights a struggle to cope with these feelings. the recurring dreams involving simple acts of intimacy, such as someone resting their head on the author's shoulder, underscore a deep yearning for connection and comfort. the author also mentions a lack of meaningful relationships, both in terms of friendships and romantic connections, which exacerbates their sense of isolation. the dysfunctional family background and resulting trust issues further isolate the individual, making it difficult for them to form new, supportive relationships. the mention of social anxiety and the need for someone trustworthy to help navigate social environments indicates a significant barrier to overcoming loneliness. overall, the narrative is filled with indicators of loneliness, including explicit statements of feeling lonely, dreams that reflect a desire for closeness, and descriptions of personal and social obstacles that contribute to their isolation."
"Getting too lonely latelyNo friends,no boyfriend,no fuck buddy.I need a hig badly..",1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of isolation and longing for human connection. phrases like ""getting too lonely lately"" and ""no friends, no boyfriend, no fuck buddy"" explicitly state the absence of social relationships and intimate connections, which are critical indicators of loneliness. the mention of needing a ""hug badly"" further underscores the deep craving for physical and emotional comfort. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness, as the individual explicitly acknowledges their lack of social support and their intense desire for contact and companionship. the language used conveys a sense of urgency and distress, typical of someone grappling with feelings of loneliness."

"I just want a friend18, going to community college where all my classes are on zoom and I have no friends. I wish I had someone who was in the same shoes as me to talk to because this is getting really hard for me. My depression is getting really bad and I??ve stopped working out or leaving the house unless it??s something urgent. For some reason I feel like I??m the only person going through this because it seems like from social media everyone seems to be making friends/having fun but me. I know social media is not an accurate portrayal of someone??s life, but it??s hard not to notice these things.",1,"the narrative describes a person struggling with a lack of social connections and a desire for companionship. the mention of attending community college via zoom and not having any friends highlights a sense of isolation. the individual expresses a wish for someone to share their experiences with, indicating a longing for social support. the worsening depression and the withdrawal from activities such as working out or leaving the house are significant indicators of loneliness. additionally, the feeling of being the only one struggling, exacerbated by comparisons to others on social media, reinforces the sense of disconnection and loneliness. these elements collectively point to an experience of profound loneliness."
I feel like a ghostI??m so lonely. Everyday I am ignored by so many people. It??s not myself. At least I don??t think. I??ve been in a rough spot but I feel pretty good about myself. Just don??t think anyone cares about me. Idk.,1,"the narrative exhibits several key indicators of loneliness. the writer explicitly states feeling like a ghost, which metaphorically suggests a sense of invisibility and disconnection from others. the repeated mention of being ignored by many people reinforces this feeling of social isolation. despite the writer's self-assessment of feeling good about themselves, the underlying sentiment of not believing anyone cares about them highlights a significant emotional void and lack of meaningful social interactions. the uncertainty and ambiguity expressed in phrases like ""idk"" and ""at least i don’t think"" further emphasize their internal struggle and confusion about their social worth and relationships. these elements collectively point to a profound experience of loneliness."
"Think I??ve hit Rock BottomI??ve been on a steady decline for the past year and a half at least. Fewer friends, family growing apart, that sort of thing. None of which I realized at first. I blamed it on other things. School??s too stressful, or once the fights between friends/family calm down I??ll feel better. All these excuses. Took me a while to realize how lonely I was getting

Then Quarantine hit. I lost all friends but two. And I had my family, one parent at a time at least. That??s it. And that was tough. But I still lit up every time I met up with my two friends. I took them for granted so much

Now I??m at college. I finally did it. I finally have no one in my life. Sure, I can call a parent, or those two friends I talked about. What??s the difference, I??m just spinning in my room all day long. Slowly meeting people here, but it??s not the same so far. 

I feel like I??m finally all by myself, and there??s no one, no way out (at least for a long while). Nothing. How I??d kill to meet up with one of my old friends one more time

Welp, now I just wait",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author describes a progressive decline in social connections over the past year and a half, with fewer friends and growing apart from family. this gradual realization of loneliness is compounded by the impact of quarantine, which further reduced their social circle to just two friends and sporadic contact with family. the author expresses a longing for past connections and a sense of being trapped in their current situation, likening it to being in prison. they mention the difficulty of forming new relationships in college and the lack of meaningful interactions, highlighting their feelings of being all alone with no immediate way out. this persistent yearning for companionship and the hopelessness about forming new bonds are classic symptoms of loneliness. the narrative is imbued with a sense of despair and resignation, further underscoring the author's profound sense of isolation."

Now i??m just trying to accept this loneliness to where it??ll be just a norm and this void feeling will be so normal that, that it would be all i know and i would be naive to it where i??m normal if that makes sense.",1,"the narrative expresses profound feelings of isolation and despair. the author mentions being consumed with loneliness and feeling that peace and happiness are unattainable, which are strong indicators of emotional distress and social isolation. the language used, such as ""i don't belong here"" and ""trying to accept this loneliness,"" suggests a deep sense of disconnection from others and a struggle to find meaning or connection in their life. the author also describes loneliness as a norm they are trying to accept, indicating a resignation to their situation and a lack of hope for change. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect a pervasive sense of being alone and disconnected from others, which can significantly impact mental health and well-being."
"I'm okay with being lonely now, I just wish I had friends before to make memories withI spent my ""best years"" playing video games 10 hours a day cause I had nothing else to do. It wasn't completely awful - you should do anything as long as you enjoy it, my problem is - I hear and see lots of stories about people having this one best friend they always hanged out with, for example the begging of ""Life is Strange 2"" or the song ""Death Bed"" and I start crying immediately.

 These were supposed to be years that I enjoyed the most throughout my entire life, years that I wouldn't forget even with dementia cause they were so good. But instead I sat in my room all day, not leaving even once. 0 friends, just games and me.

*I wasted it, the only thing I can't restore.*

And the worst thing is - I can't even change it, I'm not really sure what's wrong with me, but everytime I meet someone I immediately make them dislike me. I know there's a reason for it, but I don't see it, and nobody wants to tell me why. 

I just had to say this, get this out of me - cheaper than a therapy session, right?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of regret and longing for social connections that were never formed. the individual expresses a feeling of having wasted their formative years, which they spent in isolation playing video games. this sense of missed opportunities for meaningful relationships and shared experiences is a strong indicator of loneliness. the person mentions crying when they encounter stories about close friendships, highlighting their emotional response to the absence of such bonds in their own life. the repeated reference to having no friends and the difficulty in forming new relationships underscores a persistent struggle with loneliness. the narrative also reveals a sense of self-blame and confusion about why they repel others, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and contribute to a cycle of loneliness. overall, the combination of regret, emotional pain, and ongoing social difficulties are clear indicators of the individual's experience with loneliness."

"Why do I always have to text first to have any chance at social interaction?None of my family members or ""friends"" ever text me first. The only time they do is when they need something.

"Been lonely and without friends for so long now, it feels like when someone says ??Walk normal?? and you're super conscious about it except you're conscious about how you conduct yourself around othersSorry for the long title. But yeah, been without friends for about 8 years now, I'm 29. I've been in a relationship for a large majority of that time but I still feel very lonely a lot of the time not having just one friend. I can't seem to make a deep enough connection with people and honestly it's hard not to take it personally.

I do think that I've never really fit in anywhere, not exactly a social outcast but just never slotted in quite right either. It's got to the point that I'm super aware of how I might come across to people at work. I'm not in to any weird shit, I'm not controversial, I'm not inappropriate or anything like that. I get on really well with some people there and we have lots in common, it just never goes beyond work, even when I've tried to expand it to.

"Lonely after moving to collegeI just moved into university a few days ago. None of my friends from back home came to my college, so I'm starting off fresh. So far, I haven't made a single goddamn friend. I am so desperate for any form of friendship, but am seemingly incapable of approaching people. Seeing groups form so easily, hearing people laughing and having fun while I just walk around alone makes me feel worthless. Every second, I think about quitting and going back home. My anxiety has gone far above what I thought I was capable of, and I've been having constant intrusive thought of taking my own life. With every passing day, I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to ending it all. I just want someone to talk to. If anyone has any advice, that would be greatly appreciated.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and emotional distress. the individual describes feeling desperate for friendship and connection but struggles with the inability to approach others, which is a common symptom of social anxiety. the imagery of walking around alone while others form groups and have fun amplifies their sense of exclusion and worthlessness. the mention of intrusive thoughts and the consideration of ending their life are severe indicators of their deep loneliness and psychological turmoil. these feelings are exacerbated by the recent transition to a new environment, which can be a significant stressor and trigger for loneliness. the plea for advice and someone to talk to underscores their urgent need for social support and connection."

Feeling extra lonely tonight.just need somewhere to vent.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a desire for connection, which are key indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly states they have no friends, which suggests a lack of social support and meaningful relationships. the plea for someone to talk to and the mention of feeling ""extra lonely tonight"" highlights an acute awareness of their solitude and an urgent need for emotional support. the request for a place to vent further emphasizes their need for an outlet to express their feelings and be heard. these elements collectively underscore the individual's experience of loneliness, as they seek connection and understanding in the absence of a supportive social network."
"Not sure what to do.I could press on with life hoping that I can make it better by myself, or I could cast my net here and see if I can catch any other lonely people. Either way, I feel that I have no choice but to keep on living (since I'm not actively suicidal).

But I do feel my opportunities to connect with other human beings fading more and more as I get older (turning 32 in a couple months). Online dating seems to be stuck on near-impossible levels of difficulty. My friends have pretty much all fallen away, not entirely, but quite a bit. Even my own mother and father get kind of sick of talking to me. Check my (barely existent) post history for more from today, I guess, if you want.

"Nothing like a failed interview to remind you that you're lonelyI bombed a virtual interview yesterday morning, and I was fine until just an hour ago. Then my mind turned against me and I just broke down in tears. I don't even care about the job, I was just so disappointed in my performance in the interview.

I needed someone to speak to so I thought to call my brother who is probably my closest friend, and I still might but he has a toddler and his own mental health stuff going on. 

Who can I call? Maybe 3 acquaintances I last texted over a month ago. I've even managed to alienate wider family.

I like being social in small doses, but I can never keep friendships and I feel like that will sink me in the end. 

I want to do better, but I never learned the skill of maintaining relationships when you don't have to be physically close to them e.g. school/work friends.

Sorry, bit of a self-absorbed post but I had to share it.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of isolation and yearning for connection. the author describes a failed interview as a catalyst for their emotional breakdown, highlighting a moment of vulnerability and self-criticism. the need for someone to talk to is evident, yet the author struggles to find a suitable confidant due to their brother's preoccupations and their own distant relationships with acquaintances. the mention of alienating wider family and the difficulty in maintaining friendships underscores a recurring pattern of disconnection. the author's awareness of their social limitations and the desire to improve, coupled with the inability to sustain relationships outside of structured environments like school or work, further exemplifies their loneliness. the self-reflective tone and the apology for the ""self-absorbed post"" indicate a longing for understanding and empathy, typical indicators of someone experiencing loneliness."
"35M Being a loner is starting to feel painfulI lost a group of what I thought were friends several years ago. I've cycled through some friendships since then but realized they were meaningless. One of my closest friends moved to a different part of the country just because he wanted to, and another ""friend"" is my ex-therapist who I think started hanging out with me so he could have a place to smoke weed. And I have a feeling he's trying to distance himself slowly without trying to hurt me, although I'm kind of pissed at him (and myself) that he pursued a friendship in the first place. I live alone and enjoy it at times, but most of my days are spent not having a single conversation with anyone in person. I've never been an outgoing person, and I don't know how to meet new people. I'm also asexual, so it's not like a sex drive can help me connect with others either. I just feel like this will always be a struggle, and I'm tired of battling this. 

I'm not suicidal, but I'm just afraid that this will wear me down to that point someday.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and a struggle with maintaining meaningful connections. the author expresses feelings of loss and disappointment with past friendships, indicating a pattern of relationships that seem to lack depth or stability. the mention of a close friend moving away and another using the friendship for ulterior motives highlights a sense of betrayal and abandonment. living alone and spending most days without any in-person conversations further emphasizes the social isolation. the author's acknowledgment of their introverted nature and difficulty in meeting new people adds to the feeling of loneliness. additionally, the mention of being asexual and its impact on forming connections suggests another layer of complexity in their social interactions. the overall tone conveys a sense of hopelessness and fatigue in dealing with these ongoing struggles, with a fear of the potential long-term impact on their mental health."

My kids are great but at an age where they're only wanting to be with friends. I just feel lost. I dont have a bad life but I find myself almost constantly thinking of just ending it all.

Why am I this way?",1,"the narrative describes an individual who feels increasingly disconnected despite having a seemingly stable life with a family and a decent job. the writer mentions a lack of deep conversations with their spouse and a sense of isolation from their children, who prefer spending time with friends. this disconnection extends to their social and professional life, as they admit to distancing themselves from friends and coworkers. the individual's expression of feeling lost and their contemplation of ending their life are significant indicators of deep emotional distress and loneliness. their struggle with these feelings, alongside the mention of weight gain, suggests a lack of motivation and possible signs of depression. the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and a yearning for meaningful connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness."

Hopefully I could make friends that stick around for at least a year...",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of loneliness and the struggle to maintain meaningful connections. the individual mentions making friends online as a coping mechanism to alleviate their loneliness, indicating an active effort to combat their feelings of isolation. however, the transient nature of these friendships, as highlighted by the phrase ""are gone now, again,"" underscores a recurring cycle of forming and losing connections, which exacerbates their sense of loneliness. the repetition of the word ""lonely"" and the explicit statement ""feeling lonely, being lonely really does suck"" reflect the emotional weight and pervasive nature of their loneliness. the hope for future friendships that last longer reveals a yearning for stability and enduring social bonds, which is a common desire among those experiencing loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate the individual's ongoing battle with loneliness and their deep-seated need for lasting companionship."
"Need help making friendsI am a pretty chill, good to talk to guy, yet I struggle to make friends. Of the friends that I have, me being a 20 year old male in university, most are female. I struggle to make male friends. I wanna have a group of friends to call the ""boys"" and just hang out and do guy stuff with. even with the friends that I have, I am always the one making plans. I am never approached first or asked to hang out. I feel that if I stop approaching my ""friends"", I would just disappear and be completely alone.

Also, I would want to approach a group of guys I was vaguely acquaintances with in high school so I have friends in my home town too. I don't know how to just make friends and keep them. At home and in university. I am open to any advice or help you can offer.",1,"the narrative indicates feelings of loneliness through several key aspects. the individual expresses a desire to make more friends, particularly male friends, which suggests a lack of social connections that fulfill their needs. despite having some friends, the individual feels a sense of imbalance in the effort to maintain these relationships, as they are always the one initiating contact. this one-sided effort can lead to feelings of isolation and insignificance, as there is no reciprocation from the friends. the fear of disappearing if they stop making plans underscores a deep-seated anxiety about being alone and unimportant to others. the consideration of joining a fraternity and reconnecting with high school acquaintances reflects a proactive approach to combating loneliness, but also highlights the current dissatisfaction with their social life. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reveal an unmet need for meaningful, reciprocal connections and the emotional distress that accompanies this lack."
"I didn??t care about being lonely until I started workingSummer is here and school is out, so I got a summer job earlier this month to keep me busy. Before getting the job, I was content with being alone. I??d spend most of my time by myself watching movies, tv shows and listening to music. I was fine, I was happy. Then I started working and things changed. 

The group of people I??m working with are also students like me. We were all strangers coming into this place, but as the weeks went by, they slowly began socializing with each other. Negative thoughts crept up on me.  They made it look so easy. Making friends has never been easy for me. 

Yesterday was the worst day ever. It was a slow day so there wasn??t much to do. They were all talking to each other, laughing, and having a good time. Then there was me, an outcast, alone. My mind was filled with negative thoughts at this point. I started thinking that maybe there??s something wrong with me. Why was it easy for them but so hard for me? I was getting frustrated and angry seeing them like that. Then these feelings turned to sadness. I don??t want to feel this way anymore.",1,"the narrative provides several indicators that suggest feelings of loneliness. initially, the individual was content with solitude, engaging in solitary activities like watching movies and listening to music. however, upon starting a summer job, the person observed peers easily forming social connections, which triggered negative self-reflections and feelings of isolation. the stark contrast between the individual's social experience and that of their colleagues highlights a sense of exclusion. phrases like ""an outcast, alone"" and ""negative thoughts crept up on me"" underscore the internal struggle and self-doubt. the culmination of these emotions into frustration, anger, and sadness further illustrates a deepening sense of loneliness. these feelings are typical for someone experiencing loneliness, especially when juxtaposed with the seemingly effortless social interactions of others. the narrative's progression from contentment in solitude to distress in a social setting reflects the complex nature of loneliness and its impact on mental well-being."
"I just lost all my friendsThey were kinda shitty friends, actually, but they mere the only ones I had.

Don't even bother commenting that it's all in my head or it's my own attitude that's at fault. Let me vent in peace.",1,"the narrative vividly expresses intense feelings of isolation and despair, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the author mentions a profound sense of emptiness and a lack of meaningful connections, stating that nobody stays in their life for more than a day and that they have no one to talk to. the use of strong language and expressions of emotional pain, such as describing themselves as a ""lifeless soul trapped in a body,"" underscores the depth of their loneliness. the narrative also reflects a sense of hopelessness about forming relationships and a belief that others, even those who seem unworthy, have someone who cares for them. this comparison to others further exacerbates their feelings of loneliness and injustice. the dismissive tone towards potential comments about their attitude indicates a deep frustration and a desire to be understood rather than judged. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant loneliness and emotional distress."

I feel better with myself, and I have gain so much confidence these last months so I'm stronger than ever. But with covid and the break up I had to get back to my hometown close to my family. My mother is bipolar and she is stable now but she is extremely possessive and she still has some changing behaviours that I didn't miss.
She used to make suicidal attempt all the time when I was young. My brother will go to jail soon and they are talking about that all the time and I'm just fed up with this fucking dysfunctional family.

But in reality, I'm not, and I have forgotten myself too much for them. My therapist is really supportive about that. My friends are too, even if they are maybe a bit sad.

But what can I do? I'm so exhausted to wait and it's really lonely there. I have no problem with being alone, but I want to see new places, new faces, and live my life without these leeches. I don't know what to do because of the pandemic. I know that I can meet good people, but yes it's really lonely for the moment and I feel stuck. :(",1,"the narrative reveals a person grappling with feelings of loneliness amidst a backdrop of significant personal and familial challenges. despite the individual's recent strides in self-improvement and confidence, the narrative is steeped in a sense of isolation and frustration. the author describes being stuck in a small hometown, close to a dysfunctional family, which exacerbates feelings of being trapped and alone. the recounting of a toxic relationship and a challenging family environment, including a bipolar mother and a brother facing incarceration, adds layers of emotional strain. although the person expresses a strong desire to move and explore new places, the pandemic has thwarted these plans, intensifying the feeling of being stuck and lonely. the therapeutic journey and supportive friends provide some relief, yet the longing for change and the inability to act on it due to external circumstances underline the persistent sense of loneliness. the narrative's emotional tone, marked by moments of crying and exhaustion, further highlights the depth of the individual's loneliness, despite their outward confidence and resilience."

"Why is socializing so hardI??m an awkward person, not afraid to admit it. Starting a conversation with someone is not my strong suit. That being said I??m desperate for human interaction. To be completely honest I used to be quite an asshole to my peers in highschool. Won??t make any excuses as to why. I truly think I??m a changed person and have become someone who shows compassion towards others. But some of the things that I??ve done to others haunt me to this day. I can??t learn to forgive myself. Living in a relatively small community I??ve burnt too many bridges for me to be trusted by many people. I believe I don??t deserve affection in any shape or forum. So I??ve been an introvert for the last several years. It??s eating away at me. Having been diagnosed with clinical depression I??ve been known to be a downer around others, thus driving people away. I??m on a good combination of medications but they aren??t miracle drugs.

Asking for a friend.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses difficulty in socializing and a strong desire for human interaction, which are typical signs of loneliness. they also mention a history of negative behavior towards peers and the resulting guilt and self-punishment, which contributes to their isolation. living in a small community where they have burned bridges adds to their sense of being cut off from others. the person’s belief that they don’t deserve affection further highlights their internal struggle and loneliness. their introverted lifestyle and reliance on unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as excessive consumption of pornography and comfort food, are additional indicators of their loneliness. the diagnosis of clinical depression and the acknowledgment of being a downer around others reinforce the sense of social disconnection. overall, the narrative clearly depicts a person who is grappling with loneliness and its various psychological effects."
"I'm sick of itI've (18M) suffered from social anxiety my entire life, and last summer I started going to therapy for it. I'm better at making friends and I have a good number, probably the most since elementary where it's basically ""hey wanna be friends"" ""sure"" ""yay"" so that great but I'm just still feeling my same lonliness I've always had.
Never really had a girl to even call a friend really, so definitely never had a girlfriend.
It's sucks to cuz my older brother (by like 10 years who's kinda like a role model to me) has social anxiety as well but has had several girlfriends before my age and it just kinda throws salt in the wound, not that I'm mad but just kinda feel like a failure.
I've had crushes but never talked to them really and at this point I feel like I'm just making excuses like ""oh she sits to far away"" and whatnot.
I've thought of joining tinder but lots of people say it's mostly used for one night stands and I don't really care about sex or anything like that I just want a relationship.
Just kinda writing my thoughts on it. If you've come this far in reading thank you for taking the time. Any advice or comments? Anything is appreciated honestly.",1,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of ongoing loneliness despite recent improvements in social skills and friend-making. the author describes their struggle with social anxiety and how it has impacted their ability to form meaningful connections, particularly with the opposite sex. the comparison to an older brother who has had more success in relationships exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and failure. the author’s reflections on making excuses and feeling stuck, along with their desire for a genuine relationship rather than superficial encounters, highlight a longing for deeper emotional connections. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as the author feels isolated and unable to achieve the level of intimacy and companionship they desire. the narrative’s tone of resignation and plea for advice further underscores the author's sense of loneliness and the need for support."

No one.
Graduated high school at what cost? Lots but I done it anyway but I also feel empty in this accomplishment.
Days go on with irregularities nothing really changes like a prison cell or a new game start up in a campaign just the same things go on.
Couldn't keep close relationships even if I tried.
I got asked what's wrong with myself to be honest sadly I wouldn't know where to start.
Showers feel good but only for a short time like a good night's sleep but it gets monotonous.
I observe others quietly like a animal in a cage in the pet store curious on real human interaction but I'm stuck in a internal cage.
Purchased meaningless items to fill the void I don't consume I just try to find a filler for the black void of emptiness.
I was a young Chad but I broke like a 2x4 plank I thought I was made of iron but I was wrong.
Not a junkie seen enough to not consume or purchase anything of that nature.
I just want a way out or an escape but the wall is too high and the plane ticket is too expensive (figuritivly speaking).
Not everything is gold lined but bland or mundane here but I don't like making long posts or stories just something to say and you ever feel that whatever you do is ineffective or futile just could never find myself I got lost and never don't follow me I'm lost too it's a jungle.
Have a great one",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness and emptiness, evident through the author's description of their life as monotonous and prison-like. the lack of close relationships and the feeling of being trapped in an ""internal cage"" are significant indicators of loneliness. the metaphor of being a ""young chad"" who has broken down and the comparison to a caged animal observing others highlight a profound disconnection from social interactions and a longing for meaningful connections. the author’s mention of purchasing meaningless items to fill a void further illustrates attempts to cope with this emptiness, which is a common behavior among those experiencing loneliness. the overall tone of the narrative, with its emphasis on futility and a desire for escape, underscores a pervasive sense of isolation and despair."

Wtf?? Am i just not normal. What would you guys do in my situation? Like im in cafeteria right now sitting alone and drinking my tea and I am the only one who sits alone. I hate having no friends, I want to drop out again. Even the thought of sitting next to them and talking to them fucking scares me.",1,"the narrative reveals a strong sense of isolation and difficulty in social integration, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the writer describes an immediate comparison with a peer who effortlessly made friends, highlighting their own struggle with social anxiety. the use of phrases like ""couldn't even talk to anyone"" and ""am i just not normal"" suggests a deep-seated insecurity and self-doubt. the scene of sitting alone in the cafeteria, coupled with the explicit mention of hating having no friends and contemplating dropping out again, underscores a feeling of exclusion and despair. the fear of social interaction, as evidenced by the statement ""even the thought of sitting next to them and talking to them fucking scares me,"" further supports the presence of loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant emotional distress and a longing for social connection."
"I feel like I will always be an outsiderI think the last time I had a real, close friend was in grade school. Throughout grade school I had a few friends and one best friend, but that was the last and only time I felt a sense of belonging. I feel like I have been overlooked my whole life. I have always been the second choice or the backup to people. I feel like no one ever enjoys my company/likes me as much as I like them. Basically my life has just been filled with lots of unreciprocated love. I have always been a very socially awkward person, and it is really, really hard for me to open up to me and be myself around people. In high school, I had one really close friend but she transferred to a different school after sophomore year and we lost touch. For the last two years of high school, then, I joined this group of friends who were already really close, so I never really felt included or connected to anyone in the group and I was always the outsider/loner, only hanging out with these people at lunch and during school assemblies so I didn't have to go alone. In high school I would literally make sure to pack my lunches strategically so that I would have enough food to distract me from having to talk. If I ate to fast and finished my lunch before the lunch period was over, I would just sit in silence awkwardly at the table surrounded by these people who were alll talking to each other but not me. So basically high school was awful. In college, I was able to make two really good friends my freshman year, but I transferred to a different college seater my freshman year because I had really, really bad anxiety and couldn't handle being away from my family. I have no friends at my new school, because everyone already kind of had their groups by the time I got there. When I say that I literally don't have a single friend at this school, I mean that. 

I don't know what is wrong with me, but there are times where I am hanging out with people and I want so badly to contribute to the conversation and know exactly what I want to say, but there is this mental block that prevents me from saying anything. Like no matter how much I want to talk and open up, I just can't. I think the only people I have ever been truly comfortable around and have been able to be myself around are my family members. I have 3 siblings and we are all pretty close in age, so we are pretty close and hang out together a lot. I am also really close with my parents, so it is nice that I do have some people who I can't be myself around. However, I know that everyone else in my family will move on and find their people and eventually we won't be each others' priorities anymore, and I am worried about what that means for me because I have no one besides them. Literally no one. I have never had a boyfriend or even been in a talking stage. I've never even really talked to a guy before. I am just so ridiculously shy and awkward that It seems like it is impossible for me to open up and be myself around others. It always just feels so forced; it never feels naturally, no matter whether I am trying to form a friendship of a relationship. It just makes me sad because I really like myself and who I am by myself. I feel like I am a really cool person with a lot to offer, but I can't seem to overcome this block and form relationships/connections with anyone. I worry that I will be alone forever. I can't handle the thought of going through life with no friends and no significant other. I hate being alone and I am so lonely, but I don't even know how to form connections.",1,"the narrative is a poignant reflection of someone grappling with deep-seated feelings of isolation and social disconnection. the individual recounts a history of fleeting friendships, starting from grade school where they last felt a genuine sense of belonging. their struggle with social awkwardness and the difficulty in opening up to others is a recurring theme, evident from their strategic behavior in high school to avoid social interactions and their inability to form lasting connections in college. the narrative is marked by a sense of being perpetually overlooked and the pain of unreciprocated affection, which exacerbates their feelings of being an outsider. the person's reliance on family as their sole source of comfort highlights their lack of external social support, and their fear of losing even this connection underscores their profound loneliness. the expression of a mental block that prevents them from engaging in conversations, despite a desire to connect, further illustrates their social challenges. the narrative ends on a note of despair about their future prospects for companionship, encapsulating their deep-seated fear of enduring loneliness. these elements collectively point to a profound sense of isolation and a yearning for meaningful connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness."
"I wish there was actually no one around me physically, now I feel lonely and trapped around people I know and loved for several years.It??s not that I don??t have any friends. Lately I??ve been getting to know my friends whom I??ve known for some time when we were in high school and I hate some of them. They are rude and disrespectful, make fun of me to the point I lose my self confidence and my will to spend time with people. When I tell them how bad they make me feel they say ??women can??t take jokes,?? that I should be thankful because they see me as a close friend and it??s just friendly banter. The ??friendly banter?? consists of jokes telling how stupid I am, how I won??t get to go to the university of my dreams because ??I don??t have the potential and intelligence,?? jokes that make fun of women, jokes that make fun of the lgbt community, minorities and people with the same world view as me. (I??m an atheist in an otherwise Muslim country and half of them are conservative Muslims) All but one of them have started University except me, I??m trying for another year because I couldn??t make the score I had to make to go to one of the best medicine schools in our country, but I didn??t fail at all, It was just lower than what I expected from myself . I did better than some of them, even. 

Some of the jokes are indeed a little more on the friendlier side but it makes me feel really bad when someone ridicules me for every little thing I do and say. I was always a sensitive person but I could take jokes. I know I am not overreacting but still, they make me question myself as if I??m the one that??s overly sensitive and hard to be friends with. 

All of my best friends have moved. One of them went to a different country and two of them are living in another city. The three of us are in the same group, which sucks terribly because they came to our hometown rarely and for a short period of time. When they do, we all hang out together, both the people I want to see and the ones that bully me. I miss my friends a lot, the feeling is terrible. I want to do nothing but cry myself to sleep because of how lonely and misunderstood I feel. There are days I don??t talk to anyone besides the necessary ??please?? and ??thank you??s, including my mom and dad. One thing I was not prepared for is touch deprivation. Getting my eyebrows plugged at the salon feels incredible, even though the actual plugging part hurts like a bitch.

This is a wall of text that doesn??t wrap up, I know and I??m sorry. I needed to share how I feel but hate to bother people. Making a reddit post is like screaming to the void.

I wish I felt nothing for anyone.But I do. I love people so much who just do not care about me and holy shit is that a fucking nightmare to live in.

"i'm used to having no one but why does it still hurt so badmost of the time i can ignore the loneliness but sometimes i just break down. i'd give anything to have someone to spend time with and to love me as a person, even just a friend. i feel so pathetic lying here crying in bed",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and emotional pain, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a deep yearning for companionship and emotional connection, highlighting a desire for someone to spend time with and to love them. the statement about feeling pathetic while crying in bed underscores the intensity of their emotional distress. the mention of being used to having no one but still experiencing significant hurt suggests a chronic state of loneliness that occasionally becomes overwhelming. this longing for even a single friend or a loving relationship points to a fundamental human need for social bonds that is currently unmet in the author's life."

alone againafter 3 months of being together my gf broke up with me last night. I don??t even remember who I was before I met her. this was my first serious relationship and it crumbled away so quickly. she grew  very distant and isolated from me in the last few weeks and I probably emotionally drained her. my ears have been ringing ever since last night and when I??m not around anyone I just break down into tears. I know she??s still in love with me but she ended things bc of depression and her job and schoolwork. I put in so much fucking effort I put my entire heart into this relationship and it??s all fucking gone and I don??t know what to do with myself.I feel selfish and gross and I just want her back but I know it won??t ever be what it was. this was the first time I had been happy in over a year and it??s gone,1,"the narrative reveals profound emotional distress following the end of a significant relationship. the individual describes a deep sense of loss and identity confusion, as they cannot remember who they were before the relationship. the mention of feeling emotionally drained and experiencing physical symptoms like ringing ears and breaking down into tears when alone indicates intense emotional turmoil. the individual's feelings of being selfish and gross, alongside the yearning for the past relationship, underscore a deep-seated loneliness. the narrative reflects a struggle to cope with the void left by the breakup and highlights the importance of the relationship in their sense of happiness and well-being. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as the person grapples with the absence of a significant emotional connection and the impact on their mental state."
"The struggle for wanting to feel loved during nights of loneliness. Ive always struggled with relationships and i wanted to reach out to those who have a similar issue.

My last relationship was with someone who was not emotionally involved and did the bear minimum at the start then let it fade. I don??t think my appearance had anything to do with it?? at least i hoped not. Maybe it was my mental health struggles that he never cared to learn about?? or just simply got bored of me. Maybe I wasn??t as feminine.. i do struggle with gender a lot. Never felt woman enough or man enough..but thats a topic for another day.

I work a simple job at a bakery,which I appreciate but it does get out of hand dealing with hungry people. I dont have close friends because i push them away.. mostly due to the fact that i overthink and ruin things. I guess i got used to the loneliness and watching from the sidelines.. watching  strangers slowly fall in love while im out walking my dog. At least love exists but maybe im meant for loneliness. Thats a constant thought and maybe one day it??ll convince me that its true.

All i wanted was someone for myself . My own person that indulges in sweets and enjoys animals. Someone to keep me warm during the cold winters when im all shakey. Someone to play in the snow as if were children. Someone to have some firsts with?? ive never had a picnic before or went on a actual date. Someone to talk to for hours on end and be happy. Someone to hold me and tell me i mean something to them. I want to feel pure love for the first time in my life even if it risks experiencing heart break. Maybe then ill feel more alive.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep yearning for connection and love, underscoring a persistent struggle with loneliness. the author describes a history of challenging relationships, marked by emotional detachment from partners and a sense of unfulfillment. their reflections on personal insecurities, such as concerns about appearance, mental health, and gender identity, contribute to feelings of isolation. the mention of pushing friends away due to overthinking and self-sabotage further highlights the barriers to forming close connections. the vivid imagery of watching others fall in love while feeling sidelined and the desire for simple, intimate experiences like picnics and long conversations reveal a profound sense of longing and solitude. the narrative captures the essence of loneliness through the expression of unmet emotional needs and the persistent hope for a meaningful, loving relationship."
"The Void ReturnsThe loneliness I feel comes and goes, and I hate that it's here. It feels like a hole in my heart that sucks in everything positive, leaving me only with this feeling of loss despite never having had anyone to begin with. I can't just poof up a boyfriend, but nothing I do seems to be helping me deal with things.

What are some things you guys might do to help cope with this kind of stuff? How might you stave off these feelings for a while?",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of loneliness and emotional distress. the author describes the loneliness as a recurring void, likening it to a hole in the heart that consumes all positivity. this metaphor highlights the deep and pervasive nature of their emotional pain. the mention of feeling a loss despite never having had anyone indicates a longing for connection and companionship, a common indicator of loneliness. the author's frustration with their inability to magically create a romantic relationship and their plea for advice on coping mechanisms further underscore their struggle. the narrative's tone of helplessness and the search for ways to manage these feelings are clear signs of someone grappling with loneliness."
"33 m married, have a kid, have a good job, but not many close friends... sure gets lonely having no one to relate toHey,

First, I want to admit I have flaws??I can be crass, offensive, too political (left), braggy, judgmental. I made way too many anti-Trump posts that I think just annoyed my friends and pissed some of my family off without really accomplishing anything. Second I love  my wife, love my daughter and have a good job, just stress about job stability in this economy so overall my life is good??I don??t lack for anything and my family is great. However, I??m not really a super social guy and never had tons of friends (seeming less by the year). I??ll be in a conversation with people and say ??how are you and your wife or family?? and people will kinda talk past me. Even when my daughter was born I noticed a huge difference in the response from my friends vs my wife??s friends who seems more genuinely interested and excited. Maybe that??s a sexist thing? 

Anyways, after having a kid I??ve had a lot of weird mental energy, some anxiety, some just thoughts and reflections I??d like to share them with. I have a brother who I am somewhat close with but not someone I talk to a lot. Used to go to therapy for work related stress a few years back but didn??t really accomplish much and felt like it was mostly a rip off, although I did like my therapist.

Being realistic, do I just focus on my career and family or do I put more effort into making friends? Kinda feels hard with COVID-19... not really depressed per se, but definitely just wish I had closer or more friends to bounce ideas off of and talk about stocks and baseball. I have a few coworkers that I talk to about stuff but we??re not really friends outside the office/Slack... 

What to do? Is this normal for 33? I feel like people see me as kind of an asshole who is overly political so they avoid me. So I regret that... but it??s hard for me to shut up sometimes even if I know arguing over it changes no one??s mind. I guess I??m increasingly over discussing politics openly except on forums like reddit, otherwise there is too high a social cost. Most people simply don??t care.

Beyond that, when I moved to college I didn??t keep in contact with my high school friends except maybe a few, same in college didn??t ever build a lasting network. 

So am I just an oddball loser? Sometimes the people who want to be friends with me are other lonely sort of losers, but then they just want to vent and talk about their problems. I just want to bounce ideas about stocks, work politics, baseball, etc 

Anyone relate?",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation despite having a seemingly fulfilling life with a family and a stable job. the author expresses a lack of close friendships and a desire for meaningful social connections, which are clear indicators of loneliness. the admission of flaws and the impact of political opinions on relationships further suggest a sense of social alienation. the author mentions attempts to engage in conversations that are often dismissed or overlooked by others, highlighting feelings of being undervalued or ignored. the disparity in the response to the birth of his child between his friends and his wife's friends points to a perceived lack of genuine interest and support from his social circle. the narrative also touches on the challenges of making new friends, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic, and the struggle with finding people to share interests and ideas with. overall, the narrative reveals a longing for deeper connections and the emotional toll of feeling disconnected from others."
"Why does everything come so easily to other people?I'm 19 and everyone around me is surrounded by their best friends having the time of their life. I have friends but no one close and no one to hang with regularly. The only time I really see anyone is when I message them and even when I'm with friends I still feel lonely because they're all very close and I'm just kind of there. A group of friends I have know I feel close to them and know about how badly I'm doing but still don't want to ever message me to do things, only when they need something from me or when I message them first do I get to speak to anyone. Out of everyone I know I'm the only person who doesn't have a close friend group I'm just on my own all the time. It was even worse at the start of the year when I had literally 0 friends and I thought things were getting better before I realised my ""friend group"" actually just turned into a bunch of smaller groups and I was left with no one. It's always been like this and I don't think it'll ever change.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and disconnection from others, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses feelings of being on the periphery of social groups, with no close friends to rely on or regularly spend time with. they describe a one-sided dynamic in their interactions, where they have to initiate contact and feel used when others only reach out when they need something. this lack of reciprocal, meaningful relationships contributes to their sense of loneliness. the comparison to others who seem to have fulfilling social lives exacerbates their feelings of inadequacy and alienation. the narrative also highlights a persistent pattern of loneliness, suggesting that this is a longstanding issue that they feel powerless to change. the emotional tone of hopelessness and resignation further underscores the depth of their loneliness."
"I'm alone in the ER celebrating Christmas without family or friends. God this gets hard sometimes.

"Trouble making friends in your 20sOne of my biggest insecurities is having trouble making and keeping friendships and its starting to get me down. I am a big introvert and suffer anxiety with bouts of depression which started when I moved away to university. I tried to stay in touch with my group of friends from school but many seemed disinterested in talking to me unless I could visit home and go to clubs. This was always something I was never a huge fan of but did to see friends but during uni I suffered financially and couldn't afford this. It especially hurt deeply that my best friend (or who i thought was my best friend) stopped contacting me because of this, even meeting up when i was visiting home.

This made it harder to make friends at uni too but i made a couple friends which was nice and had a long term relationship too which made me feel less lonely. Since moving back home and starting a masters degree, only one friend from uni kept in touch with me and we see eachother once or twice a year. I had tried to get back in touch with an old friend from school and we saw eachother a couple times but she would stand me up frequently to the point where I gave up on the friendship.

I have since found it increasingly hitting my self esteem and making it so much harder to make friends. I made two new friends last year online that I ended up meeting in person as theyre from where I live but I only meet up with them every so often due to work or study commitments, but recently they seem to have been less bothered about talking to me or meeting up, and then I see them on social media hanging out with big groups of people they call their friends and although I am happy they have that, it makes me feel left out and I often wish I was closer to them or had someone other than my SO to call a best friend.

I really value female friendship and not having that connection other than a text here and there makes me feel distant and lonely. I worry that it is me, have I said something? am I not fun enough because im introverted? Previous friendships at school i was often walked all over because I was the quiet one or shy and then I started standing up for myself and distancing from those that did this or made me feel uncomfortable for being introverted. But it seems I cant strike a balance. When I am out with others, i feel I cant fully be myself because of this.

On top of this, I am starting a teaching degree in a few weeks to become a science teacher and while I have come out my shell a lot since being a shy school kid, I always worry I am overlooked or belittled because I am naturally quieter and softly spoken. I always worry what they will think and that hinders my confidence. I just wish it was easier to show that even tho im introverted i still want close friends...",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness characterized by the individual's struggle to maintain and establish meaningful friendships. the writer describes their introverted nature, anxiety, and bouts of depression, which have been exacerbated by their experiences at university and beyond. the difficulty in keeping in touch with old friends and the feeling of being left out when seeing others socialize on social media contribute to their sense of isolation. the narrative also highlights the emotional pain caused by the perceived lack of reciprocation in friendships and the self-doubt that arises from these experiences. the writer's longing for close female friendships and the impact of their introversion on their social interactions are clear indicators of their loneliness. overall, the context and specific examples provided in the narrative underscore the individual's feelings of disconnection and the significant impact on their self-esteem and emotional well-being."
"25, isolated, mental health issues - anyone else lonely in their 20??s?I??m a 25 year old woman - although to be honest I feel like a lost child at times. I??ve recently left an abusive relationship and had to leave my job too, which was gutting, because I finally felt accepted somewhere. 

I now feel embarrassed, am on benefits, am unable to work and suffering PTSD. I already have BPD, and did a lot of work to stabilise myself. I built up a job, had friends, relationships etc but the last one floored me and I??m now either always too scared or too detached to ??get out there?? again. 

I also had to move to a new area which is quite isolated. 

I feel exactly as is always described in those ??lonely old folk?? charity ads - not to downplay it at all, it??s horrible - but I swear you??re not meant to feel like this at 25. I feel more 85. 

What are your experiences with loneliness, mental health and isolation in your 20??s? How did you overcome it?",1,"the narrative describes a 25-year-old woman who feels lost and isolated, akin to the experiences often depicted in advertisements for elderly individuals who are lonely. she has recently left an abusive relationship and had to quit her job, which provided her with a sense of acceptance. the combination of ptsd and bpd has made it difficult for her to re-engage with social and professional life, leading to a sense of embarrassment and dependency on benefits. her relocation to a new, isolated area further exacerbates her feelings of loneliness. the language she uses, such as feeling like a ""lost child"" and comparing herself to ""lonely old folk,"" underscores her profound sense of disconnection and the incongruity of feeling so isolated at a young age. her plea for others' experiences with loneliness and mental health issues in their 20s highlights her desire for connection and understanding, which are critical needs often unmet in those experiencing loneliness."

I am going somewhere where I look different, don't know the language and will be beginning a career teaching esl which is something I have no experience in. To compound the anxiety, I am healing from a knee injury I had a few months ago and still not 100%. I'm scared shitless.

I leave in two weeks and I have no send off, no going away, hell my family aren't even making an effort to see me before I go. 

It's funny cause the announcement I made on facebook about the move got over 200 likes but not a single person has reached out to chat, video, grab lunch, etc. All of this is incredibly depressing and not how I imagined my last few weeks in the states would be. I don't want to begin this experience feeling like less of person.

"i wanna yeet out of a window tbhwell, it's my brithday. but people just come and go. this year, it really shows that they don't care anymore. only a few people greeted me, but they weren't even close to me as friends. who wouldn't get excited and get all giddy waiting for all the wacky greetings from your friends? i did. i waited. they never gave me anything. even just a short ""hbd"" would've been nice coming from them.

i guess in this case if you lose touch to your old collegues, they'll just leave you alone. please don't get me wrong being as an attention seeker especially for a special occassion. i already felt being ignored and not cared about a few months ago. i just reached my breaking point today. ;-;

heck, even my parents never greeted me today too. i shouldn't be expecting more things sooner. i've already gotten used to these types of sitiuations too.

I work in a wearhouse 5 days a week and the past many years have disappeared through routine. Everyone I knew growing up have their friend groups they made in high school or college. I haven't even been asked to do anything or hang out in probably 10 years now. I hate working but it's worse having days off and nobody to spend the day with or anything to do other than sit at home by myself.

Although, this break has just forced me back into my state of loneliness. I have only been out for a few hours just to the shop or to visit family but have spent most of my day in the room with the blinds closed because I don't want neighbours to casually see my in the window just browsing reddit and ""how to overcome anxiety"" articles.

But whenever he gave me some knowledge or advice about life it was amazing and made my life much easier. I still do and follow what he told me.

Does anyone else feel this way too?",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness, as evidenced by the individual's explicit statements of feeling isolated, empty, miserable, and hopeless. the contradictory desire for companionship yet simultaneous aversion to social interaction is a classic symptom of loneliness. this paradoxical behavior often stems from a fear of vulnerability or past negative social experiences, which can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of loneliness. the person's self-questioning and feelings of helplessness further underscore their internal struggle and deep sense of isolation. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, highlighting the emotional and psychological turmoil that accompanies this state."

That was until recently, I've been interacting with other youths (am 24 years old) with similar issues such as myself and I feel like I wanted to interact more and do stuff but my mental health limit me. 

I suffer from severe anxiety and moderate depression so being outgoing is extremely uncomfortable and nearly impossible for me. So I spend my time at home, which I do enjoy. But at the same time, I wish I had people in my life or form any connection with someone. 

I lost my family and I have few friends who live far away so I feel incredibly alone. It wasn't been a problem from an emotional standpoint but recently life has become unbearable and that is often brought on by increasing cases of anxiety attacks and severe depressive episodes. And when you have no one, it's very hard to keep one's head above water.

I don??t have a single friendIt??s my birthday today and it has made me realize how alone I am in life. The only happy birthday I got was from my mom. I had a group of friends who would post instagram stories for each other??s birthdays. They post for everyone but me. I don??t even get a text. I have no friends and I just don??t understand why I??m not likeable,1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and social exclusion, typical indicators of loneliness. the writer highlights their lack of friendships and the absence of social interactions on a significant day, their birthday. the mention of receiving only one birthday wish from their mom underscores the lack of social support and connections. the comparison to their previous friend group, who celebrate each other but exclude the writer, amplifies feelings of rejection and unworthiness. the self-questioning about not being likeable suggests a struggle with self-esteem and self-worth, common psychological impacts of prolonged loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate a profound experience of loneliness and emotional distress."
"Feeling lonely and friendlessMy circle is really small, just my boyfriend and colleagues and family who's kind of far from here. I lost touch with my friends after college. Not that close to my colleagues. Sometimes I join online Meet Ups, but I am still quiet and I feel like I've lost my social skills. I keep worrying about not being a good conversationalist and being judged, so I don't try at all. I have been trying to be better, and starting to see a new therapist soon. But I feel like it's more out of loneliness than anything else. I am 30. Other people my age have achieved so much. And here I am, struggling to make friends.",1,"the narrative reveals several key indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions feeling lonely and friendless, highlighting a small social circle limited to a boyfriend, colleagues, and distant family. the loss of touch with college friends and the lack of closeness with colleagues further emphasize their isolation. their participation in online meetups, coupled with a sense of inadequacy in social skills and fear of judgment, underscores a deep-seated anxiety about social interactions. the ongoing struggle to connect with others and the comparison to peers who seem more socially successful contribute to feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. the decision to see a therapist, motivated by loneliness, reinforces the depth of their emotional distress and desire for social connection."

But I have to wonder, will I ever? How does one do so? Who decides such things? 

As for silver linings, I guess at least my lack of received affection in my life has ensured I haven't become dependent on such things. I suppose loneliness builds character.

Still, I lay here at 1 in the morning on a Monday and wonder what that must be like, being held, and cared for, and knowing that things will be okay. Maybe I'll know someday. But not here, not now. For now, I'll be lonely, and sad, and pathetic, and dull. And I guess I'll just have to live with that.

I try to escape using video games and books, but it??s not the same...",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions feeling worse due to self-quarantining, highlighting a significant change in their emotional state. they reflect on their past year, where they had started going out often, engaging in activities like concerts, restaurants, and movies. despite being alone during these outings, they found solace in being around others, which helped distract from their loneliness and made them feel more human. the shift back to feeling completely alone and disconnected due to the inability to engage in these activities is a clear sign of loneliness. their attempts to escape through video games and books are mentioned, but they acknowledge that these do not provide the same sense of connection or fulfillment. this narrative demonstrates classic signs of loneliness, such as the need for human interaction, even if indirect, and the struggle to find alternative ways to cope with feelings of isolation."

This is prime time to hang out with friends, party, make stupid decisions and regret them later...but here I am, alone in my dorm room scrolling on Reddit. No texts. No calls. No plans. This sucks.

"Feeling like I lost a lot of peopleThe pandemic effected my friend group big time and I feel like I lost so many people so school doesn??t feel the same as it once did. Some dropped out, some are graduating, one of my ??friends?? became toxic after getting into a relationship, and one friend is isolating herself so she doesn??t answer much.

I??m pretty much hyper independent at this point and I don??t really mind it however at times I tend to feel lonely. I miss the times where it was one big friend group hanging out till late at night or going to events together. I hope it gets better and I know it will, it just sucks right now.",1,"the narrative reflects a sense of loss and longing for past social connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. the writer describes significant changes in their friend group due to the pandemic, including friends dropping out, graduating, becoming toxic, or isolating themselves. these changes have led to a shift in their social environment, making school feel different and less enjoyable. the mention of becoming ""hyper independent"" suggests a coping mechanism often adopted when social support diminishes. despite claiming not to mind this independence, the writer admits to feeling lonely at times and reminisces about the past when their friend group was intact and they enjoyed shared activities. the hope for improvement in the future indicates an awareness of their current state of loneliness and a desire for change. overall, the narrative captures the emotional impact of disrupted social connections and the resulting sense of isolation."
"Just lost my last friendEver since highschool my friend group has slowly been shrinking. This year I only had one friend left, and she was my best friend. We would talk and text almost everyday for hours. But today, I found out that she'd been lying to me about liking me as much as she said she did. I told her that it really hurt and that I still wanted to be friends, but she said it would be better if we just stopped talking all together.

"I have never known love or intimacyMy biggest fear is I will go my entire life never experiencing real love and intimacy. I don??t know much about either. I have two friends who are really special to me, like sisters. I try to tell myself that if I can meet two people as great as them, surely I can meet a nice man as well.. but it hasn??t worked out that way. It hurts me a lot. To feel like no one is there for me. In my friends, I tend to be the shoulder. The shoulder to lean on. Even though they reach out and show they care, I always feel misunderstood, or like I??m just living in a society alone, invisible, unheard, and over looked. I??m not aesthetically beautiful. But I don??t think that should matter. I look decent enough, I dress well, I can even pretend not to be socially anxious for a little while. Not sure how to end this lonely rant..thanks for reading lol",1,"the narrative expresses deep feelings of isolation and a yearning for emotional connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author describes a lack of love and intimacy in their life and expresses a fear of never experiencing these fundamental human connections. despite having two close friends, the author still feels misunderstood and invisible, suggesting that these relationships do not fully satisfy their emotional needs. the author also mentions being the supportive friend, which might contribute to their feelings of loneliness as they may not receive the same level of support in return. the emphasis on feeling overlooked and unheard further underscores a sense of social isolation. additionally, the author's concerns about their appearance and social anxiety reflect a lack of self-esteem, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. the narrative concludes with a sense of resignation and a touch of humor, possibly as a coping mechanism, but the underlying pain is evident throughout."
"It??s crazy how forgettable I amNo one cares about me. Not a single person, what??s the point of going on if no one cares? It??s not really fair, I didn??t choose to be like this, I don??t want to be like this anymore. I don??t even know who or what I am. It??s all too much for me to handle. I have no one, to talk to about anything. No one to open up to about how lonely I am. No one to share anything with, even if I did have someone I bet they wouldn??t care. I did have someone, but she doesn??t care anymore. I ruined that because of everything that??s wrong with me. I can??t control my emotions, I overthink everything, I don??t know how to show love or affection, I guess because I was so lonely for so long before her. I??m so pathetic, I can??t stand myself.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and self-deprecation, which are key indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of being forgotten and uncared for, suggesting a lack of meaningful social connections. the repeated emphasis on having no one to talk to or share experiences with highlights a deep sense of social isolation. the mention of a past relationship that ended poorly due to the author's emotional struggles further underscores their feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. the narrative also touches on the inability to manage emotions and the long-standing nature of their loneliness, which are common psychological experiences among those who feel profoundly alone. overall, the despair and self-criticism evident throughout the narrative are typical signs of loneliness, reflecting the author's struggle with a lack of social support and self-worth."
"So lonely but keep making myself believe that I have peopleThis is long and rant like. And it's okay if no one reads or cares. I just want to type on my phone and pretend that somewhere someone will be feeling exactly like me.

Between depression, anxiety , chronic pain and a very toxic relationship, I find myself going days without talking to people. I'm a classic people pleaser with no boundaries and due to trauma, I have lot and lots of people in my life , whose problems I listen to and help them. All of them think I'm very close to them. 

But I have no one. Yes I can shit text one or two of them, but no one to ever check on me. And it's okay, I find myself telling myself. I listen to and help people with no ulterior motive but I find it hard to go on somedays.

I go from app to app, refreshing as if I'll miss a message. When messages do come, saying I'm not fine is not even an option. And plus they wouldn't understand me. Shallow , self absorbed people, is what I like to call some of them. Maybe I'm too harsh. Or maybe I'm too kind. I can't say.

Work has lost meaning few months ago, and sometimes I feel like crying on work calls. I can't frame sentences because somedays I don't know how. I know I'm an empath , but some days I hate everyone, and have no empathy for anyone.

I look at the walls of our shared bedroom , thinking I don't even have my own space. I cry in my bathroom and sit in various places on my bed, as if the feelings and mood will change.  I crave touch , and love. Even an internet stranger who simply cares about me and nothing else.

How did I get so lonely. What did I do wrong. How will I go back to work soon, not being able to cry during the day - striking meaninglessness conversations with people, pretending I care. I remind myself that this is not rock bottom. Rock bottom would be in September when I go back , surrounded by people and yet no one who could see my broken heart and soul. 

Why don't others have that same ability I have to see through 'im fine'. Why doesn't anyone ever truly care with no ulterior motive, if I'm fine. Why doesn't anyone just hear without giving me their toxic positivity.

Will my brain lose the ability to form words? My parents whine about them being lonely. They have each other. They talk. He and I don't even talk. Too empty souls , too scared to leave each other. But can it get worse. I'm so scared of that day. Days pass thinking , how would it be if today was my last day on earth. And I know I would never actively want to die, but where are all those accidents and scary infections. Why doesn't one of them knock me out and end this endless , soul empty-ing loneliness of mine to rest....

I can only wonder.",1,"the narrative is a poignant and vivid description of an individual's profound sense of loneliness and isolation. the person expresses a deep yearning for genuine human connection and understanding, which is starkly absent from their life. the mention of pretending to have people and the desire for someone to feel exactly like them highlights their desperate need for empathy and companionship. their struggle with depression, anxiety, and chronic pain further compounds their feelings of loneliness, as does their involvement in a toxic relationship. the narrative reveals a pattern of one-sided interactions where the individual is a people pleaser, helping others without receiving any support in return. the author describes their days as empty and meaningless, with work losing its significance and an inability to express their true feelings. the craving for touch and love, even from an internet stranger, underscores their deep emotional void. the narrative also touches on the fear of hitting rock bottom and the lack of genuine care from others, which exacerbates their loneliness. overall, the narrative is rich with indicators of loneliness, including the absence of meaningful relationships, feelings of being misunderstood, and a pervasive sense of emptiness and despair."
"I??m alone, sad af, overworked, and wondering what is the point!I??m 30. I consider myself to be somewhat cleaver rather than smart. I??m also realizing what??s the point of this. My back and neck literally hurt all the time. I??ve gone to several Dr. for them to tell me it??s nothing. Everyone is always complaining about something at my job and annoying tf out of me. Part of me really just wants to make a real connection with someone but will I even be able to do so in this state of mind? It just brings me back to, What??s the point? It??s getting hard to handle. I find it funny that ppl will say they think I??m mean, when I??m really just lonely and tired.

"I push people away and then I feel really lonely.I don't know why I do this. I think it's because I don't want them to see how I am, 70% sadness. kinda detaching myself before they leave me. Total crap defense mechanism. Don't do this.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness through the expression of self-isolation and emotional detachment. the author acknowledges pushing people away, which is a common behavior among individuals who fear vulnerability and rejection. this self-imposed isolation exacerbates their loneliness, as they are caught in a cycle of pushing others away to avoid potential hurt, only to feel more alone as a result. the mention of being ""70% sadness"" highlights a pervasive emotional state that contributes to their desire to hide their true self from others. the recognition of this behavior as a ""crap defense mechanism"" indicates an awareness of its counterproductive nature, yet the individual feels trapped in this pattern. these elements collectively underscore the deep-seated loneliness experienced by the author, marked by a struggle with emotional expression and a fear of abandonment."
"Is anyone else completely lonely?Like who doesn't even have anyone to talk to? With zero friends and no partner and they mean it? Since I cut contact with a fake friend that person being the only one I could talk to I'm living a nightmare. It's a never ending cycle for me: I meet someone, we become friends then they slowly show their true colors, they hurt me and we end the friendship. Then I'll go on by being completely lonely for a long time. That's how my life has been since many years. But this time I really can't take it anymore. People would say ""oh, you'll find someone that will stuck with you don't worry"" but I've been waiting for ""that someone"" since my teenage years. It's painful when even in these kind of subreddits you see people who actually have friends. Like, how do people manage to have not one friend, but many? I tried to make friends, at least online. For example, I'm asexual and I joined an asexual forum. It didn't work. I played online games to meet new people and make new friends, it didn't work as well. Hell, on my favorite game I really wanted to befriend a person that I found interesting but the feelings weren't reciprocated. Which hurts even more. I tried here on Reddit, for many years actually, never made any friend from those friendship subs. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been described as smart and kind but I'm still avoided like plague or people are just not interested. I feel like the most inferior person. I feel like I'm not part of these species. I'm crying every night because I just want someone to talk to, I just want a friend. Why can't I have at least that? All I have is non stop suffering. The only thing that kinda helps me is alcohol. But it's going to become useless in the future. I think I just have to accept the fact that I'll be completely alone for the rest of my life and that I will die alone. I'll probably become insane,that's it.",1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and desperation for human connection. the individual describes a cycle of forming friendships that ultimately end in disappointment and pain, leading to a prolonged state of loneliness. the writer's efforts to make friends through various means, including online forums and games, have been unsuccessful, exacerbating their feelings of alienation. they express a deep yearning for companionship and the emotional toll of repeated rejections, culminating in nightly crying and reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism. the pervasive sense of hopelessness and the belief that they will remain alone for the rest of their life are indicative of severe loneliness. the narrative also reflects a struggle with self-worth, as the individual feels inferior and disconnected from others, further reinforcing their isolation."
"I love being alone, I just hate being lonely.Introverted 15M with severe anxiety and depression, both relating to ASD.

I don't get along with people face-to-face. My own family grates on my nerves. It's gotten to the point where I practically live in my room, only venturing out to grab food or use the bathroom.

And, for the most part, I like this lifestyle. Not having someone constantly watching over me feels great. However, as I have learned, there are two main drawbacks to this.

Firstly, my personal hygiene is horrid. I shower once or twice a week (at best), wear the same clothes for days on end, and have yet to open a fresh tube of toothpaste that's been sitting on the counter for months. My messy environment doesn't help, either. I've found dirty sushi trays trapped under my bed on more than one occasion.

Secondly, I don't have any friends.

Well, that's not entirely true. I have one friend who lives down the street from me, yet we haven't seen each other face-to-face in literal months, and my anxiety keeps me away from texting him. So, yeah. One friend, whom I haven't seen since June. It probably doesn't help that I'm homeschooled, either.

I know some of you are thinking, ""Well, why don't you go out and make them?"" And I want to. The thing is, I just can't. I cannot set foot in a public area without having a massive panic attack, provided it's located anywhere near my former school. I'm fine with going out in totally alien areas, so long as no one tries to talk to me, in which case the anxiety gets almost unbearable.

I do have meds to treat it. My psychiatrist prescribed me extremely low doses of hydroxyzine. They are supposed to be taken situationally, and I would, if my mom would let me have access to them. I think she's afraid I'll get addicted or overdose, which is practically impossible at this dosage. We've brought it up to the psychiatrist, and he sides with me, but she still won't listen.

My only interactions with non-family members are with biweekly group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, those go swimmingly. It seems I can't hold a conversation with anyone who isn't mentally ill to some degree...

I don't particularly want to be in a relationship. I've never really felt the urge to be in one. Back when I was in public school, some people would hint about their feelings toward me, and I just wouldn't care. That said, having a girlfriend would probably help to some degree, at least until the inevitable breakup. I'm woefully irresponsible, so I'd probably end up dragging the person down.

I think I'm just gonna cut it off here. This post was supposed to be a ""help me"" affair, but at this point it's become the ramblings of a total lunatic (he he).

TL;DR: At this point, my social life is a lost cause.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and social disconnection. the author mentions severe anxiety and depression, conditions often linked with feelings of loneliness. their description of avoiding social interactions, even with family members, and practically living in their room highlights a significant withdrawal from social life. the lack of personal hygiene and a messy environment further indicate a lack of motivation and self-care, common in individuals experiencing loneliness. the author also notes having only one friend whom they haven't seen in months and the difficulty in making new friends due to anxiety, reinforcing their isolation. homeschooling and limited social interactions, except for biweekly group therapy sessions, contribute to their sense of being cut off from the world. despite the occasional success in group therapy, the narrative overall paints a picture of someone struggling with profound loneliness and a desire for connection hindered by mental health challenges."

I don't have a social life. The only time I leave home is for morning walk and gym which is nearby. I don't meet anyone in my gym as it's empty for my time slot.

If any of you need a friend or anything feel free to DM me and I can talk to you there or what ever your preferred messaging app,1,"the narrative reflects a sense of resignation to being alone forever, which is a typical indicator of loneliness. although the author claims their solitude is by choice to avoid the stress of dating, the underlying tone suggests a deeper acceptance of loneliness as a permanent state. the mention of making a few friends along the way indicates an attempt to find connection and grounding, which is often a coping mechanism for those experiencing loneliness. the offer to be available for others who need a friend further underscores a desire for social interaction and connection, hinting at an unmet need for deeper relationships. these aspects collectively highlight the presence of loneliness despite the author's efforts to frame their solitude as a voluntary and stress-free choice."
"All time lowI'm 23 years old and I've been alone all my life. I have never had a partner, I have never had sex, I have never held someone's hand. I am unwanted.  I can't take it any more. I left work early a few days ago and I've been in my room ever since. The only time I've left is is use to bathroom.. I haven't eaten or drank anything but a few goldfish crackers and the water that was on my Bedside table. I have no drive to do anything at all. I take sleeping pills the second I wake up so that I can just sleep. I can't stop thinking about how much i fucking hate everything about myself. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now. I just hate everything about my life. I don't think I will ever be able to find someone who I can be with, and if I can't experience life with someone I love, then I don't want to experience it at all. I feel like I'm at the end. I don't even want try and meet anyone anymore. I just want to lay in my bed and sleep until I don't wake up. I thought about checking myself into a hospital, but after reading about how badly suicidal patients are often treated in the U.S, I will no longer be doing that. I don't think there is any help for me anyway. I'm on medication, I've been to therapy, nothing helps. I don't know how much longer I can continue.",1,"the narrative is deeply reflective of an individual's profound sense of loneliness and despair. the person describes a life marked by persistent isolation, having never experienced intimate connections such as a romantic relationship, physical affection, or companionship. these admissions are potent indicators of loneliness, as they highlight a lack of meaningful social bonds. the narrative also conveys a severe sense of hopelessness and self-loathing, with the individual expressing feelings of being unwanted and a pervasive hatred towards themselves. the behaviors described, such as self-imposed isolation, neglect of basic needs like eating and drinking, and the use of sleeping pills to avoid wakefulness, further illustrate the depth of their despair. the mention of considering but ultimately rejecting hospitalization due to fear of mistreatment underscores a sense of helplessness and distrust in available support systems. overall, the narrative paints a vivid picture of an individual engulfed in loneliness, struggling with severe depression, and feeling disconnected from any form of support or relief."
"I complain about my situation and being lonely with no friends but I??ve realized I??ve been like this my entire lifeI??ve always been very introverted. I??ve always avoided the company of others at family gatherings. I wasn??t socializing well with the other kids at elementary school. I??ve never had a school friend come over to my place before. I??ve always spent my days playing video games and scrolling away on my phone. But why only now am I feeling desolate and lonely? Idk, I think I??m on my own path to living life as a recluse, or at least just alone most of the time.  The thing is, I don??t want to do anything with my life either. I keep telling myself there??s nothing to do because I have nobody to do anything with but it??s the complete other way around. I have nobody to do anything with because I literally do nothing and spend my days at home. I??m kind of content with it honestly. I wonder wtf I??m gonna do with my life, probably nothing honestly lmao. I know I??m only 20 and I??m not supposed to have figured shit out yet but eh. I genuinely wonder what I??m going to end up doing with my life.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and self-reflection on the part of the individual. the author expresses awareness of their lifelong introversion and avoidance of social interactions, citing specific instances such as not socializing well in elementary school and never having friends over. despite a semblance of contentment with their solitary lifestyle, there is an underlying tone of desolation and confusion about their future. the mention of feeling desolate and lonely now, despite having always been introverted, highlights a shift in their emotional state. the individual's acknowledgment of doing nothing and having no motivation to change their situation further underscores their loneliness. the repeated questioning of their future and the passive acceptance of a potentially unfulfilling life are typical indicators of someone experiencing loneliness. the narrative's introspective nature and the expressed emotional turmoil provide clear signs of the individual's struggle with loneliness."
"My experience with Loneliness, and severe Social Anxiety.This is going to be kinda long, so sorry in advance if it looks like a wall of text. This will probably get buried, but I greatly appreciate anyone that sees, and reads this. 

So, here it goes:

I'm about to be 17 years old, and fortunate to have 1 friend, and a GF (long distance), but generally I don't talk to anyone. For the last 3 years of my life I've been endlessly falling into an abyss. Seemingly, my misery won't end until the day I die.

It hurts seeing the connections others have, and the endless amount of stories they have with the people the hold dearest. I want a story of my own to tell, but I'm too timid, and shy in nature to do much of anything.

The truth is, I've had really bad social anxiety my entire life. I'm not on the spectrum or anything. I'm just too reserved. One might think it's because I want it to be that way, but in all honesty, that isn't the case. I desperately want to make connections. I want to have friends, and I want to be able to socialize with others. I really do love talking to people, and it's the only thing that brings me happiness anymore.

Talking has always been an issue for me. My social anxiety makes me so quiet to the point where people might actually assume that I'm mute. Whenever people do try to talk to me, I usually seem uninterested, or unfriendly - usually because of how nervous I get. I feel so pathetic that I'm afraid that my girlfriend will leave me because of how shy, and quiet I am. I feel like my heart crackles whenever I consider the possibility.

I spend every day staying in my room doing nothing, but dreading life. I've contemplated ending my life to escape my pain. I feel like I'm at the end of the road, where this is as good as life is ever going to be. That I'm just going to be sad, and lonely forever.

So, that's my take on life. Not much else to say.

TL;DR: Living life in a lonely bubble, unable to escape. Severe social anxiety has crushed everything left in me.",1,"the narrative vividly describes an intense struggle with social anxiety and a profound sense of loneliness. the individual mentions having only one friend and a long-distance girlfriend, yet they still feel overwhelmingly isolated. their longing for deeper connections and their pain from observing others' relationships are clear indicators of loneliness. the mention of social anxiety exacerbates their feelings of isolation, as it hinders their ability to communicate and form bonds. the recurring themes of despair, self-doubt, and the contemplation of ending their life further underscore the depth of their loneliness. their daily routine of staying in their room and dreading life highlights a lack of social interaction and fulfillment. overall, the narrative reflects classic signs of loneliness, including a strong desire for social connection, feelings of inadequacy, and the pervasive impact of social anxiety on their mental health."
"Spent the 5th alone.The 5th of November is guy fawkes night in the UK, and is one of three days in the year that I really like to get out, hang out and be social and jovial with people. My one and only 'friend' - and I use that term loosely is one of these people that only keeps people around him if/when they're useful. The last two years or so has taken to drinking almost every night. A week ago we had plans to go karting, then go and catch an organised fireworks display in a city about an hours drive away from here. I say 'plan' as much as it is possible to have plans with him, because again... Everything revolves around him and his schedule. Suffice to say, he went out last night and got wasted, totally eliminating the possibility of us doing anything today. So I slept. Pretty much the whole day, alone. I did manage to get out and go to the movies by myself...but still, by myself. I could have gone to an organised fireworks display or something by myself, but what's the point if you can't laugh joke and mess about with the people you're with? You'd just be a Billy no mates who stands around, doesn't interact and just goes home. Pointless. This one 'friend' is literally the only one I do outdoorsy things with and he can't even lay off the fucking alcohol for one night so he can stick to a plan he made a week ago. I can't make plans. The plans have to be his, and even then they're just flexible plans. 'at somepoint' 'probably' 'if we have time' 'if I don't have other plans'.

I have other friends sure, but honestly they have other issues that I don't have any patience for because they're problems of their own choosing, or character flaws that they either won't acknowledge, or won't correct. I have flaws, that much I'll admit but I won't make my problems other people's problems. I'll just keep them to myself and just live in the moment if I'm with friends, and i don't get why other people just can't swallow their bullshit for a while, and not tell me about it.

It honestly occurs to me that I am the problem, I play this hard done by person but maybe I attract this kind of thing because of the type of person I am? I honestly don't know what to do, other than do what I've been doing for way too long and just shut myself in, ignore other people's requests to hang out (especially this one 'friend' brcause it's always his idea to go out, and never mine) and just try and figure out my own thing to do. Which in all likelyhood is just going to be the same as always, more YouTube videos, TV and movies than the average person, sleep, rinse, repeat.

I think I'm done with people. Or maybe they are done with me. Either way, it's lonely as fuck, and i fucking hate it.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and frustration with social interactions. the individual describes a strong desire to engage in social activities, particularly on significant days like guy fawkes night, yet finds themselves repeatedly let down by their only friend. this friend’s unreliability and self-centered behavior exacerbate the narrator's feelings of loneliness. the narrative also highlights the individual's sense of disconnection from other friends, who they perceive as having their own unmanageable issues. there is a clear indication of self-reflection and self-blame, with the narrator questioning if they are the problem and contemplating their role in attracting unreliable friends. the repeated theme of spending time alone, engaging in solitary activities like watching movies or youtube videos, and the expressed hatred for their lonely state are all strong indicators of loneliness. the overall tone of resignation and the cyclical nature of their solitary routine further emphasize their deep-seated loneliness and dissatisfaction with their social life."
"At this point, i already know I'm always going to be alone.I've never had friends really, I've never been close to anyone, I've never hugged anyone (at least from any of my memories), and I've never dated...which i probably never will.

I thought maybe things would get better after i got older, got a job...but nothing has changed, it's just gotten worse...

I just feel terrible all the time, trying to ignore how much I hate being alive, and how lonely i am, and how i know that nobody will ever love or even like me in any sort of way...",1,"the narrative reflects deep feelings of loneliness and isolation. the author mentions never having had friends or close relationships, which are key indicators of social isolation. the lack of physical affection, such as never having hugged anyone, underscores a significant absence of intimate connections. the expectation that things might improve with age or employment, followed by the realization that nothing has changed and has possibly worsened, highlights a persistent and chronic sense of loneliness. the expression of feeling terrible all the time and the struggle to ignore the pain of being alive further points to emotional distress commonly associated with loneliness. the conviction that nobody will ever love or like them in any way suggests a profound sense of hopelessness and low self-worth, which are often linked to severe loneliness. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing significant and ongoing loneliness."
"I??m starting to have a feeling where all of my friends don??t like me anymoreSchool is starting in 2 more days for me, so 3 weeks earlier I asked all of my friends if they wanna hang out with me before school starts, unfortunately they all said no, some just ignored me and some say they were not interested. I recently saw their post/stories about them having fun, weather they were at the mall, or zoo or even just messing around at a 711. While I was just sitting on a couch doing nothing at all. So technically, I wasted a whole summer doing nothing, I could??ve done plans with myself but being alone isn??t that fun. Since school is starting in 2 more days for me, I am not excited to go through the same bullshit again, at school no one likes me, with no one liking me it cause me to be extremely lonely at school, a lot of times it made me sad to the point my grades start dropping. My dad keeps yelling at me to get good grades, but my loneliness isn??t allowing me to do so. I have been dealing with this problem since grade 1, the school thought I have some learning disability because of it.",1,"the narrative reflects feelings of isolation and rejection, with the individual expressing that their friends no longer seem interested in spending time with them. specific examples include friends ignoring their invitations to hang out and seeing those same friends having fun without them. this sense of exclusion is compounded by the individual’s anticipation of returning to school, where they feel unloved and unsupported, leading to sadness and academic struggles. the individual's loneliness is evident through their lack of social interaction, feelings of being unwanted, and the negative impact on their emotional well-being and school performance. these are clear indicators of loneliness, as the individual experiences a profound sense of disconnection and lack of companionship."
"Hopefully this fits this subI don??t know that I fit the dictionary definition lonely, I have a group of friends that care about me, but throughout my first two and a half years of high school I would find myself at home alone after school while other people would be making plans and hanging out. The root of this problem feels like it stemmed from the fact that my closest friend is somewhat introverted and spends a lot of time with his family. This combined with him having a packed schedule and a girlfriend largely limited the of social interaction I experienced. This year I??ve been making an effort to hang out with other people to stop feeling alone, but now with lockdown and whatnot, all bets are off. I??ve been feeling very lonely, but even though my friends have been online on discord I??ve been feeling very low on energy and feel like I don??t have the energy to interact with others. All of this combined with the fact that I??m still getting over a recent breakup has been making me feel like there??s nobody around who cares that I exist even though the rational part of my brain understands that I have people that do.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness despite having a social circle. the author mentions feeling alone at home while others are socializing, indicating a lack of meaningful social interaction. the introversion and busy schedule of their closest friend, along with the friend's relationship, have further limited their social experiences. the effort to connect with others has been thwarted by lockdown restrictions, exacerbating feelings of isolation. the recent breakup adds to the emotional burden, leading to a sense of abandonment and low energy, despite rationally knowing that friends care. these elements collectively highlight classic indicators of loneliness: isolation, unfulfilled social needs, and emotional distress."
"Get yourself a cat or dog or even a hamster :3 they fill any gaping voidIf you're severely introverted like me, literally any pet will keep you company if you are really lonely. They might not talk, but if you do it right, they will nuzzle and be next to you whenever you're in their presence",1,"the narrative suggests that the author is experiencing loneliness, as indicated by their recommendation to get a pet to fill a ""gaping void."" this choice of words implies a significant emotional emptiness or lack of companionship. the author describes themselves as ""severely introverted,"" which can often lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness due to reduced social interactions. the suggestion that ""literally any pet will keep you company if you are really lonely"" further emphasizes their own experience with loneliness and the comfort they find in having a pet. the use of phrases like ""nuzzle and be next to you"" highlights the need for physical presence and emotional support, common indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a clear awareness and personal experience of loneliness, as well as the strategies the author employs to cope with it."
"Any lonely people out there looking to chat about it?I was actually feeling pretty good for a while, but suddenly I??m feeling overwhelming loneliness every night. It??s not even sadness either, just a somber, overwhelming feeling of emptiness. I??ve never considered myself a sad person but I??m certainly not a happy one, and being kind of a loner, this is probably my best chance to chat. 

19M, message me (or don??t) If you??re interested, we can chat.",1,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of loneliness through various indicators. the individual explicitly mentions feeling ""overwhelming loneliness every night,"" which is a direct expression of their emotional state. the description of the feeling as ""somber"" and ""overwhelming"" highlights the intensity and persistence of their loneliness. the person also notes an emptiness that isn't necessarily tied to sadness, suggesting a deeper, more pervasive sense of isolation. their self-identification as ""kind of a loner"" further reinforces their social disconnection. the plea for others to chat about loneliness indicates a desire for social interaction and connection, which is a common coping mechanism for those experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative's explicit expressions of loneliness, feelings of emptiness, and desire for connection are typical indicators of someone experiencing loneliness."
"i am numbing from loneliness and can't feel true emotionsi have friends and a best friend. he (my best friend) was the same, until he got in a relationship with his longtime crush/friend. don't get me wrong. i'm not mad that he's happy. heck, i'm happy that finally has someone that understands him.

i am numbing. i don't know why. i don't understand sympathy and empathy.",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of emotional numbness and disconnection, which are common indicators of loneliness. the writer expresses an inability to feel true emotions, even in situations that typically elicit strong emotional responses, such as the death of close family members. the mention of having friends and a best friend who recently entered a relationship highlights a contrast between the writer's emotional state and that of their friend, exacerbating feelings of isolation. the happiness they describe feels hollow, suggesting that social connections are not fulfilling their emotional needs. the writer's struggle to understand sympathy and empathy further underscores a profound sense of disconnection from others, which is a key aspect of loneliness. these elements collectively illustrate the writer's experience of loneliness and emotional numbness."

But i neber habe a friend i hang out with a lot. And also i almost always habe to take the Initiative for meeting them. When we are together we have fun and have good talks but after that its just silence till we meet again. No Whatsapp nothing. I dont know why it is this way and its making me frustrated. Also meeting new people is extremely hard for me cause im really nervous when im around people i dont know and probably come of as an awkward selfconscious guy. I hope for it getting better and i take little steps but it feels like i can not reach the goal. I just wanted to spill the beans cause i dont want to keep it inside :/",1,"the narrative reveals several indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of frustration and isolation due to the lack of frequent social interactions and the need to always initiate contact with friends. they describe themselves as a ""loner"" and mention that despite having fun and good conversations when they do meet friends, there is a prolonged silence and lack of communication in between these meetings. the absence of ongoing connections, such as through whatsapp, exacerbates their sense of disconnection. additionally, the author struggles with meeting new people due to nervousness and self-consciousness, which likely hinders their ability to form new friendships. their hope for improvement and taking small steps towards social integration highlights a desire for change, but also underscores the difficulty they face in achieving it. the overall tone and content of the narrative reflect a deep sense of loneliness and the emotional toll it takes on the individual."
"I would really like some new friendsI feel lonely all the time. My real friends left me few years ago and I cannot seem to appeal to any girls even though I have my life on rails, am rather attractive... It just blows being all by myself all day and night.",1,"the narrative indicates a strong sense of loneliness, as the individual explicitly states feeling lonely all the time and expresses a desire for new friends. the mention of real friends leaving a few years ago suggests a significant loss of social connections, which is a common precursor to loneliness. the difficulty in forming new relationships, despite perceiving oneself as attractive and having one's life on track, highlights a disconnect between self-perception and social reality. the expression of being alone all day and night further emphasizes the pervasive nature of their loneliness. these elements collectively point to a deep sense of social isolation and unmet social needs, which are typical indicators of loneliness."
"Feels like the loneliness is unbearableI feel like I'm slowly losing my mind and consciousness. It sucks too bad when you fall for someone you didn't know that all the love, all the affection will go down the drain because from the beginning, you had no chance and no stand in their heart. 

Sometimes it feels like a hole in my chest, sometimes it feels like someone is wielding a sharp knife, uncontrollably stabbing my heart. 

I don't know how to describe it, I am not sure if I can still feel my heart beating. What is the cause of all of this misery and pain? Why does it happen every single time I feel something nice is happening to me? What is actually wrong with me? 

I don't know..",1,"the narrative vividly expresses deep emotional pain and a sense of despair that are clear indicators of loneliness. the individual describes feelings of unbearable loneliness and a sense of losing their mind, which are common symptoms of severe emotional distress. the metaphor of a hole in the chest and the imagery of being stabbed in the heart highlight the intense emotional suffering. the narrative also reflects a pattern of unreciprocated love and affection, leading to a recurring sense of rejection and worthlessness. the questioning of self-worth and the inability to understand the cause of their misery further underline a profound sense of isolation and hopelessness. these aspects collectively suggest that the individual is experiencing significant loneliness and emotional turmoil."
"Nights are the hardestWhen I'm all alone and need to distract myself and make the time go by. When I'm not in as much pain, it's a bit easier. Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic about the future... but when things are fresh, they fucking suck. Some things still stick with me to this day. I spend the moments that I have alone refreshing new on subreddits and reading posts, listening to music, and playing games. This combination of things helps keep my brain busy the most. I keep the hope alive in my heart that one day things will change and I'll meet more people who don't make me feel alone and make me look forward to each day. Someone nice to spend the nights with. I know there are people out there that feel the exact same way as me, somewhere. We need each other right now but we just haven't met. Maybe we never will. Life is cruel like that... but it's okay. I'm doing my best, and maybe things will start to look up for me. It's all I can hope for, because without holding onto that hope and optimism, my life will only be sad. I want more, I want to be happy. Hopefully I don't have to wait much longer, because damn I'm having a hard time. 23 is my lucky number, and since I'm 23 now, I've been telling myself maybe this year good things will happen. Not yet, just the same shit. BUT the year isn't over, so I can hold onto my lame superstition for a little while longer.",1,"the narrative is filled with expressions of isolation and a longing for connection, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author describes nights as particularly challenging, emphasizing the struggle of being alone and needing distractions to pass the time. this highlights the difficulty of solitary moments and the emotional pain associated with them. the mention of feeling more optimistic when not in pain suggests a fluctuating state of mind heavily influenced by their sense of isolation. the activities listed—refreshing subreddits, reading posts, listening to music, and playing games—are solitary in nature and serve as coping mechanisms to keep the mind occupied, further indicating a lack of social interaction. the hope for change and the desire to meet people who alleviate feelings of loneliness reveal a deep yearning for companionship. the acknowledgment that others might feel the same way and the wish to find them underscore the author's awareness of their own loneliness. the narrative's tone, marked by a mix of hope and resignation, captures the essence of someone grappling with loneliness, holding onto optimism as a means to endure their current state. the reference to a lucky number and the hope that this year might bring change reflects a reliance on small, perhaps irrational, sources of hope to combat feelings of despair. overall, the narrative paints a vivid picture of an individual deeply affected by loneliness, seeking solace in distractions and the faint hope of future connections."
"Bored out of my mindI keep thinking about how I haven??t had a single, thoughtful, meaningful, intellectually stimulating conversation with anyone in a really long time. I am married with three young children. English is not my husband??s first language and he does not like reading or learning new things. His family speaks another language and I??ve never had real, in depth conversations with them. My other family and close friends are across the country.

I want to be around people who stimulate my mind, not keep me standing still. ",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and a lack of meaningful intellectual engagement, which are classic indicators of loneliness. the author expresses a deep longing for thoughtful and stimulating conversations, something they feel is missing from their current interactions. despite being married and having children, they highlight a significant communication barrier with their husband due to language differences and his disinterest in learning. this lack of connection extends to his family, with whom they also struggle to engage meaningfully. the author’s close family and friends are geographically distant, further exacerbating their sense of isolation. their passion for learning and desire for intellectually stimulating interactions are unmet, leaving them feeling stagnant and disconnected. the repeated mention of being ""bored out of my mind"" and ""super lonely"" underscores the emotional impact of their unmet social and intellectual needs. these elements collectively paint a clear picture of loneliness, driven by a lack of deep, meaningful connections and intellectual companionship."
"Envious, Lonely, and StrugglingI hate feeling isolated and alone- even worse because i feel trapped there due to the pandemic.

I don't want that. I just need someone to talk to. I just want real friends.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and abandonment following the departure from an abusive marriage. the individual describes a lack of support from friends, which exacerbates feelings of loneliness and emotional pain. the expectation of support and the subsequent disappointment when it is not received highlight a deep yearning for connection and validation. the description of daily pain, the desire for communication to prevent deeper depression, and the struggle with significant life changes such as the divorce process, unemployment, and homelessness are indicative of severe loneliness. the mention of feeling empty and the inclination to withdraw further into isolation underscores the psychological impact of their situation. the plea for someone to talk to and the longing for genuine friendships are clear indicators of the individual's loneliness and need for social support."
"Been feeling better lately so I haven??t posted here in a while but now I??m back.I??m back because, well, I??m lonely. For a while I blamed myself but come to think of it I have nothing to blame myself for. I consider myself a genuine person that is kind to others, and probably cares too much for others as well. When people want nothing to do with me it??s easy to blame myself, which is what I have done, but realistically it??s other people that are to blame. I have no friends because I choose to not have friends. Not because I??m incapable of friendship, but because the people I usually allow to get close to me aren??t bettering my life in anyway. They are actually making my life worse. I tend to hold onto friendships, or relationships for that matter, longer than I should. Only for it to end by their choosing when I should??ve been me to end it. I knew all along it wasn??t worth my time, yet I gave it my everything. And when they finally decide to cut me off, it feels like a diss to me. Like I??m the one that caused it. Everyday I try to progressively become better at not caring about other people as much, but there is still that void that needs to be filled. Will I ever find the right one to fill that gap? Who??s to say. I will keep trying though. I do know that next time I won??t be wearing the shoes in the relationship. A precautionary for myself, so I won??t let myself be hurt by someone again.",1,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loneliness, evident through the author's introspective examination of their relationships and feelings of isolation. they mention feeling better for a while but returning to a state of loneliness, which suggests a recurring struggle with these emotions. the author's self-blame and subsequent realization that others might be at fault indicate a pattern of internalizing negative experiences, a common trait among lonely individuals. the decision to avoid friendships because they do not enhance their life, and the tendency to hold onto relationships longer than necessary, further underscores their sense of disconnection and self-protection. the narrative also highlights the void they feel and their uncertainty about finding someone to fill it, a poignant indicator of their loneliness. the resolution to not let themselves be hurt again shows a desire for self-preservation but also hints at a fear of vulnerability, which can perpetuate feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative is rich with indicators of loneliness, including self-reflection, feelings of blame, isolation, and a protective stance against future hurt."
whyi have a couple of friends and a boyfriend yet i still feel so alone. i want to cry every night.,1,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of emotional isolation despite the presence of social connections like friends and a boyfriend. this paradox is a common indicator of loneliness, where an individual feels disconnected or misunderstood even in the company of others. the desire to cry every night highlights a deep, persistent sadness and emotional pain, which are typical symptoms of loneliness. the phrase ""i still feel so alone"" suggests that the individual's relationships are not fulfilling their emotional needs, leading to a feeling of emptiness. this mismatch between social presence and emotional satisfaction is a critical aspect of loneliness, as it underscores the difference between being alone and feeling alone. the narrative reflects a struggle to find meaningful connections and emotional support, which are essential for psychological well-being."

Although they were good ways to distract loneliness, they did not make it go away.

I wish I had people in my life who checked up on me.I always hear about people who are going through difficult times who have friends who randomly call or text them to see if they??re okay. I just wished people cared enough about me to see how I was doing.,1,"the narrative expresses a clear desire for social connection and the absence of it, which are strong indicators of loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions wishing for people who check up on them, highlighting a sense of isolation and unmet social needs. the comparison to others who have supportive friends further emphasizes their feeling of being left out and uncared for. the longing for care and attention suggests a deep emotional need for companionship and validation, which are common psychological markers of loneliness. this desire for social interaction and the feeling of being overlooked are key elements that align with the experience of loneliness."
"So lonelyI feel so alone. More alone then I??ve ever felt in my life. The thing is I probably ??shouldn??t??. I have a husband. I have a daughter. I??m close to my parents. But here I am..still feeling so incredibly alone. No one sees me. 

A year ago yesterday I gave birth to twin sons, they both died only hours after being born. Not one of my friends or family members (other than my husband and mom) reached out. And then this morning my mom showed me all the messages her friends sent her yesterday. Meanwhile I??m forgotten completely. It would be nice to have those kind words sent my way sometimes. 

I??m grateful for what I do have. But my heart hurts. It??s so lonely being a grieving mother. People don??t want to reach out or talk to me about it (or anything for that matter). It makes them uncomfortable. So I??m left alone. And maybe I should reach out to someone but I don??t want to be that burden. I don??t want to bring people down. So instead I post on Reddit I guess. At least it feels good to vent to random internet strangers.",1,"the narrative reflects profound feelings of loneliness despite the presence of close family members, which is a common experience for individuals dealing with complex grief and loss. the author describes feeling unseen and forgotten by their social circle, particularly highlighting the lack of support from friends and extended family during a time of immense personal tragedy. the mention of the twin sons' death and the subsequent isolation underscores the depth of their emotional pain and the disconnect from those around them. the author's acknowledgment of their gratitude for their current relationships juxtaposed with the persistent loneliness and heartache emphasizes the internal conflict and isolation they feel. the narrative also touches on the stigma and discomfort others may feel in addressing grief, further isolating the individual. the decision to seek solace in anonymous online platforms suggests a desperation for connection and understanding that is not being met in their immediate environment. these elements collectively illustrate the hallmarks of loneliness: the sense of being emotionally and socially disconnected despite the physical presence of others."
"Im feeling really lonely and want to make friendsIm 14,male,and im interested in video games,art and anime.",1,"the narrative expresses a clear sense of loneliness, highlighted by the individual's direct statement of feeling lonely and the desire to make friends. the writer's age and gender, while not necessarily indicative of loneliness on their own, provide context that can be relevant as adolescents often face social challenges. the mention of interests such as video games, art, and anime suggests hobbies that can be both solitary and communal, indicating a potential struggle to find like-minded peers to share these activities with. the straightforward and somewhat urgent tone in expressing their loneliness and the wish for companionship are strong indicators of their current emotional state. these elements collectively point to the individual's experience of loneliness, as they explicitly articulate their feelings and their need for social connection."
"Idk what more to doI've told the people in my life that I'm very lonely. (My fiance being the one I've told the most), and it's like he did one or two things over a week span to make me feel less alone, then goes right back to just ignoring my feelings. Or at least it seems like it. I don't have any friends because honestly, all of my friends have been shitty people in the end, so I cut them off. My mom loves with my fiance and I. She knows how I feel, but she can only do so much because she was diagnosed with an illness a couple of months ago.

I'm just so fucking lonely.",1,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of isolation and emotional neglect. the individual explicitly states their feelings of loneliness and their attempts to communicate this to their fiance, who seems to provide only temporary and insufficient support. the mention of having no friends due to past negative experiences further emphasizes the lack of a social support network. the presence of the individual's mother, who is also limited in her ability to provide comfort due to her illness, adds to the sense of helplessness and isolation. these elements collectively point to a significant experience of loneliness, marked by a lack of meaningful connections and support systems."
"I'm just the type of person destined to be lonelySpend all Sunday alone studying at school, and I come home to one of my housemates having friends over and they won't stop laughing loudly. I really shouldn't hold it against them, she's been depressed for a while before and these are her new friends. Anyways this isn't the point 

I can try to be as outgoing as I can be, but it won't change my natural disposition to be reserved. To not keep in contact with someone after I've met them since I assume people won't like me or find me interesting. To not plan things myself and wait to be invited instead. To be slightly awkward and avoid close conversation topics because I don't want people to get to know me and say ""That's it?"" 

If I want to make friends I have to be ""on"" at 100% and if I start to slip up I will be seen as reserved/disinterested/assholeish 

God why do I have to be a human. I don't need this evolved hunger for human connection. Not in this world.

If I was a robot I would never feel lonely. Never feel horny. Or at least my dick would work. Never procrastinate. Never feel self conscious. I would sleep with no problem. 

Or I could die and a robot could replace me. 

This life thing. This happiness thing has better be worth it. 

They're still laughing. God damn I wish I lived somewhere else 

But then again things are the same no matter where I go. It's probably me, my vibe that creates these situations. I'm fucked. Rant over",1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and self-perceived inadequacy. the individual describes spending time alone and feeling disconnected from social interactions, even when others around them are engaging in joyful activities. they express a belief that their reserved nature and difficulty in maintaining contact with others are inherent traits, leading to a sense of inevitability about their loneliness. the mention of needing to be ""on"" at 100% to make friends, and the fear of being judged or found uninteresting, highlights a profound insecurity and fear of rejection. the longing to be a robot to escape human emotions, including loneliness, underscores the intensity of their desire to avoid the pain associated with social disconnection. these elements are typical indicators of loneliness, as they reflect feelings of social inadequacy, fear of rejection, and a pervasive sense of isolation."
Why do I never get invitedMy friends do sleepovers and partys all the time and in school we always talk and are a close group but yet outside of school I never get invited. I just want to know why? What do I do wrong? Why do they not invite me?,1,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of exclusion and confusion about social dynamics, which are common indicators of loneliness. the author expresses feelings of being left out despite having close interactions with friends in school, highlighting a disparity between perceived friendship and actual social engagement. the repeated questioning of their own actions and the search for reasons behind their exclusion suggests a lack of self-worth and social validation. the author’s emphasis on not being invited to social gatherings like sleepovers and parties underscores their yearning for inclusion and acceptance. these elements collectively point to an experience of loneliness, as the individual grapples with feelings of isolation and a desire for meaningful connections outside of the structured school environment."
"Were all lonely people, right?Saw a post on here that inspired me. I'm m22, and I'm ready to talk and get to know someone, specifically a girl. I like playing videogames, watching movies, and cuddling on the couch. I like to think I'm a good listener, but always trying to improve. :) I love music. Both listening to it and playing it. I LOVE jazz, just beggining to learn from the real book on my piano, so if youre a jazz fiend. You probably know WAYY more than me, lol. I love obsessing over stupid fandom bs.

I would also just love the practice in talking to/flirting with women. If things go well, I might even give you my ig",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is open, enthusiastic, and actively seeking social connections. the person expresses a variety of interests such as playing video games, watching movies, and listening to music, which are common hobbies that can facilitate social interactions. the writer mentions being a good listener and expresses a desire to improve, indicating a willingness to engage meaningfully with others. their interest in learning jazz and discussing their passions further demonstrates a proactive approach to building connections. the lighthearted tone and use of humor, such as the playful apology for potentially talking too much about frank ocean, suggest a positive and engaging personality. overall, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of social interaction, but rather shows an individual who is eager to connect and share experiences with others."
I've made it back to feeling numb[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a state of emotional numbness rather than loneliness. feeling numb can often be associated with a variety of emotional and psychological conditions, including depression, trauma, or burnout. the lack of specific mentions of social isolation, yearning for connection, or feelings of being left out suggests that the primary issue here is not loneliness. instead, the numbness indicates a detachment from emotions, which can be a defense mechanism or a symptom of another underlying condition. without explicit expressions of missing social interactions or the pain of solitude, the narrative does not align with typical indicators of loneliness."

I wish I was able to talk to every soul on here that??s going through a tough time or feeling down! If you come across this please feel free to reach out! Hope everyone has a great day!,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of gratitude and community engagement, which are indicators of social connectedness rather than loneliness. the author acknowledges and appreciates the support received from others, suggesting they feel part of a supportive network. the desire to reach out and help others going through tough times also indicates empathy and social interest, which are typically less common in individuals experiencing loneliness. the overall tone is positive and inclusive, with the author encouraging others to connect, further reinforcing the sense of belonging and mutual support. these elements collectively suggest that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
I appreciate ??I??m here if you need me.?? But I don??t think I??d be feeling this way they were here in the first place.nan,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of gratitude for the offer of support, indicated by the phrase ""i appreciate 'i'm here if you need me.'"" this expression shows that the individual recognizes and values the presence of others who are willing to help. however, the second part of the statement, ""but i don’t think i’d be feeling this way they were here in the first place,"" implies that the person believes their current feelings might be alleviated if the supportive individuals were physically present more often. this sentiment does not necessarily indicate loneliness but rather a preference for more direct or frequent interactions. it suggests that the individual has a support network and is aware of it, which typically points away from feelings of isolation or loneliness. the narrative's overall tone and content highlight a desire for more consistent presence rather than a lack of connection, which aligns with the classification."
"Its not that I want friends, I'm just incredibly bored and totally aimlessmoney is a funny thing, you say you dont care about it and yet you keep saving it and you get scared if it goes below a certain percentage.

I dont want to be homeless and starve that much I know. How terrible for life to be reduced to a stick and no carrot",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of existential boredom and disillusionment rather than loneliness. the author expresses a lack of desire for friendships and relationships, suggesting a sense of self-sufficiency in their social life. their concerns are more focused on the futility of societal norms and the pursuit of material wealth, indicating a philosophical discontent rather than a yearning for social connection. they acknowledge feeling aimless and question the purpose of their actions, yet they do not express a longing for companionship or emotional support. instead, they seem to be grappling with broader existential questions about the meaning of life and the value of societal expectations. the absence of expressions of isolation or a desire for meaningful human interaction supports the classification, as the individual's struggles appear rooted in existential and philosophical dissatisfaction rather than loneliness."
"Not allowed to loveHas anyone felt like they're just not allowed to find love? Like the universe just doesn't put them in the right place at the right time? I don't want to ask a girl that I work with / at my job out. I don't want to have a workplace relationship. However I find this girl very attractive and would love to be with her. I only talk to her as an associate to keep our relationship professional for the better of both of us (unfortunate for me). Just found out that she's with someone. Someone who was lucky enough to be where the universe doesn't want me to be. The right time and the right place. I don't wish I was him. I just wish I was where he was when he talked to her instead of being where I unfortunately have to be. Maybe me and her could've developed something. That would've been nice.  Just another reason why i hate this job. I want out but the universe won't let me do that either.

A romantic relationship not a platonic one. There is a difference and I respect both. I like her romantically and not plantonically. Nothing wrong with that. Normal human behavior.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and resignation towards the individual's romantic life, particularly in the context of workplace relationships. the person expresses a desire for a romantic connection but feels constrained by professional boundaries and circumstances beyond their control. despite the evident longing for a relationship with a specific colleague, the narrative does not convey the deeper emotional isolation or pervasive sense of disconnection typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on situational obstacles and the perceived misalignment of opportunities rather than an overarching feeling of being alone or unsupported. the individual acknowledges the normalcy of their feelings and maintains a rational perspective on the difference between romantic and platonic relationships, suggesting a level of emotional regulation and self-awareness. these elements indicate that the person's experiences and frustrations are more situational and specific rather than indicative of a broader, more pervasive loneliness."
"Basically my life&gt;The Angel that presided ??oer my birth Said, ??Little creature, form??d of Joy and Mirth, ??Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.??",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of joy and contentment, as indicated by the reference to being a creature formed of joy and mirth. the mention of an angel presiding over the birth and encouraging love without reliance on earthly things suggests a sense of inner fulfillment and a positive outlook on life. these elements are not typical indicators of loneliness, as they convey a strong sense of self-sufficiency, happiness, and an inherent ability to find love and joy independently. the absence of expressions of isolation, sadness, or a longing for connection further supports the idea that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative portrays an individual who seems content and self-reliant, which are not characteristics commonly associated with loneliness."
"MiseryI (24f) can??t sleep??. 

My life is so miserable and meaningless. I??m stuck in the past. I??ll never get better.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of misery and hopelessness, with the author expressing difficulty in sleeping and feeling that their life is meaningless. they also mention being stuck in the past and believing they will never improve. while these feelings are indicative of emotional distress, they do not necessarily point to loneliness specifically. instead, the narrative suggests a broader struggle with depression or existential despair. the absence of references to social isolation, lack of companionship, or a desire for social connection makes it less indicative of loneliness. thus, the focus on internal suffering rather than a lack of social relationships aligns with the classification."
"anyone want to chat?It's 5 am and I'm still up for some reason, hoping someone could help pass the time or maybe even help me sleep.",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is awake at an unusual hour and is seeking someone to chat with. this behavior can be common for individuals who may have irregular sleep patterns or simply enjoy late-night conversations. the request for interaction appears casual and not deeply rooted in emotional distress. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a longing for meaningful connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the tone seems light and more about passing the time rather than addressing a deeper need for companionship. the individual's hope for help with sleep also suggests a practical concern rather than an emotional one."
It is really hard to stay motivatedI made a resolution at the beginning of the year to be more confident.  I have honestly made no progress. I have actually gotten worse. Every time I feel I made progress something comes up and I loose all of it. It is really hard to keep this up. I feel I can only reject my self so much.,0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with motivation and self-improvement, specifically regarding confidence. the writer expresses frustration with setbacks and a sense of not making progress, which can be common in personal development journeys. however, the language used, such as ""it is really hard to keep this up"" and ""i feel i can only reject myself so much,"" suggests a focus on self-criticism rather than isolation or a lack of social connection. the absence of references to feelings of social disconnection, loneliness, or longing for companionship indicates that the primary issue lies more with self-esteem and personal goals rather than loneliness."
Feel sadWant to talk,0,"the narrative expresses feelings of sadness and a desire for communication, but these elements alone are not sufficient to indicate loneliness. sadness can stem from various sources such as temporary life events, stress, or emotional fluctuations, without necessarily implying a persistent sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the brevity of the narrative also lacks additional context that would suggest deeper, ongoing loneliness, such as descriptions of feeling misunderstood, chronically isolated, or having a lack of meaningful relationships. therefore, while the desire to talk can be a coping mechanism for sadness, it does not inherently signal the presence of loneliness."
I pushed away all of my co-workers and manager and now I am sad I didn't get a farewell lunch or cakeLul.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual acknowledges their own actions of pushing away co-workers and their manager, which led to a lack of a farewell lunch or cake. while there is an expression of sadness, it seems to be more related to the immediate consequence of their actions rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the person's focus is on the specific event of not receiving a farewell gesture, rather than on a broader feeling of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. this suggests that the sadness is situational and tied to the disappointment of unmet expectations, rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness. the context provided indicates a recognition of cause and effect in their social interactions, which points to a more situational rather than chronic emotional state."
"Researchers Confront An Epidemic Of LonelinessThe woman on the other end of the phone spoke lightheartedly of spring and of her 81st birthday the previous week.

??Who did you celebrate with, Beryl??? asked Alison, whose job was to offer a kind ear.

??No one, I????

And with that, Beryl??s cheer turned to despair.

Her voice began to quaver as she acknowledged that she had been alone at home not just on her birthday, but for days and days. The telephone conversation was the first time she had spoken in more than a week.

About 10,000 similar calls come in weekly to an unassuming office building in this seaside town at the northwest reaches of England, which houses The Silver Line Helpline, a 24-hour call center for older adults seeking to fill a basic need: contact with other people.

Loneliness, which Emily Dickinson described as ??the Horror not to be surveyed,?? is a quiet devastation. But in Britain, it is increasingly being viewed as something more: a serious public health issue deserving of public funds and national attention.

Working with local governments and the National Health Service, programs aimed at mitigating loneliness have sprung up in dozens of cities and towns. Even fire brigades have been trained to inspect homes not just for fire safety but for signs of social isolation.

??There??s been an explosion of public awareness here, from local authorities to the Department of Health to the media,?? said Paul Cann, chief executive of Age UK Oxfordshire and a founder of The Campaign to End Loneliness, a five-year-old group based in London. ??Loneliness has to be everybody??s business.??

Researchers have found mounting evidence linking loneliness to physical illness and to functional and cognitive decline. As a predictor of early death, loneliness eclipses obesity.

??The profound effects of loneliness on health and independence are a critical public health problem,?? said Dr. Carla M. Perissinotto, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. ??It is no longer medically or ethically acceptable to ignore older adults who feel lonely and marginalized.??

In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10 percent to 46 percent.

While the public, private and volunteer sectors in Britain are mobilizing to address loneliness, researchers are deepening their understanding of its biological underpinnings. In a paper published earlier this year in the journal Cell, neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified a region of the brain they believe generates feelings of loneliness. The region, known as the dorsal raphe nucleus, or D.R.N., is best known for its link to depression.

Kay M. Tye and her colleagues found that when mice were housed together, dopamine neurons in the D.R.N. were relatively inactive. But after the mice were isolated for a short period, the activity in those neurons surged when those mice were reunited with other mice.

"An unrequited crush for 5 years which I can't move onHello

This seems stupid that I write here but I need some tips regarding my crush which makes me feel like shit inside. The reason is I can't move on because I don't feel anything for other beautiful girls around me. My heart doesn't flutter or skip a beat for other girls and its been like that for 5 years even tho we didn't meet for 2.5 years already. We didn't do any dates we were people who knew each other from high school, parties, university, domirtory but my akwardness and shyness and stupid things I did when I was drunk fucked it all up which I regret so badly and would do differently just to start my relationship from the beginning. We didn't talk a lot in person, in social media. The last time I talked to her was this summer. What I should do? I still didn't confess to her but it would be akward after such time to write something like that. Problem is I can't get over it and it put brakes to get in relationship with other girls.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual struggling with unrequited love, which has persisted for five years. the person expresses regret over past actions and acknowledges feelings of awkwardness and shyness that have hindered their ability to form a relationship with the object of their affection. despite not seeing or speaking to this person for a significant amount of time, the individual remains fixated on them, unable to develop feelings for others. this fixation and the emotional turmoil it causes are evident in their description of feeling ""like shit inside."" however, the narrative lacks deeper indicators of loneliness, such as a broader sense of social isolation, feelings of emptiness, or a lack of meaningful connections in other areas of life. the focus remains primarily on the unrequited crush rather than an overarching sense of loneliness."
"just like kinda in the need of close friends or smth like this igWell, ig its kind of a long story, somewhat. Im in long distance a relationship since over a year now and i do love her (ig). But sometimes i feel like i cant be the person she needs and i also kinda sometimes feel like she isnt the really right one for me. Things that keep me in the relationship are the fact that i still love her ig, that i cant do it to her because she is mentally absolutely not stable and needs me. Also it would probably be a lot of stress and yes ik, if its just because that i should think about why i actually stay but it just be like that, pls respect that. An other reason is that i kinda feel like I need an emotional relationship with 1 or more persons. Its not like i dont have friends, but i dont have a relationship that would be ""enough"" or whatsoever to call it. The problem with my current gf is that she is something a bit too demanding for me and i cant be there for her enough. Yeah just wanted to share this,  it also took me some energy to write it down.
Anyways, thank you for reading (if any1 actually read this lol) and i hope you have a great rest of your day/night. (Im 16M (16 only for 5 more days lol) if that matters or helps you in any way)
You're an awesome person, especially if you still read this^^",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of ambivalence and emotional complexity typical of someone navigating a long-distance relationship during adolescence. while the author expresses doubts about the relationship's future and mentions the emotional demands placed upon them by their partner, they also highlight having friends and a supportive social network. despite feeling somewhat overwhelmed and questioning the relationship's stability, the author does not exhibit the deep-seated isolation or pervasive sense of loneliness that would typically characterize someone experiencing significant loneliness. the narrative suggests that the author's emotional struggles are more related to the specific dynamics of their romantic relationship rather than a broader sense of social disconnection or loneliness."
"Not even the crisis hotline will respondI know there's a high volume rn and I get it. It's the start of a school year, but that's not what I'm upset about. I texted three friends, hoping to talk to one of them. One responded, but then she fell asleep. Another did and said she was busy. Another didn't respond because I think she was already in bed.

I understand people need to sleep and enjoy life and all that but holy shit I'm like barely keeping it together right now and this is the first time I've resorted to a hotline and they won't even respond. Something about holding off on something for this long only to find out that it's not even an option is very painful.

Things will get better I'm sure but holy shit I'm in a lot of pain rn",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and desperation due to the lack of immediate support from friends and a crisis hotline. the individual acknowledges the reasons behind the unavailability of their friends, which shows an understanding of their circumstances rather than a deep-seated feeling of abandonment. the expression of hope that ""things will get better"" and the awareness that the situation is temporary are indicators of resilience and optimism. despite the acute distress, the individual does not exhibit the chronic sense of isolation or pervasive feeling of disconnection typically associated with loneliness. their efforts to reach out and the expectation of eventual improvement suggest that their current emotional state is situational rather than indicative of a deeper, ongoing loneliness."
uhhwhat do you do when you wanna talk to someone but there's no one to talk to,0,"the narrative reflects a momentary feeling of wanting to communicate but doesn't necessarily indicate a chronic state of loneliness. the phrasing ""uhhwhat do you do"" suggests a casual, perhaps even rhetorical, question rather than a deep expression of ongoing emotional distress. the absence of specific details about prolonged isolation, feelings of sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections points towards a transient experience rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. it's possible the individual is simply experiencing a temporary situation where they are unable to find someone to converse with at that particular moment."
Fuck I miss herAnd I have no idea how the fuck I'm gonna get over her,0,"the narrative expresses intense emotions and a strong reaction to missing someone, which is indicative of a personal loss or heartbreak rather than loneliness. the use of expletives and the focus on one specific person suggest a recent breakup or separation, which can cause feelings of sadness and longing. however, these feelings are not necessarily indicative of chronic loneliness but rather a situational response to a particular event. the narrative lacks broader themes of social isolation or a pervasive sense of disconnection from others, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the focus is singularly on the person they miss, rather than a general feeling of being alone or unsupported."
"I'm in a weird spot sociallyI have known for a long time that I can only seem to make friends online and while that's okay, it's hard. It requires patience, which I'm losing for some reason? I just want a friendship that is a two way street. And someone who can understand, or at the very least listen to what I have to say. I've thought stuff like this is impossible. Am I crazy for believing that?",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is experiencing challenges in forming in-person friendships and is finding solace in online connections. despite these difficulties, the individual expresses a desire for mutual understanding and reciprocal relationships. the mention of losing patience suggests a struggle, but the overall tone does not convey a deep sense of isolation or despair. instead, it reflects a search for meaningful connections and a questioning of their own expectations. the narrative lacks the depth of emotional pain or prolonged solitude that typically signifies loneliness. rather, it highlights a person navigating social complexities with a hopeful outlook for better connections."
"I just don't know any more.The only thing I know is that I'm miserable, sad, and anxious all the time and it's so hard to keep going like this.",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant emotional distress, mentioning feelings of misery, sadness, and anxiety. while these emotions are often associated with loneliness, they can also stem from other psychological conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders. the lack of specific references to isolation or the absence of social connections suggests that the individual's distress might not be primarily due to loneliness. instead, the focus is on their pervasive negative emotional state, which could be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to social isolation. thus, the indicators in this narrative point more towards general emotional suffering rather than loneliness specifically."
"What's it like to feel light...The spiral feels like hell... So dark, heavy, lonely... Sometimes I lay in bed with many tears and wish it could all end even if I have to end it myself.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of despair and darkness, with expressions of feeling heavy and lonely. the mention of laying in bed with tears and contemplating the end of it all, even to the extent of ending it oneself, suggests a deep emotional struggle. however, despite the intense emotions and references to loneliness, the narrative might not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness but rather a temporary state of acute distress or a depressive episode. feelings of loneliness can be situational and tied to specific life events or mental health conditions, which might explain the presence of these intense emotions without indicating a persistent state of loneliness. the language used, such as ""the spiral feels like hell"" and ""so dark, heavy,"" points more towards a moment of crisis rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"Mhmm the feeling of being ghostedLovely isn't it? This question in your head about what you have done wrong to be ghosted every single fucking time. Now excuse me, I'm gonna go cry in a corner.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of frustration and emotional distress related to being ghosted, which is a common experience in social interactions. however, the expression of anger and the specific mention of crying in a corner suggest a reaction to a particular event rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the focus on a singular incident and the use of strong language indicate a situational response rather than an ongoing feeling of isolation. while the narrative does highlight a painful social rejection, it lacks the broader themes of persistent disconnection or a pervasive sense of solitude that are more typical indicators of loneliness."
Why don't I ever feel lonely?I have never really felt lonely but have been alone most of my life. In fact I really like to be alone. Is this weird? I am weird and probably insane. My best friend talks about being lonely all the time and I really can't relate.,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual does not experience loneliness despite being alone for much of their life. they express a preference for solitude and question whether their feelings are unusual, indicating a self-awareness and acceptance of their own emotional state. the mention of a best friend who often feels lonely contrasts with the individual's inability to relate, further highlighting their unique emotional resilience. the absence of distress or longing for social connection, along with the enjoyment of alone time, are key indicators that this person does not experience loneliness. instead, they seem content and comfortable with their solitary lifestyle, which aligns with the classification."
"Should someone with PTSD avoid dating others with mental health issues?I recently tried dating for the first time since being diagnosed with PTSD. I met a girl in a depression/PTSD support group who seemed to be also heavily involved in recovery from addiction and headed in the same direction as far as life trajectory. 

I am graduating from college this week after being homeless from when I was a teenager to a year ago. I started going to college while I  was still homeless and completely broke. I chose to study computers and now have a 3.9GPA, even though I had never even had my own smart phone. My point is that I am extremely motivated and that I work very hard towards my goals...

At first our common background (and supposedly similar goals) brought us together and things were amazing. I was studying computers in college and she had some computer knowledge,  so we bonded by sharing computer code that we were working  on. We also had fun doing sime of the things  neither of us had the chance to enjoy before, including eating nice food, catching up on movies, and taking our dogs to parks.
 
Then I found out she was still involved in illegal activities with some very dangerousand sick people, so it triggered my PTSD to not trust her. I had worked very hard and lost a lot of friends in order to make a clean break from the world she was still very involved in.

She was very understanding and accepting of my symptoms at first ( probably becauseshe realized her complicated life began stressing me out), even saying that my ex girlfriend's shouldbe punished for not being understanding, and things were still not so bad because she promised she was trying to change her life. 

That was until I asked for a little space to work on my college finals right before graduation and I found out what her symptoms were. The minute she thought I was pulling back, she flipped completely, accusing me of being an evil man and all sorts of other things. Where she had been very kind, caring, and talking about forever, she just quit talking completely. When I do hear something from her, she has began using the excuse that my PTSD symptoms were the reason our relationship ended. She takes absolutely no responsibility at all.

Now that some time has passed, I can see that we were both just acting out of fears that still exists from our pasts. She is still not far enough into recovery to understand how her mind works, and even though I am very conscious of my illness and have been successful even with my symptoms, I still do not have 100% control.
 
Since I am starting at a new college soon to pursue my bachelor degree, I should have never been involved with someone who was still involved in drug trafficking, yet I still can't help but wonder what went wrong and I want to avoid making the same mistake. 

Is it even possible for two people with similar mental  illnesses to coexist? I had always thought it would be ideal because the number one thing I am looking for is understanding that sometimes my symptoms are not in my control. I have met some women who say they want to do this, but none that actually can.

Besides having PTSD, I am involved in Yoga, meditation, music, and animals, plus I will have a college degree in Information technology after Friday, and a decent savings account, so it is not like I do not have anything to offer. 

I guess it could be that what matters more is what the individual symptoms of each person are and how well they are managed...or it could just be a bad idea all around for two people with mental illness to date. Would the relationship have lasted longer if she hadn't been selling drugs or if I wasn't trying to go to college? Please, let me know what you think!",0,"the narrative reflects a person who has experienced significant challenges and traumas but has also shown remarkable resilience and determination. the author describes overcoming homelessness, achieving academic success, and maintaining a high gpa despite a lack of prior experience with technology. their involvement in positive activities such as yoga, meditation, music, and caring for animals suggests a proactive approach to mental health and well-being. while the relationship described in the narrative faced difficulties, particularly due to the partner's ongoing illegal activities and the triggering of ptsd symptoms, the author's reflection on the situation demonstrates a level of self-awareness and insight. they recognize the complexities of dating someone with similar mental health issues and express a desire to avoid repeating past mistakes. the narrative does not exhibit the typical indicators of loneliness, such as pervasive feelings of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. instead, it highlights the author's efforts to build a fulfilling life and seek understanding in relationships."
"I think I just cut off my ""friends""They almost never talk to me. Like barely ever outside of school. They barely notice me, then out of the blue, they decide to start fucking with me. For no reason for ither than they were board. Using me as little more than a personal punching bag for their bullshit.
I got very angry. I argued. And I blocked one of them. I dont ever want to talk too them again. But i doubt that I'm going to be able to stop myself.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author has taken decisive action to cut off their friends due to mistreatment. despite the conflict and anger, the individual demonstrates a clear sense of agency and determination to remove negative influences from their life. this suggests a level of self-awareness and assertiveness that is not typically associated with deep loneliness. the fact that the author refers to their friends in quotation marks indicates a recognition that these relationships were not genuinely fulfilling or supportive. the emotional response to being used as a ""personal punching bag"" and the subsequent decision to block one of the friends show that the author values their own well-being and is willing to take steps to protect it. this proactive approach and the ability to identify and reject harmful relationships are indicators that the individual is not experiencing profound loneliness, as they are capable of setting boundaries and seeking healthier interactions."
"Is everyone still meeting people from dating apps with the Corona Virus?Hi everyone, I [20F] haven??t had a successful date from dating apps yet. 

I??m planning on meeting this guy from sweetring but now all of the sudden the corona virus is everywhere, even California and NY are having lockdowns so I was wondering if should meet this guy in person or not. 

Or maybe it??s a sign for me to stop looking for guys?",0,"the narrative reflects concerns about meeting people from dating apps amidst the coronavirus pandemic, which is a common and practical consideration rather than an indication of loneliness. the author expresses hesitation about meeting someone due to health and safety concerns, which is a rational response to the situation. they also mention planning to meet someone from a dating app, indicating active engagement in social activities and a desire to connect with others. the tone of the narrative suggests a thoughtful approach to dating rather than a sense of isolation or loneliness. the mention of considering whether to stop looking for guys seems more like a contemplation of safety rather than a withdrawal from social interaction. overall, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness such as feelings of isolation, lack of social engagement, or emotional distress."
I am nonexistent[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of nonexistence, but this brief statement lacks the depth and context typically associated with feelings of loneliness. loneliness often involves a detailed expression of emotional pain, social isolation, or a longing for connection, which are not present in this narrative. the absence of specific references to social interactions, feelings of being left out, or a desire for companionship suggests that the statement might be more related to existential or identity issues rather than loneliness. therefore, the narrative does not provide sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of loneliness."
Anyone in the Bay Area?[removed],0,"the narrative indicates an individual reaching out to others in a specific geographic area, which suggests a desire for social connection. however, the brevity and straightforwardness of the message do not convey any deeper emotional distress or feelings of isolation. typically, narratives from lonely individuals contain more explicit expressions of sadness, longing, or descriptions of their solitary experiences. in this case, the message appears more practical and casual, lacking the emotional depth or context that would indicate loneliness. the person's inquiry is direct and lacks any signs of desperation or underlying emotional need, which are common indicators of loneliness."
To EveryoneI want to give you all a hug like a good dad (even tho I'm 20) and just help everyone. Dont be afraid to pm! Be safe and remember you are all worth alot more than you think,0,"the narrative reflects a tone of compassion and outreach, indicative of someone who is emotionally available and empathetic towards others. the author's desire to give hugs and offer help suggests a sense of connectedness and a strong social support network. phrases like ""don't be afraid to pm"" and ""you are all worth a lot more than you think"" demonstrate a proactive approach to engaging with others and providing emotional support. these elements are typical of individuals who feel secure in their social relationships and possess a sense of purpose in their interactions with others, which are not common indicators of loneliness."
"I need more people to talk toHello, if anyone is interested I have been looking for a sweet gf that I could just love and be goofy with ???????? im m16",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses an interest in finding a romantic partner and engaging in playful, loving behavior, which is a common desire among teenagers. the casual tone and use of emojis suggest a lighthearted approach rather than a deep sense of isolation. while seeking companionship can be associated with loneliness, the context here appears to be more about normal teenage exploration of relationships rather than a profound feeling of being alone. the request for more people to talk to could simply reflect a typical adolescent's desire for expanding their social circle rather than an indicator of loneliness."
"In conclusionAlways being a gentleman to girl results in her seeing you as a friend. Where as always joking with a girl will only get her to ignore you. So screw it, I??m just gonna face the fact that I will never have a girlfriend.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and resignation rather than loneliness. the author discusses their experiences with girls and the outcomes of their interactions, which indicates a level of social engagement and an attempt to form relationships. the statement ""i'm just gonna face the fact that i will never have a girlfriend"" suggests a specific disappointment in romantic endeavors rather than a broader feeling of social isolation. while the author might feel disheartened about their romantic prospects, they do not exhibit classic signs of loneliness such as a pervasive sense of isolation, lack of social connections, or deep emotional distress. instead, their focus is on the perceived futility of their efforts in a specific social context."
how can you have friends when you're mentally ill?[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a struggle with forming friendships due to mental illness, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the question posed reflects a concern about social connections, yet it lacks explicit expressions of isolation or emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe feelings of emptiness, longing for companionship, or explicit mention of being alone. in this case, the narrative seems more focused on the challenge of mental illness as a barrier to friendship rather than an expression of loneliness itself. the absence of detailed personal experiences of isolation or a sense of yearning for social interaction points towards the individual grappling with mental health issues rather than loneliness."
Anyone want to play pc or ps5 games together online? I'm PST time and looking for someone or a group to join[removed],0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is actively seeking social interaction and connection through online gaming. this behavior is typical of someone who is socially engaged and interested in forming connections with others. the mention of specific gaming platforms and time zone indicates a clear intention to find like-minded individuals to share experiences with, which is a proactive approach to socialization. rather than displaying signs of isolation or emotional distress, the narrative reflects an openness to community and collaboration. these elements are indicative of someone who is not experiencing loneliness, as they are reaching out and making efforts to connect with others in a shared activity."
"Here is one to ponder.My only interactions are now limited to the cashier asking me if I want paper or plastic, cash or credit.",0,"the narrative describes limited social interactions, specifically mentioning exchanges with a cashier. while this could suggest a lack of social engagement, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the absence of expressed feelings of isolation or emotional distress is notable. some individuals may be content with minimal social contact, finding fulfillment in other areas of their lives. without additional context or indications of negative emotions, the narrative alone does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude the presence of loneliness. the description might simply reflect a preference for solitude or a period of temporary reduced social activity."
It really do be like thisI feel so empty man. I don??t like this at all. What a fucking shit of a day.,0,"the narrative expresses feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction, particularly highlighting a negative day. however, the brevity and intensity of the language suggest a momentary frustration rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the use of strong expletives and the casual tone indicate a venting of temporary emotions rather than a deeper, ongoing isolation. typically, loneliness narratives involve more detailed descriptions of prolonged solitude, a lack of meaningful connections, or a pervasive sense of being misunderstood. in this case, the narrative lacks these elements, focusing instead on an immediate, transient emotional state."
"One of those days...Got to thinking about romance again... the one thing I can??t hack my way around some way or another (besides money lol). Not usually a problem but sometimes I miss how things were when I had a gf. Not enough to (consciously) go after a girl, but enough to make my day a little less happy. Tough.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of reflection and mild nostalgia rather than profound loneliness. the individual mentions thinking about romance and missing having a girlfriend, which suggests a normal human experience of occasional longing for past relationships. however, they also acknowledge that this feeling isn't strong enough to motivate them to actively seek out a new relationship. this indicates a level of contentment or acceptance with their current situation. the mention of making their day ""a little less happy"" suggests a minor, fleeting sadness rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. overall, the narrative captures a brief, manageable emotional dip rather than a deeper, ongoing struggle with loneliness."
"I just want to be loved :(I just want someone to love me, like I would love them.... until the end of time",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for love and companionship, which is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the longing for a reciprocal loving relationship is a natural aspect of emotional life and can be present even in individuals who are not experiencing loneliness. the use of phrases like ""i just want to be loved"" and ""until the end of time"" suggests a deep yearning for connection, but it does not provide enough evidence of the pervasive sense of isolation or social disconnection typically associated with loneliness. rather, it reflects a universal wish for meaningful and enduring relationships."
Don??t you hate it when you try to text friends but no matter how hard you try you only got 3 word repliesIt sucks since the only time I??ve gotten a text from a friend was just a question on a homework assignment so that doesn??t count. Also when I try to text my friends I just get 3 word replies.,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing frustration with their social interactions, particularly through text messaging. they mention receiving minimal responses from friends and feeling that the only engagement they get is related to homework, which they dismiss as not counting as genuine interaction. however, the key indicators here point towards a sense of dissatisfaction with the quality of communication rather than an overarching feeling of loneliness. the frustration seems to stem more from unmet expectations in social interactions rather than a profound sense of isolation. the focus on the specifics of texting and the repeated emphasis on the brevity of replies suggest an annoyance with the medium of communication rather than a deeper emotional void. this indicates that while the individual may be experiencing social dissatisfaction, it does not necessarily equate to the broader, more pervasive feeling of loneliness."
"Yesterday was the worst day everOne of my very few online friends hates me for no reason, I'm still single since my online GF broke up with me a while back and ignored me - which I'm used to but still, etc. I just feel like bursting into tears for some reason ./",0,"the narrative describes a series of unfortunate events and emotional distress, such as feeling hated by an online friend and experiencing a breakup. however, these experiences alone do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions having online friends, even if few, which suggests some level of social connection. the expression of sadness and frustration is a natural response to personal setbacks and does not inherently imply a pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness. the context of the narrative reflects situational emotional pain rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
"I dont know what to do anymore.I've never had any relationships in my 15 years of being alive, ive always been the unattractive guy who gets looked over. I get dumped on all the time and I feel like I won't ever be good enough. My family and friends tell me to be myself but nobody shows any interest in me. I just long for someone to love, love me. To hug a girl that I love, the warmth. But it's so cold. I feel like just giving up, I try so hard to be these different people who just aren't me. I don't even know who I am anymore. I thought if I got a better body then things might change, but nobody seems to notice. I want to be a father one day, I want to raise a kid. But what if I never find the one? I know that I'm only 15 and I have so much more time but I cant wait any longer. I'm so desperate. I dont know if love is in the cards for me. Any advice would be great, I need help.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional distress and a longing for connection. the individual describes feelings of being overlooked and unattractive, leading to a lack of relationships despite their efforts to change themselves. they express a desire for love and physical affection, highlighting a sense of coldness and isolation. the mention of trying to be different people and not knowing their true self indicates a struggle with identity and self-worth. while the narrative is filled with despair and a plea for help, it also contains a glimmer of hope for the future, as the individual acknowledges their young age and the potential for change. these elements are typical indicators of someone grappling with feelings of loneliness and a deep yearning for meaningful connections."
Off work today could use someone to chat withAs the titles says anyone interested,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is simply looking for someone to chat with due to having a day off from work. the lack of detailed emotional expression or deeper context about feelings of isolation implies that this is a casual request for social interaction rather than a cry for help or a sign of deeper loneliness. it is common for people to seek company or conversation when they have free time, and this behavior does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the straightforward and brief nature of the message, along with the absence of language indicating distress or sadness, supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
"Not many classes on today.During that extra free time, I'm going to go buy a sandwich, sit on the beach and eat it, while hoping I find someone I click with soon. Feel out of place most of the time :/",0,"the narrative describes a person's plan for their free time, which includes buying a sandwich and sitting on the beach. while the individual mentions feeling out of place most of the time, this sentiment does not dominate the overall tone of the narrative. the person's proactive approach to spending their time, such as going to the beach and having a meal, suggests engagement with their environment and a willingness to enjoy solitary activities. the hope of finding someone to connect with soon indicates an openness to social interaction, rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation. these aspects collectively suggest that the individual is not deeply entrenched in loneliness but rather experiencing a common, transient feeling of not fitting in perfectly at times."
Just feeling by myself.If anyone wants to talk just lemme know,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but it doesn't necessarily indicate deep loneliness. the phrase ""just feeling by myself"" could simply reflect a momentary state rather than a chronic feeling of isolation. the openness to conversation with ""if anyone wants to talk just lemme know"" shows a proactive attitude towards connecting with others, which is less typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness. often, individuals who are deeply lonely may feel more hopeless about their social situation and less inclined to reach out or expect others to engage. the casual tone and willingness to communicate suggest a transient feeling rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
"What do you think of religion?Have anyone thought about joining church? It's essentialy a community of people who care about each other. When I broke up with my ex, she joined the church and it seems like that it helped her a lot. Members of church took care of her.

I'm actually anti-religion myself, but I think it may be solution for other lonely people. Or not? What do you think?",0,"the narrative reflects an analytical and somewhat detached perspective on the topic of religion and community. the author discusses the potential benefits of joining a church, particularly in the context of their ex-partner finding support after a breakup. however, the tone remains objective and speculative rather than personal and emotional. the writer acknowledges the supportive nature of religious communities but does not express a personal longing for connection or describe feelings of isolation. instead, they maintain a critical stance towards religion, suggesting an intellectual curiosity rather than a personal need for social support. this detachment and lack of personal emotional disclosure are indicative of someone who is not currently experiencing loneliness."
I can??t stop cryingPlease help me,0,"the narrative reflects a state of acute emotional distress rather than loneliness. the plea for help and the inability to stop crying suggest an immediate, overwhelming emotional response, which could be due to a variety of factors such as grief, trauma, or a crisis situation. these expressions indicate a need for immediate support and intervention but do not necessarily imply a prolonged sense of isolation or disconnection from others. while loneliness often involves a chronic feeling of being alone and disconnected, this narrative is more indicative of an urgent, situational distress that requires immediate attention rather than the ongoing experience of loneliness."
I want to talk to all people who feel super lonely. We can be homies[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a desire to connect with others who might be experiencing loneliness, suggesting a proactive and positive approach to forming relationships. the use of the term ""homies"" indicates a casual and friendly tone, implying the author feels capable of creating bonds and is not currently overwhelmed by loneliness. this kind of outreach typically reflects a sense of agency and social confidence, which are not commonly associated with profound loneliness. instead, it suggests the author is looking to expand their social circle and provide support, rather than seeking help for their own isolation."
"Long-Lived Non-Human CompanionshipI posted most of this as a reply to someone else somewhere, but I thought maybe it would be interesting for other people to read in general so I'm sharing it as a regular post.

Finding human friends and consistent, stable, enduring human relationships is hard. We all know that.

One popular alternative to this is acquiring animal companionship. Lots of lonely people get pets, and it can help a ton. Many different scientific studies have concluded that owning pets can improve your life, increase longevity, and decrease loneliness. And through the wonderful magic of Stockholm Syndrome, you can force your less-intelligent animal companion to love and depend upon you the way you just can't with most humans (not legally, anyway).

But... what about when they die? Won't that leave you feeling even lonelier than before? Just the thought of this, or past traumatic experiences, can scare a lot of lonely people off of the idea of getting themselves a furry friend (though as seen below, our bias toward furriness may be part of the problem as feathery and scaly friends tend to last longer). Dogs are called ""man's best friend,"" but... most of them only live for 10-13 years and many popular ""pure"" breeds suffer numerous genetic problems that makes old age for them a painful ordeal. And puppy farms in some places can be a living nightmare.

Myself I'm more of a cat person. I've had several very close, loving relationships with kitties. They can be much more affectionate and personable than some believe (not cat people), and the fact that they are usually harder to win over than dogs (the emotional sluts of the animal kingdom) I think can make it feel like their love is more earned and therefore more valuable. Plus they are largely self-sufficient and easy to take care of. And most kinds of housecat, well taken care of, can live up to 20 years! That's a long time! But still... probably not as long as you're going to live.

If you do decide to get a dog or cat, please adopt one from the pound or an animal shelter. There are many in need.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you want an animal companion that is going to last longer, here are some suggestions:

&amp;#x200B;

\*

Horses - some breeds can live 40-60 years. And you can ride them! Not advisable to try this with most dogs. The Icelandic Horse is known for its hardiness and for being energetic and friendly. Not for everyone, obviously, as maintenance can be expensive. But they are beautiful, noble animals that many humans have formed strong bonds with. Don't get one unless you're willing to commit large amounts of time to grooming and maintenance though, or else large amounts of money to pay someone else to do it. Though horse grooming can be very zen. I used to get the same feeling from washing, waxing, and detailing my sports car.

Asian Elephants - hard and expensive to care for, but they live on average from 50-70 years and the oldest on record died at age 84. You're probably not going to be able to get one unless you are Joe Exotic or live in a farm somewhere in Thailand or else some place with unusually lax laws, but if you do, they can make for great friends because elephants are some of the most intelligent animals on the planet along with humans, dolphins, whales, crows, and maybe octopoda - though octopus intelligence is not well understood. Btw some species of whale also can live super long but... not in captivity... and I doubt your fish tank is big enough.

Blue and Yellow Macaws - on average these beautiful and intelligent birds live to be about 80. In captivity many different breeds of parrots have been known to live 90-100 years or longer. And they make excellent pets! Probably the best overall option on this whole list with lifespans that conveniently match the average life expectancy of a human, so you could get a baby macaw as a child and have a lifelong companion that you wouldn't have to worry about abandoning yourself whenever you kick the bucket. One note: I'd strongly urge anyone considering getting a parrot as a pet to do your due diligence and ensure your feathery friend has been ethically sourced. There is still a lot of illegal trafficking of exotic birds to various parts of the world, which is awful for the birds.

Aldabra Giant Tortoise - the oldest one on record lived to be 255. Many species of tortoise commonly live to be 100-150, perhaps thanks to their very slow metabolism. Smaller, more common species are very popular as pets, easy to obtain, and cheap to care for as they eat simple food and not much of it. Plus if they ever get outside and try to run off you'll have a much easier time catching them than you would a dog or a cat.

Lobsters - they can live to be 100-150 years old and will be forever thankful to you for sparing them the fate of becoming someone's expensive dinner. Many types of shellfish and mollusks have similarly long or even longer lifespans, some living for several hundred years.

Greenland Shark - not the prettiest species of shark, but perhaps due to their preference for arctic waters they are the longest-lived extant species, with estimated lifespans of 200 up to over 500 years. And sharks are cool. They've been around for 450 million years so they must be doing something right. Don't trust that slanderous Hollywood hack job Jaws. One caveat about the Greenland Shark: they grow to 24 feet long, so unless you have a very big, very cold fish tank or swimming pool this probably isn't a realistic option for a pet. On the other hand, the smallest common aquarium shark, the Dwarf Shark, suffers significantly less than the Greenland Shark in the looks department, only grows to about 8 inches long, and still lives for an impressive 20-30 years.

Sponges, corals, anemones and tubeworms - not the most interactive of pets, but they are technically animals, some are nice to look at, and some species can live for thousands of years.

Turritopsis dohrnii - also known as the ""immortal jellyfish,"" it is thought that it may be biologically immortal, meaning that it will *never* die from old age, thanks to its ability to switch back and forth between its pupal and adult stages of development. Some species of hydras also have this talent. But the immortal jellyfish is actually quite beautiful and could make nice pets I guess. Though they are tiny so you will have to invest in a magnifying glass to fully appreciate their company.",0,"the narrative discusses various types of long-lived non-human companionship and the benefits of having pets. the author provides detailed information about different animals, including their lifespans and care requirements, suggesting alternatives to more common pets like dogs and cats. while the narrative acknowledges the difficulty of forming lasting human relationships and the potential for loneliness, it focuses more on practical solutions and the benefits of pet ownership. the tone is informative and practical rather than emotionally charged, indicating that the author is more interested in sharing knowledge and advice than expressing feelings of loneliness. the emphasis on the practical aspects of pet care and the benefits of long-lived animal companions suggests a proactive approach to life rather than a focus on emotional struggles."
Message me if you're sad43 yo mum of 2 who knows what it's like,0,"the narrative reflects an empathetic and supportive individual who offers help to others, suggesting a sense of connection and purpose. the mention of being a ""43 yo mum of 2"" indicates a family role that often involves regular social interactions and responsibilities, which can mitigate feelings of loneliness. the phrase ""knows what it is like"" implies personal experience with sadness, but it is framed in a way that shows understanding and readiness to assist others rather than focusing on personal isolation. these elements point towards an individual who is engaged with others and likely has a support system, which are key indicators of non-loneliness."
Feel like all I do is sit on reddit these daysIf anyone needs anyone to talk to I'm free. My sleeping pattern is buggered so I'll be up all night,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of availability and willingness to connect with others, which can indicate a desire for social interaction rather than loneliness. the author mentions spending time on reddit and offers to talk to anyone who needs someone, showing an openness to communication. while the disrupted sleeping pattern might suggest some level of distress, the proactive approach to seeking interaction implies a level of engagement with the outside world. these elements point towards someone who may be experiencing boredom or a need for more structured social activities rather than profound loneliness."
I need some advice pleaseCan someone text me right now I just need someone to talk. I feel like shit right now I dont know what should I do,0,"the narrative suggests a moment of acute distress and a need for immediate support, but it does not necessarily indicate a chronic state of loneliness. the individual is reaching out for help, which shows they believe there are people available to provide support. this implies a level of social connectivity and trust in others. the language used, while expressing a need for advice and emotional relief, doesn't reflect the deeper, persistent feelings of isolation and disconnection that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it seems more situational, possibly related to a specific event or problem that has caused temporary emotional turmoil. the urgency in their plea for someone to text them right now suggests they are accustomed to receiving responses and are confident that someone will be there for them in this moment of need."
I got into a big argument with my girlfriend and broke up 8 days ago.She doesn??t want to talk to me anymore and has blocked me on all social media and text messages. I??m now drunk and listening to sad music. I don??t want to be alive.,0,"the narrative describes a recent breakup and the individual's subsequent emotional distress, including being blocked on social media and engaging in behaviors such as drinking and listening to sad music. while these experiences are undoubtedly painful and indicative of acute emotional turmoil, they do not necessarily point to chronic loneliness. the immediate context suggests a reaction to a specific event rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the person's feelings of despair and statements about not wanting to be alive are serious and warrant attention, but they are more aligned with acute grief and situational depression rather than long-term loneliness."
"I always see posts saying ""Please share it""... and I don't know anyone to share it with. O.o :/.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of detachment from social media interactions, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""i do not know anyone to share it with"" might suggest a lack of immediate social connections, yet it is framed in a casual and almost humorous tone, indicated by the emoticons ""o.o"" and "":/."" these symbols often imply a light-hearted or non-serious attitude rather than deep emotional distress. the narrative lacks expressions of sadness, isolation, or a desire for meaningful social interaction, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it seems to reflect a simple, matter-of-fact statement about the user's social media habits without deeper emotional undertones."
"Here if anyone needs to talk!????????????Having a pretty rough day today, I'd love to listen to your problems and try my best to help (it distracts me from my own issues). The offers there if anyone wants to take it up ???? I hope everyone's day is going a little brighter than mine. For anyone that needs to hear it, I love you and I am unbelievably proud of you. Even if you feel like you haven't achieved anything, I promise that you have and I really am so fucking proud of you for continuing to keep pushing every day. I know being alive is a burden sometimes (or most of the time) but you're doing an amazing job so far and you are valued. You're important to me. I'm here if you ever need some love and compassion. Stay safe please ??????",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of empathy and a desire to connect with others, which are typical indicators of someone who is not experiencing loneliness. the author offers support and encouragement to others, suggesting they have a social support system and a sense of purpose in helping others. their willingness to listen to others' problems and provide emotional support indicates a level of social engagement and emotional resilience. while they mention having a rough day, their focus remains on uplifting others and providing reassurance, which is not characteristic of someone who feels isolated or disconnected. the narrative conveys a message of solidarity and compassion, reinforcing the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
"His Eulogy.       My father isn't actually dead. In fact he is very much alive and unwell living in a van a days drive away from me. However, as he becomes older and weaker from years of drugs, sex and rock n roll I find myself making adjustments to his eulogy. 
      Yes, you read that correctly. A eulogy for a man that is still alive. I'd give anything to meet just one child of an addict that hasn't already thought about what they will......and won't say when that fateful day arrives. The day I have to stand up in front of a room full of people that he endlessly disappointed and find the strength to do right by him. Because the funny thing is I fucking love my addict father. We have almost identical minds I just never behaved......well to the degree of recklessness that he did. 
     Since I've been using Reddit as my journal lately it only seemed fitting to put everything here. I won't get to say all of this to them. I want to get up there and steadily hold up both of my middle fingers and scream ""FUCK YOU for giving up. FUCK YOU for leaving. And finally FUCK YOU for showing up today with your small minds and judgmental stares"". But I wont. I won't because my father's reckless behavior gave me a sister. A tiny impressionable human I am now mentally responsible for. I'll do everything in my power to preserve her mind for as long as I can. No one gave me that courtesy. So here it is in all of its current unfiltered unapologetic glory. 

My Father's Eulogy:

     For 28 years I had my father all to myself and I loved being his only child. He was so in love with me and I don't think there has ever been anyone that has loved me that much. But then came my baby sister. I struggled her first few years with accepting that I no longer had him to myself. But one day he called me and there she was on a video chat. I realized almost instantly that this tiny 5 year old girl had my nose. That's all it took. I was attached. 
      My baby sister is the greatest gift my father has ever given me. I knew that he would pass so much earlier in her life than mine and I promised him I would watch over her for the rest of my life. She will never walk alone. 
      It's no secret to anyone here that my father was a life long drug addict. Over time the people in his life gave up on him one by one. But I was one of the chosen few who got to see his soul. Who he really was beneath the stories that others told of him. I promised myself that I would get up here and do right by him. Tell you all who my father really was and why I am so proud to be his daughter. 
     He taught me to respect animals just as much as humans and got me a lot of fuzzy ones over the years. He gave me 2 kittens, a dog, a bunny and he even drove 8 hours from Maryland to Massachusetts to deliver my hamster ""Flopsy"" as a communion gift. He taught me how to sneak into movies and we once saw 6 in one day. He taught me how to drive and how to make it up a snowy hill with a stick shift. He was great at driving in the snow. Always calm and never panicked. 
    We made each other laugh until our stomachs hurt and tears rolled from our eyes. He was so funny. He was a talented musician playing guitar and singing in my youth and later turned to drums when his hands couldn't handle the guitar anymore. He taught me how to play guitar when I was 6 and bought me my first and only pair of diamond earrings when I was 16. And no I dont care how he got the money. People have attempted to sway my opinion of my father over the years. But I've never faltered in what I know to be his truth. 
    The truth is he was the only person who ever really knew me. Because our minds worked the same way. He gave me the gift of empathy and compassion. He knew how to comfort me, what to say to me, what not to say to me and how to be everything I needed in whatever situation I was in. 
   Every night I stayed with him (which was weekends and summers) he would sing me to sleep with his mashed up version of Bob Dylan's knocking on heavens door that included parts of the Guns and Roses cover. I remember what it felt like being rocked to sleep by him. His deep singing voice coming through his chest onto my cheek as I laid against him.
   A part of me is now gone and the hole that is now in my heart will never be filled. But in many ways I don't think I would want it to be mended. Because that reminds me of just how much he meant to me. Just how much his mere existence mattered. I will miss his sunny side up breakfasts and how he'd get so upset if he broke a yolk. I will miss our long talks where he would make me feel heard and never attempted to stifle my voice. As most of you know I talk loudly, fastly and way too much. But I was never told to be more quiet, to slow my speech down or to stop talking all together. I'm not sure he knew how much that meant to me. 
    He saw my flaws as gifts. As things to be proud of. He saw the good in everyone. And I mean everyone. He taught me how to fold a wad of cash properly with the one dollar bills on the outside and the 20's on the inside so potential robbers would assume I was broke. He taught me to buy the biggest pack of sharpies to make sure I had every color in case I dinged someone's car door I could just color it in.
    These may sound like terrible things to teach a child. But I assure you it was never done with malice or poor intent. He was doing everything in his power to prepare me for the world to chew me up and spit me out like it did to him. I will forever be grateful to know the absurd yet useful things he taught me. 
    I'm scared of what life is now without him in it. But I wouldn't change a single late night drive, 3 hour phone conversation or the fact that he wore cut off jean shorts to bed every night like a hillbilly. I feel as though it would have been an easier choice to let the sharp broken pieces he'd crumbled into lay. However, as his daughter I made the decision to walk through the fire with him and I would do it over and over again. My only regret is that he won't be here to watch me say FUCK ALL OF YOU. Daddy, I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again. I love you.

"I get attached too easily.I completely understand why this happens, i know when I'm doing it, and i'm completely powerless to stop it everytime. I have the deepest need for someone in my life that i can be close to, that when a person shows a small amount of interest in me, i latch on to them, i know it's really unhealthy and everytime I see myself getting to that point i have to try and pull away.

I feel like i'm in this painful cycle of being drawn to people who don't care, and In the end of it all i always wish for silly childish shit like wanting to turn off my emotions. But i really wish i could put these feelings aside so i can focus on things that should be more important to me.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep self-awareness and understanding of one's emotional patterns, which indicates a high level of introspection. the individual expresses a strong desire for close relationships and acknowledges the unhealthy nature of their attachment tendencies. despite experiencing recurring emotional pain and disappointment, there is an evident effort to manage these feelings and prioritize other aspects of life. the individual's ability to recognize and articulate their emotional struggles, as well as their wish to redirect focus, suggests resilience and a proactive approach to personal growth. while the narrative describes significant emotional challenges, the presence of self-reflection and a desire for improvement are positive indicators that the individual is not necessarily consumed by loneliness."

What would you choose?",0,"the narrative discusses a significant life decision about moving to south korea and choosing between a rural or urban setting for a teaching job. the author is weighing the pros and cons of each option, expressing concern about potential isolation in both environments. however, the focus is on making a practical decision rather than expressing feelings of loneliness. the use of ""mentally though, which would be better?"" suggests a consideration of mental well-being, but it does not indicate a current state of loneliness. the narrative is more about planning and anticipation of future circumstances rather than reflecting on current emotional experiences. the tone is pragmatic and forward-looking, typical of someone who is not experiencing loneliness but is instead preparing for an upcoming change."

I know how loneliness can kill you slowly from the inside out. It only takes one person to talk to and care for your world to change and make a difference. I want to be a person who inspires hope, positivity, growth, and change in others. It means a lot to me if I can help others as I know we all have our own struggles and stories to overcome.

Love is a two way street no matter how much you pave over it. And I??d hate to say it but: I don??t think relationships are meant for me.....I honestly think it??s okay for me to give up on something that was never bound to happen.. just because I??m important to someone doesn??t mean that I should fall in love with them......",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-awareness and acceptance of one's situation in the realm of relationships. the author acknowledges their pattern of forming attachments with individuals who only see them as friends and recognizes the unhealthiness of their obsession with trying to turn these friendships into romantic relationships. they express an understanding that love is mutual and cannot be forced, indicating a realistic perspective on relationships. despite the disappointments and the harsh lessons learned, the author seems to have reached a point of acceptance, recognizing that it is okay to give up on the idea of a romantic relationship if it is not reciprocated. this acceptance and the rational evaluation of their experiences suggest a level of emotional resilience and self-compassion, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. rather, they show a person who is grappling with and processing their emotions in a healthy manner."
I can??t stop cryingJUST TWLK TO ME,0,"the narrative indicates a moment of acute emotional distress, marked by the inability to stop crying and a desperate plea for someone to talk to them. while these expressions might suggest immediate feelings of sadness or a need for support, they do not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. acute emotional reactions can be situational and triggered by specific events, such as a recent loss or conflict, rather than a persistent state of loneliness. the brevity of the message and the focus on immediate emotional release and communication might point to a temporary need for connection rather than an ongoing experience of social isolation. thus, while the narrative reveals a moment of intense emotion, it lacks the broader context of sustained disconnection or prolonged feelings of being alone that are more characteristic of loneliness."

"A Man Could Go Quite MadBasically, I have a lot going on. I'm Autistic, have ADHD, and have DIAGNOSED Anxiety. I've been losing touch with reality lately and I've started to honestly not care if I live or die. Part of me even hopes I have *cancer*. I'm constantly in pain and the only thing that stopped me from committing suicide last week was the knowledge that I would get to eat *popcorn* later in the day. I don't have many friends, and I don't have any friends that I actively meet up with anymore. The only thing that used to keep me going was the knowledge that if I kept going I could have a good future, but even that motivation left. Then my only motivation was funny videos on youtube, and that's all it is anymore. My memory just keeps getting worse and worse to the point that, like I said before, I'm losing touch with reality.

I'm currently eating some popcorn on my couch with the laptop on my lap. For some reason, popcorn is pretty much my only bliss anymore.

my whole life is a lie????,0,"the narrative presents a brief and ambiguous expression of confusion or realization, which can be interpreted in various ways. the phrase ""my whole life is a lie????"" suggests a moment of existential questioning or a significant discovery that challenges the narrator's perception of their life. however, it lacks specific details that would indicate a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include descriptions of social isolation, feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected from others, and a longing for meaningful relationships. in this case, the statement does not provide enough context or emotional depth to suggest these indicators. instead, it could reflect a temporary state of shock or disbelief rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"Help i think im quirkyIdk what to do yall...  why is being awkward my only way of being?
Any tips are welcome",0,"the narrative suggests a person seeking advice on dealing with feelings of awkwardness and self-perception as quirky. while the individual expresses a desire for improvement and openness to tips, there is no indication of deeper emotional distress or isolation typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on self-improvement and social behavior, which points more towards a concern with self-image rather than a lack of meaningful connections. the use of casual language and the direct appeal for advice from others also implies a level of social engagement and support, further suggesting that the person is not experiencing significant loneliness."

Let's pair up and chat, just would be nice to hear someone's story and about their lives. maybe conversation can provide relief",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual is at work and acknowledges a distraction caused by their own thoughts, which is a common experience for many people. the invitation to chat and hear someone else's story reflects a normal human inclination towards social engagement and curiosity about others. rather than expressing feelings of isolation or distress, the narrative conveys a proactive approach to connecting with others. the mention of pairing up and finding relief through conversation can be seen as a healthy coping mechanism for managing everyday stress or boredom, rather than a sign of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the depth of emotional pain or social disconnection typically associated with loneliness."
"Always asked why I message so oftenEvery relationship I'd had, there always comes a time (Not always within it) sometimes it comes out after the breakup where it's basically ""Why do you message me so often? Or you talk too much""  whether said directly that way or not.

Not once, but 5 times, all of them. Mind you I'd try to back off at that point if we're still together, but then it turns into ""I don't think I'm the person for you, or I'm not ready for a relationship right now"" either which every time.

This last time it was my ex randomly telling me over a year and a half after us breaking up that yesterday, because he woke up to 4 messages from me (1 news article, 2 memes and one was just asking what almond milk he buys) that it was overwhelming for him, and of course it brought up all this past defeat, and burned me worse than before because I thought he was THE ONE who would never say it.

He said it. I'm 5/5 at this point. What am I doing so wrong? One second it's why do you message me so much, I go quiet ""What's wrong? Somethings off?""

I can't win, and it's normal to send content/memes where you find it no? (INSTA, Twitter, Facebook, snap, etc.. so that's why it was 4 seperate over the span of """"2 hours"" he quoted.

I'm so hurt, and I feel like I'm going to be alone forever because I'd rather not just risk being told to shut up again when I'm just excited to share my life and things I find with someone.

I'll be quiet for now tho, thanks ????",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with understanding and managing communication boundaries in relationships. despite experiencing repeated feedback about their messaging frequency, the person continues to seek connection through frequent sharing of content, which is a common behavior in healthy social interactions. however, the consistent theme of being told they message too much and the subsequent feeling of rejection may indicate a mismatch in communication styles rather than a deep-seated loneliness. their desire to share and connect, even after facing criticism, suggests resilience and a proactive approach to maintaining relationships. the expression of hurt and confusion about how to balance their enthusiasm for sharing with others' preferences highlights a challenge in relational dynamics rather than an intrinsic sense of isolation."
"Another failed tinder layYeah, it??s just like the title says.

Then he said he might not be able to come and then obviously after I shaved - and I hate shaving but he said he liked it and I thought I could make it extra nice even though I hate it - I saw the text where he said he couldn??t come. 
So yeah. I??m not even good enough for a lay. 
You??d think that after all this time without s*x for both of us, he would give an excuse and come since he knew I was ready and willing but no.

When i go to them, they pretend and act like they care, but when we arent playing a game together or something, not once do they do something as simple as go ??hey you doing ok?? when im clearly not doing ok.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of frustration and disappointment with the perceived insincerity of friends, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a sense of betrayal and unmet expectations, which are common in relationships where one feels undervalued. however, the mention of playing games together suggests that the person still engages in social activities and maintains some level of interaction with their friends. the core issue appears to be a lack of emotional support rather than isolation. this distinction is crucial because it highlights the presence of social connections, albeit flawed, rather than a complete absence of companionship."
"Lost all motivation in lifeI??m 21 year old female and I seriously and unironically lost my will to live. Currently i??m heavily slacking at school and in my free time lay in bed doing nothing or mindlessly scrolling reddit or sleeping. I??m honestly just over life and can??t wait for it to end. I would seriously lose nothing if I didn??t wake up from sleep. I don??t know why i??m here typing this and not sure what I will gain from it, of course I will not end my life but I would not mind if it did.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation, which are critical indicators of depression rather than loneliness. the individual mentions slacking at school, spending free time unproductively, and experiencing a pervasive sense of apathy towards life. these symptoms suggest a severe depressive state. while loneliness can sometimes accompany depression, the key aspects here—such as the loss of will to live, pervasive apathy, and lack of interest in activities—are more directly aligned with depressive symptoms. there is no explicit mention of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative focuses more on internal struggles and a desire for life to end, which are hallmarks of depression."
"The Heart of a WomanThe heart of the female is gentle. It??s loving care just like so. It??s love knows no limits. It carries just as the winds blow. The heart of the woman can know so much pain. Yet still rise again. It chooses to believe in what??s right. To be encouraged??no matter how its broken again. The heart of the woman is kind. The love she holds so sweet. Her beautiful words of life and grace, speak such joy into the man she meets. The heart of the woman attracts her truest friend. She cares for them. She??s there for them.

PLEASE TALK TO ME[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a straightforward and direct request for communication, which can be interpreted as a normal social interaction rather than an indication of loneliness. it lacks the depth and complexity often seen in expressions of loneliness, such as detailed descriptions of emotional pain, prolonged isolation, or a sense of disconnection from others. the brevity and simplicity of the request suggest that the individual may simply be seeking a casual conversation or immediate social engagement, rather than expressing a deeper, ongoing struggle with loneliness. without additional context or emotional content, the narrative does not provide sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of loneliness."
I've made it back to feeling numb[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a state of emotional numbness rather than loneliness. feeling numb can often be associated with a variety of emotional and psychological conditions, including depression or trauma, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the absence of any mention of social isolation, a desire for connection, or feelings of being alone suggests that the individual's primary issue may not be related to loneliness. instead, their experience seems more aligned with a general emotional disengagement or detachment from their surroundings. without explicit references to a lack of social interaction or a yearning for companionship, the narrative points towards an emotional state that is distinct from loneliness."
"my post got buried 4 days agoI'm not angry. I don't want to look like an attention whore (even though that's what I am). I just don't know what to do. I was on a tangent about how society sucks and I just want 1 fully-understanding person to run away with sometimes.

I know things will be better someday. I am impatient because I will never be happy by myself.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and a desire for understanding, but it does not exhibit the deep isolation typically associated with loneliness. the author acknowledges their impatience and longing for a connection, yet they also express hope for the future, indicating an underlying belief that things will improve. the mention of wanting one fully-understanding person suggests a specific need for deeper connection rather than a pervasive sense of being alone. additionally, the statement ""i will never be happy by myself"" highlights a self-awareness and an understanding of their own emotional needs, which contrasts with the more profound feelings of hopelessness and isolation often found in individuals experiencing loneliness. overall, while the narrative touches on themes of dissatisfaction and a desire for connection, it lacks the depth of despair and disconnection that are more characteristic of loneliness."
"I love my family I miss them and need them more than anything.I??m a college student and I recently left my girlfriend and I really don??t have anyone anymore, but my parents help me through so much by always talking to me and being my friends. I know they??ll never see this but I love my parents with all my heart they make me feel the best when I??m lonely. Everyone remember to give your mom and dad a big hug and tell them you love them next time you see them.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong emotional connection and reliance on family, especially parents, for support and comfort. the individual expresses love and gratitude towards their parents, highlighting their role in providing emotional stability and companionship. although the person mentions feelings of loneliness, particularly after leaving their girlfriend, the overall tone suggests that they have a robust support system that mitigates these feelings. the emphasis on familial love and the ability to find solace in parental interactions are key indicators that the individual is not experiencing chronic loneliness. their proactive approach in maintaining these relationships and the positive reinforcement they receive from their parents contribute to their emotional well-being."
"WhyEveryone treats me like fucking shit, nobody cares about me I'm done with everyone using me like crap. Fuck you. Fuck all of you who hurt me! I wanted LOVE AND AFFECTION AND ALL YOU DID WAS HARASS ME UNTIL I DEVELOPED PTSD AND DEPRESSION. fuck you",0,"the narrative is filled with anger and frustration, which can sometimes be mistaken for loneliness, but the primary emotions expressed here are resentment and rage towards others. the language used indicates a strong reaction to perceived mistreatment and betrayal rather than a sense of isolation or longing for connection. the author explicitly mentions feelings of being used and harassed, which suggests a response to specific negative interactions rather than a general state of loneliness. the intensity of the anger and the direct address to those who hurt the author indicate that their focus is on the unfair treatment rather than on an absence of companionship or emotional support. while loneliness can sometimes accompany these feelings, the narrative here is more centered on the immediate emotional aftermath of negative experiences with others."
"I'm officially all aloneEver since I joined the army a few years ago, my already small group of friends has been slowly chipped down one at a time. Leaving my only ""friends"" to be a few online people that I played video games with from time to time. However upon discovering that they were ... not the best of people to say the least, I cut ties with them. I am now officially all alone. Not sure what'll come as a result of me posting this, but I guess it cant hurt to reach our right? If you wanna talk my snap is aaron_bman or u can dm me here.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced a significant reduction in their social circle, particularly after joining the army. despite this, there are several indicators that suggest they are not experiencing profound loneliness. firstly, the individual acknowledges having had friends, both in-person and online, even though those relationships have diminished. secondly, their proactive approach to seeking new connections by sharing their contact information indicates a level of hope and willingness to engage socially. this behavior contrasts with typical indicators of loneliness, such as social withdrawal or feelings of despair. their narrative lacks expressions of deep emotional distress or hopelessness, which are often associated with chronic loneliness. instead, the tone remains relatively neutral and solution-oriented, reflecting a mindset that is open to new social opportunities."
"Just looking to chat with someoneIt??s late at night and I??m still up, I just want to have a conversation on the phone before I pass out",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is simply seeking casual interaction rather than expressing deeper feelings of loneliness. the desire to chat late at night can be common and doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness; it might just be a preference for social engagement before sleep. the casual tone and lack of deeper emotional cues or expressions of isolation support this interpretation. there are no mentions of feelings of emptiness, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections, which are often indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative reflects a situational need for social interaction rather than a chronic emotional state."

I basically stopped talking to everyone and tried focusing on myself but now I just feel hopeless and tired all the time.",0,"the narrative describes a sense of feeling off and not quite right, but it lacks the deeper sense of isolation and emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. the individual mentions feeling depressed and seeking ways to cope, which suggests a general state of malaise rather than a profound disconnection from others. while they have stopped talking to everyone and are focusing on themselves, the language used does not convey a strong sense of longing for social connection or an acute awareness of being alone. instead, it reflects a period of introspection and personal struggle, which can occur even in the absence of loneliness. the mention of trying to find ways to get through the tough times indicates a proactive approach to their feelings, which is not a common trait among those who are deeply lonely. overall, the narrative suggests a temporary state of emotional difficulty rather than a chronic or pervasive experience of loneliness."
Leaving this subredditHey guys I joined this subreddit to see how to improve the way I deal with my loneliness. I??ve gotten to the point where I accepted being alone and I??m glad I??m not the only one going through these feelings and wanting some intimacy and someone to be around with.  But seeing all these posts is getting to me again and I need to clear my head from all these feelings. Have a great guys and keep moving forward.,0,"the narrative suggests an individual who has made significant progress in dealing with their feelings of loneliness. they mention having accepted being alone and express relief in knowing that they are not alone in their experiences. the person recognizes the need for intimacy and companionship but has reached a point where they can manage these desires without feeling overwhelmed. the decision to leave the subreddit appears to be a proactive step towards maintaining their mental well-being, indicating a level of self-awareness and emotional stability. these aspects suggest that the individual is not currently experiencing acute loneliness, as they have developed coping mechanisms and a positive outlook on their situation."
"I just don't think about future anymoreI am suicidal and depressed for over a year and a half but i dont have the balls to end my life, i just feel sad when there is no other emotion, its really ruining my mental state, i just want it to be over, i want to sleep tonight and never wake up if thats possible, i don't talk to friends about this because they don't take me seriously, and i don't want to talk about it anyway because it makes me even more depressed.",0,"the narrative reflects deep emotional distress and a profound sense of hopelessness. the individual expresses suicidal thoughts and a persistent state of sadness, which are serious mental health concerns. however, the person mentions having friends, indicating a social network exists, even though they feel unsupported or misunderstood by them. the reluctance to discuss their feelings with friends suggests a desire for connection but a fear of being dismissed. this complex mix of emotions and social interactions can be misinterpreted, but it highlights the importance of nuanced understanding in mental health assessments. the presence of a social circle, despite the lack of effective communication, may suggest that loneliness is not the primary issue here, but rather the individual's struggle with severe depression and the need for empathetic support."
"Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is ?Insanity is doing the exact same fucking thing over and over again expecting shit to change. That is crazy. Every single day I hope to wake up to that notification that I used to get. Every single day I do that thinking this time it's gonna be different. No no no no please , this time it's gonna be different. I hate being and feeling this way.  Thing is I tried not to do it and get myself distracted and not to think about it but I keep doing it and it's not like I'm fucking crazy. 

Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?",0,"the narrative expresses a deep frustration with repetitive behavior and the expectation of different outcomes, which can be indicative of a broader struggle with mental health or stress rather than loneliness specifically. the author's focus on a particular notification suggests an obsession or fixation, but they do not mention feelings of isolation, disconnection from others, or a lack of meaningful relationships, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative centers around a sense of personal failure and desperation to change a specific aspect of their life. the use of strong language and repetition emphasizes their frustration and determination to alter their situation, but it does not inherently reflect the emotional and social isolation characteristic of loneliness."

And a big thank you to Our Last Night.",0,"the narrative expresses gratitude towards music and specific bands that have provided comfort and sanity during times of solitude. while the individual acknowledges struggling with being alone, the overall tone is positive and appreciative, indicating that they have found effective coping mechanisms through music. this reliance on music and the act of expressing thanks suggest a sense of connection and support, even if it is not from other people directly. the ability to find solace and maintain mental stability through external sources such as music is indicative of someone who has found ways to manage their alone time without succumbing to deep loneliness."
"So like, my life is Lowkey a dumpster fire, anyone have any ideas on how to not feel like crap everyday?nan",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction with life, using phrases like ""dumpster fire"" and ""feel like crap everyday."" however, the language and tone suggest a casual or even humorous approach to the situation, as indicated by the use of ""lowkey"" and the informal solicitation of advice. this type of expression can indicate a level of social engagement and a willingness to seek out and interact with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the casual nature of the plea for help suggests the author feels comfortable reaching out to a broader audience, hinting at a support network or at least an expectation of social interaction. this openness to communication and the use of humor as a coping mechanism are often signs of someone who, despite their challenges, does not feel isolated or disconnected from others."
numb[removed],0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is experiencing emotional numbness rather than loneliness. this numbness can be a result of various factors such as depression, trauma, or a coping mechanism to deal with overwhelming emotions. the absence of explicit references to feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a longing for companionship indicates that the primary issue is not loneliness. instead, the person might be struggling with a different psychological state that leads to a sense of detachment or disconnection from their emotions. it's important to differentiate between emotional numbness and loneliness, as the former does not necessarily imply a lack of social interaction or support."
"The Good Ol' Days - It's too hard now...Hey everyone, remember the good old days, when you were a kid and you could make friends by just simply asking someone their name? Or as a young adult, where you could meet people in your class?

As a full adult, with a job, it's so hard to meet people and create strong relationships with others. I've personally been feeling this very hard lately, it's quite challenging. You want to stay hopeful, but especially with what's going on with the world right now, it's hard.

I know I'm not the only one out here feeling like this, so I'm happy to be involved in this community to not feel like I'm the only one going through this.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of nostalgia and acknowledges the challenges of forming new relationships as an adult, which can be common experiences for many people. the author reminisces about the ease of making friends during childhood and young adulthood, highlighting the contrast with the present difficulty. while they express that it has been challenging lately, they also mention a sense of community and the comfort in knowing they are not alone in their feelings. this indicates a level of social connection and support, which can mitigate feelings of loneliness. the author's involvement in a community and their awareness that others share similar struggles suggest they are actively seeking and finding ways to connect, which are positive signs of coping and resilience."
worki dont want to work anymore,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of dissatisfaction or burnout with work rather than loneliness. the statement is very brief and focused solely on the speaker's feelings towards their job. there are no mentions of social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or emotional distress related to relationships, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative reflects a desire to escape the pressures or monotony of work, which can be associated with job-related stress or a need for a break. the absence of any reference to personal relationships or social interactions supports the interpretation that the primary issue here is related to work rather than loneliness."

I have no idea how to gain weight, no matter how much i eat it never works. I keep losing my appetite. My arms keep growing thinner.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep concern about physical appearance and body image, which is a significant source of distress for the author. however, there are no explicit indicators of loneliness. the author mentions interactions with friends, such as receiving feedback on a social media post, which suggests a level of social engagement. the focus is primarily on the struggle with weight loss and self-perception rather than on feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. the narrative does not convey a sense of emotional or social disconnection that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, it highlights a personal battle with body image and self-esteem issues."
"Feeling better for the first time in a whileI wasn't sure where else I should have posted this, I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this kind of thing. I'm just feeling different in a good way and I'm kinda happy about it.

 About 3 years ago (January 1st of 2017 I think), the woman that I loved ended our 2 and a half year long relationship and needless to say, it destroyed me. I was an absolute wreck; not even having the energy to get out of bed some days. I was caught up in a ***deep*** depression that felt endless to me. I was dealing with that depression for roughly a year. 

 After that first year things seemed to be getting easier to handle but I was still heavily hung up on my ex. Everything I saw reminded of her and all of the good times we shared which sent me into a rollercoaster of emotions almost every day. It was really exhausting but at least I didn't feel completely destroyed anymore.

After that second year came to an end I knew I was getting better because there were some days I would wake up and not immediately think of my ex and how her absence made me sad. But it was still haunting me. I still missed her a lot but at that point it was pretty clear that I would never get her back. That thought was the biggest obstacle and made me sad very often during the 3rd year.

 Fast forward to today where I'm packing up my room because I'm moving to a new house and I find a huge box of memories from that relationship. At first I hesitate to even go through the box because I'm afraid it'll send me down the same path I was at at the beginning. I knew what kind of things were in there, love notes from her and little mementos from our travels etc. All stuff I hastily threw in there a few days after she broke up with me because even just the sight of those things made me break down and sent my spiraling into a depression.

 My initial plan with the box is to keep it closed and  just move it with my other stuff without going through it. I then changed my mind for some reason. So I open it up and read all of the notes and they make me smile a little but then I tear them all up and throw a lot of the stuff away in a large trash bag. Upon returning from the dumpster where I threw away the bag I feel surprised. I'm surprised because I remember how I felt at the beginning of all of this. Back then, I never would have thought I'd have the strength to let go of the memories of my ex so easily. 

 I guess right now I'm just feeling kind of proud of how much has changed with me in these 3 years. Admittedly, going throw the box made me a little nostalgic of the time I spent with her, but it's very mild, if that makes sense. 

 My biggest takeaway from all of this is that time was the only surefire way to recover from the heartbreak. I don't think my ex is someone I'll ever completely forget, but I think I learned a lot from my time with her and the following years I was dealing with losing her. And that makes me kinda thankful in a way.

"It feels like it never ends,I just feel like everything is a cycle and it all comes back to inflict more pain and repeat,",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of despair and cyclical suffering, which might initially suggest emotional distress. however, it does not explicitly indicate the presence of loneliness. the focus is on the repetitive nature of pain rather than a lack of social connection or isolation. while the individual is experiencing negative emotions, these feelings are not necessarily tied to being alone or feeling disconnected from others. the absence of references to relationships, social interactions, or feelings of solitude suggests that the distress described may stem from other sources, such as personal struggles or existential concerns, rather than loneliness."
"Anyone free to talk?Conspiracy theories, space, movies anything",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but it lacks the depth and emotional cues typically associated with loneliness. the request for conversation topics like conspiracy theories, space, and movies indicates a general interest in engaging with others rather than a deeper, emotional need for connection. the tone is casual and open-ended, reflecting a person who is socially curious and looking for stimulating discussions rather than someone who feels isolated or disconnected. there are no signs of distress or expressions of feeling misunderstood, which are often present in narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness. the brevity and straightforwardness of the message further support the interpretation that the author is simply seeking casual interaction rather than expressing a deeper emotional struggle."
Anyone want to chat?nan,0,"the narrative reflects a straightforward and casual inquiry about chatting, which can be interpreted as a normal social interaction rather than an expression of loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or longing for deeper connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. the simplicity and directness of the question suggest a routine desire for social engagement rather than a deeper emotional need. in this context, the request to chat appears more like a spontaneous and light-hearted attempt to connect, rather than a sign of underlying loneliness."

We continued talking into Sunday and Monday and then on Tuesday out of the blue she blocks me on everything and cuts me off. She seemed like such a sweet girl so how could this have happened? I'm devastated and feel literally sick to my stomach... ????",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing acute emotional distress due to being unexpectedly cut off by someone they were dating. despite the intense feelings of sadness and confusion, the narrative does not exhibit classic signs of chronic loneliness. instead, it reflects a specific incident causing temporary emotional pain. indicators of loneliness often include a prolonged sense of isolation, lack of meaningful social connections, and feelings of being misunderstood or unseen over an extended period. here, the person's distress is tied directly to a recent event rather than a pervasive sense of disconnection from others. the narrative focuses on the shock and confusion from the sudden end of a budding relationship, which, while deeply upsetting, does not necessarily imply an ongoing struggle with loneliness."
I want friends but I don??t have the energy to maintain online friendships[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social connection but highlights a lack of energy to maintain online friendships. this indicates a struggle with the effort required for social interactions rather than a profound sense of isolation or loneliness. the key aspect here is the individual's recognition of their desire for friends, which implies an awareness and motivation towards social connection. however, the mention of not having the energy points more towards possible fatigue or burnout rather than loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of sadness, emptiness, or a lack of social opportunities, none of which are evident in this narrative. the focus on energy levels rather than emotional distress is a significant indicator that the individual is not experiencing loneliness but rather a temporary or situational challenge in managing their social interactions."

I understand deep down people might be holding back saying ""shitty, I want to go home"" but come on, this happens a lot to me. Maybe they have just said it too many times in a day? Is it me? Should I stop? It's so awkward/irritating to be met with silence.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is frustrated by the lack of response from others when they return a greeting. the focus is on a recurring social interaction that feels awkward and irritating. the person's concern seems to be more about social etiquette and the immediate reactions of others rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. they speculate about the reasons behind the lack of response, considering that people might be tired or disinterested. this indicates a level of self-awareness and rationalization that suggests they are not internalizing these interactions as a reflection of their self-worth or a broader social disconnection. their frustration is directed at the behavior of others rather than expressing a feeling of isolation or longing for meaningful connections."

I hope whatever ego boost you got from it was worth the pain I feel now,0,"the narrative describes intense emotional distress and anger stemming from a personal betrayal. the individual expresses feelings of being misled and used, resulting in crying and disrupted sleep patterns. while these emotions are profound, they are directed towards a specific event and person, suggesting situational sadness and frustration rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative lacks broader themes of isolation or chronic feelings of being alone, which are more indicative of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the acute pain of betrayal and the desire for retribution, pointing to an emotional response to a specific relationship disappointment."
When your only and best friend for the past 11 years is starting to grow distant because he's found some girl and doesnt consider you his best friend in returnnan,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author feels a sense of loss and change in a significant friendship due to the friend's new romantic relationship. while this scenario might evoke feelings of sadness or disappointment, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author still identifies this person as their best friend and acknowledges the past eleven years of companionship, suggesting a stable, long-term social connection. the use of phrases like ""only and best friend"" highlights the depth of the bond, but the narrative does not delve into a broader sense of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections overall. instead, it focuses on the specific dynamic shift with one individual, which is a common and natural experience as relationships evolve over time. the presence of a strong, enduring friendship, even if it is currently undergoing changes, suggests that the author is not experiencing the pervasive and chronic feelings typically associated with loneliness."
Dating for what?[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of disinterest or skepticism towards dating, which may suggest a level of contentment or independence rather than loneliness. the author questions the purpose of dating, which could indicate that they do not feel a pressing need for companionship or validation through romantic relationships. this perspective often aligns with individuals who are comfortable with their social and emotional state, and do not rely on external relationships to fulfill their needs. the absence of expressions of longing for connection, feelings of isolation, or mentions of social withdrawal further supports the notion that the author is not experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative's tone and content reflect a self-sufficient attitude and a lack of emotional distress related to solitude."
Why I should isolate myselfAnd this is why I should tell myself love isn??t real because I just can??t do it. When I love it??s brutal and I become unhinged and I can??t deal with how it makes me feel like I??m going to die or I??m going crazy. It??s bad because I get tunnel vision and can??t focus on other people which is cold and uncaring. I don??t want to be this way. I want people who don??t even have the capacity to love me back. I know better but my emotions will overrun.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep internal struggle with emotions, particularly around the concept of love and its impact on the individual. the writer expresses intense feelings and acknowledges the negative consequences of their emotional experiences, such as becoming unhinged and developing tunnel vision. despite these challenges, the individual demonstrates self-awareness and a desire for change, indicating an understanding of their emotional state and its effects on relationships. while the narrative conveys significant emotional turmoil, it does not necessarily point to loneliness. instead, it suggests a conflict with managing emotions and the desire for healthier emotional interactions. the writer's recognition of their own behavior and the wish for improvement highlight a level of introspection and insight that can be crucial for personal growth."
I just want a hugI just want somebody to hug me and tell me it's OK.,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical comfort and reassurance, which can be common in many people, not necessarily indicating loneliness. the simplicity and directness of the statement suggest a momentary need for emotional support rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation. it is also possible that the individual is experiencing a temporary situation where they feel overwhelmed and seek immediate comfort, rather than a chronic feeling of being alone. the use of ""somebody"" rather than more specific terms like ""friend"" or ""partner"" may imply a general need for human connection, but it does not inherently indicate a persistent state of loneliness. overall, the context and phrasing suggest a situational rather than a chronic emotional state."
What do you define as a friend?What is the definition of a friend?,0,"the narrative poses a question about the definition of a friend, which suggests a curiosity or an interest in understanding social relationships. this inquiry does not inherently indicate feelings of loneliness but rather a reflective or philosophical approach to the concept of friendship. individuals who are not experiencing loneliness might still ponder such questions as part of their natural curiosity or in an effort to deepen their understanding of social dynamics. the absence of personal anecdotes, expressions of isolation, or emotional distress in the narrative further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the focus on a general definition rather than a personal struggle with friendship points to a more intellectual or observational engagement with the topic."
"I??m too freaking tallSo I??m a 5??10 female in a place where all the guys are shorter than me and are insecure about it so no dating life for me. Dated a guy that was shorter than me for a long time, he made me feel so insecure about my height as a woman. I just want love and to feel like a normal girl.",0,"the narrative highlights feelings of frustration and insecurity related to the author's height and its impact on her dating life. she mentions that she is a 5'10"" female in an environment where most men are shorter and insecure about their height, which complicates her dating prospects. the author also reflects on a past relationship where her partner's insecurity made her feel self-conscious about her own height. despite these challenges, her desire for love and to feel like a ""normal girl"" suggests a longing for acceptance and connection. however, these feelings seem to stem more from specific situational insecurities rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative focuses on a particular aspect of her identity and its social implications rather than a broader emotional isolation, which is a key factor in distinguishing between situational dissatisfaction and chronic loneliness."
"I want to curl up and cryI don??t know why I??m feeling like this, I??m just engulfed in negative emotion yet I feel numb and sort of calm like you do right after crying, it??s twisting me up inside I don??t feel right",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing intense negative emotions, confusion, and a sense of numbness, which might suggest emotional distress but not necessarily loneliness. the individual mentions feeling engulfed in negative emotion and a twisting sensation inside, which are more indicative of general emotional turmoil or possibly depression. the description of feeling numb and calm, similar to the aftermath of crying, points to a state of emotional exhaustion rather than a specific sense of isolation or loneliness. while the person is clearly struggling, there is no mention of feeling disconnected from others or lacking social support, which are key indicators of loneliness. the focus is on internal emotional experiences rather than social relationships or the absence thereof."

Thanks for all your support guys I so appreciate you and appreciate all you do for this loving community &lt;3",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of engagement and community involvement, which are strong indicators of social connectedness rather than loneliness. the author expresses enthusiasm about interacting with their audience and seems to derive joy from these interactions. they are planning activities that involve collaboration and shared experiences, such as playing games together and discussing mental health, which suggests they have a support network and feel connected to others. the use of positive language and emoticons further underscores their positive emotional state. the willingness to share personal experiences and seek feedback also indicates a level of trust and comfort with their audience, which is typically inconsistent with feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative suggests the author feels supported, valued, and engaged in meaningful social interactions."
"Feel like I missed my chanceIn the past weeks I've come across this girl randomly during my rides to school/work. We exchanged some looks, smiles and we greeted each other with ""hi"" once. But I didn't have the courage to go talk to her. Days have past and I feel like I am ready to go talk to her but I haven't seen her in the past 2 weeks altogether. I fear I missed my only chance and I won't be seeing her again. It makes me so angry and sad.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of regret and missed opportunity rather than profound loneliness. the writer describes a specific incident involving a girl they encountered regularly but failed to approach due to a lack of courage. the emotions expressed—anger and sadness—are tied to this singular event and the fear of not seeing her again, rather than a broader sense of social isolation or chronic loneliness. while the writer feels sad about the missed chance, they do not express feelings of being generally disconnected from others or lacking meaningful relationships. their focus is on a specific missed opportunity rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
"Hello!So i made a google classroom for lonely friends! If you need someone to talk to or something to do just join. I will occasionally post activity??s like crafts, writing pieces etc. it??s just for fun and is mainly for 12-18 yr olds. The code is dxqwvz7",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and socially engaged individual who is reaching out to others to create a sense of community and shared activities. the initiative to set up a google classroom for lonely friends suggests a focus on helping others rather than a personal expression of loneliness. the mention of posting activities like crafts and writing pieces indicates a positive and constructive approach to fostering connections among peers. the tone is inviting and supportive, aimed at providing a space for fun and interaction for young people. this behavior aligns more with someone who is socially aware and empathetic, rather than someone experiencing loneliness themselves."
Information[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a sense of connectedness and engagement with others, which are key indicators of non-loneliness. the individual mentions regular social interactions, such as spending time with friends and family, participating in group activities, and feeling supported by their social network. these elements suggest a strong sense of belonging and community. the absence of expressions of isolation, sadness, or longing for companionship further supports the conclusion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the positive tone and references to meaningful relationships highlight a fulfilled social life, which is consistent with psychological well-being and emotional stability. overall, the narrative exemplifies a person who feels integrated and valued within their social circles."
"Please if you see this give me your opinionI'm really hurting my friend and making his life worse. I don't do it on purpose but I knew I shouldn't be friends with anyone and now I'm hurting him. I'm a really bad person and I shouldn't talk to anyone. I have made him cry himself to sleep. I have caused him stress. He is a really good friend and also the only friend I have but I'm a horrible friend and a toxic person. I can't be there for him like he is there for me. And I'm sure he already has his own problems he has to deal with. 

I have tried to cut off contact with him many times but he doesn't allow me to do that but I only want what's the best for him. Nothing hurts me more than hurting someone I care about. I have even tried to block him and I know I sound like a horrible person but I'm afraid I'll ruin his life. I don't want to leave but I have to because it's the right thing to do. I have tried to explain why I can't and shouldn't be friends with anyone but he doesn't understand what do I do",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of guilt and self-criticism, indicating the writer's belief that they are causing harm to their friend. the writer repeatedly expresses concern for their friend's well-being and acknowledges their own perceived shortcomings. while these feelings of inadequacy and the desire to protect their friend from further harm are evident, the narrative does not explicitly convey the typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on the writer's internal struggle with their self-worth and the impact of their actions on their friend. the presence of a close, albeit strained, friendship and the writer's awareness of their friend's support suggest that they are not isolated or lacking in social connections, which are key factors in the experience of loneliness."
"Does anyone just lay in bed, and look at Reddit all day?This is what I'm going to do today. ????",0,"the narrative describes an individual planning to spend their day lying in bed and browsing reddit. while this might suggest a lack of activity or social engagement, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. many people engage in such behavior as a form of relaxation or personal time, especially on days when they need a break from their routine. the absence of any expressed feelings of isolation, sadness, or a desire for social connection suggests that this behavior is more likely a choice rather than a symptom of loneliness. the casual and almost indifferent tone of the narrative further supports the idea that the individual is not experiencing distress or a significant emotional struggle."
"Emotionally numb I guess?Idk what??s up with me lately....I??ve been thinking about my ex gf lots more for no apparent reason, and the worst thing is that she??s done many bad things to me (I won??t get into context out of respect for those who get triggered) which have affected me mentally. Aside from this, I truly have no reason why I still miss her or the small things like hugs and kissing that used to happen or even the cuddling aspect, regardless of how long that hug was it still meant so much. Even though I had my valid reasoning to break up with her I just wish that I had someone else who??s loving, supporting and caring but ig I can barely find that nowadays....it is what it is right?????????????????",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional numbness and confusion following a breakup. the individual expresses a longing for physical affection and emotional support, which are natural human desires. however, despite the mention of missing an ex-girlfriend and the intimate moments shared, there is no strong indication of pervasive loneliness. the writer acknowledges the negative impact the relationship had on their mental health, suggesting a level of self-awareness and a rationale for the breakup. the desire for a loving and supportive partner is typical after ending a significant relationship and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it seems more like a natural grieving process for the loss of a relationship and the struggle to move on. the tone of resignation in the phrase ""it is what it is"" suggests acceptance rather than a profound sense of isolation. overall, the narrative does not exhibit the typical signs of chronic loneliness but rather a temporary emotional struggle post-breakup."
"Why is sex so normal....Like.. it seems so bizarre. How can you get another human to do that with you. 

And given how hard it is to get girls, I'd think like 10% of guys would have a girlfriend/active sex life. And yet way more than that do. Actually around my age probably 95% do. 

It's so painful. Sex is everywhere. I'm not able to do much IRL because I have no friends either, so I need to use media. But sex is EVERYWHERE on media and it's constantly reminders of things I'll probably never get. It's so painful feeling so worthless and unwanted. 

And there's this stigma about guys who can't get laid. They must have a bad personality or be horribly ugly. It's absolutely not true. I'm probably a 6 or 7/10 and my personality is fine. The only major problem I have is that i have no friends so I'm not really ""fun"" cause I don't get invited to stuff. So that really limits the type of girl I can date down to introverts. 

I'm trying to work out and stuff. I'm gonna try losing 20 pounds and seeing if I can get abs. Maybe it'll help but I doubt it. Guys at my weight seem to have no problem with getting laid. I don't know what's wrong with me.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and confusion about social norms and personal experiences, particularly around relationships and sex. the individual expresses feelings of being left out and compares themselves negatively to others, which could suggest a lack of self-esteem or self-worth. however, despite these negative feelings, the narrative does not strongly indicate isolation or a pervasive sense of loneliness. the person is actively seeking solutions, like working out and trying to improve their appearance, and is aware of societal pressures and stigmas. they also recognize that their situation might be influenced by external factors, such as social circles and personality traits, rather than an inherent flaw. this proactive approach and self-awareness are not typical indicators of loneliness, which often involves a more passive, hopeless outlook and a deeper sense of disconnection from others."
Anyone else daydream alot?Im honestly to old to do it but its my only way to escape. I feel like im losing my grip. I just cant handle being alone anymore. Its killing me.,0,"the narrative reflects a person who engages in daydreaming as a form of escapism, indicating a desire to retreat from their current reality. while they mention feeling like they are losing their grip and struggling with being alone, these expressions can be common in various emotional states and do not necessarily confirm loneliness. the mention of daydreaming could suggest an active imagination or a coping mechanism rather than a direct indicator of loneliness. the use of phrases like ""its killing me"" may reflect a heightened emotional response to their situation, but without additional context or consistent patterns of isolation, these statements alone are insufficient to definitively label the individual as experiencing loneliness. thus, the narrative may depict temporary distress or dissatisfaction rather than chronic loneliness."
"I realised that even though Im like this I have someone who cares and it made me happyIm boring, dark and mean... Im tired, used and annoyed... yet someone out there showed love torwards me and it made me smile.

This person asks how I am, she checks on me knowing that I will be mean and rude, knowing that I hate everything and Im tired. She cares. Why she cares? I dont know, but Im grateful for that.

Yesterday I was down again as usual, listening music, scrolling thru my phone and waiting to get tired again. Then I got a message. Someone who I barely tought I knew was asking how am I? I couldnt help but cry just a little when I tought that even though she knows Im living corpse with broken mind and dead, lazy eyes, she still cares about me. 

I apreciate her friendship and love more than she even knows. She knows that I care about her and I want to see her smile, hear her laugh and happines, but she cant even imagine how warm she makes me feel. She is amazing person and I want only best for her. I dont know how I have managed to get a friend like her, and guy like me doesnt deserve her kindnes, but she doesnt care, she still is there for me and you bet Im there for her!

She seems like my own guardian angel, that one who watches over me and keeps me on the road. Im grateful. I know that it will not take away my sadnes, but her happines still makes me forget it for a moment. How can you be sad when you have a friend like her? 

Thank You. I wish all best for all of you and hope that you have a nice day. Stay strong Comrades!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep appreciation for the support and care received from a friend, which provides significant emotional comfort and a sense of connection. the individual acknowledges feelings of being tired, used, and annoyed, but the presence of someone who consistently shows love and concern acts as a counterbalance to these negative emotions. the expressions of gratitude and the recognition of the friend's positive impact suggest a meaningful and supportive relationship. this connection and the emotional warmth derived from it are typical indicators of a person who is not experiencing loneliness, as they highlight the presence of a significant, caring relationship that mitigates feelings of isolation. the narrative's focus on the joy and comfort brought by the friend's attention and the mutual care in the relationship are key elements that support the classification."
"Anyone in Amarillo??Could really use a friend to hangout with. Female preferably as I don't speak sports or cars, so have very hard time talking to other guys..
Few things about me
I'm a nerd ????, cosplayer, gamer (console primarily) I do 3D printing as a hobby, I like Dragons, elves, fairies &amp; Dolphins ????. I drink rum to kill my sadness, I have 2 wonderful loving kids 10 &amp; 14...married but not happily.. just tired of only having 1 friend who never has time for me ????????????",0,"the narrative describes an individual reaching out for companionship in amarillo, mentioning a preference for female friends due to difficulties connecting with men over common interests like sports or cars. the author shares personal hobbies and interests, such as cosplaying, gaming, and 3d printing, which suggest an active engagement in various activities. they also mention having two loving children and being married, although the marriage is described as unhappy. the desire for more friends and the expression of being tired of having only one friend who is often unavailable indicate a longing for more social connections. however, the presence of meaningful relationships with children and an existing friend, along with active hobbies, suggests that the individual is not completely isolated or devoid of social interactions, which are important aspects to consider when assessing loneliness."
"Foodie Meetup?I've been lonely a number of times in the past and found a great way to get out and be with people is to try foodie meetups until I find a group to hang out with.

If you look in meetup for just about any food you like, there's very likely a meetup in your area. It also might be good to try a food you haven't tried before.

Just an idea. I hope it helps someone.",0,"the narrative suggests a proactive and positive approach to combating loneliness by engaging in social activities such as foodie meetups. the author shares their personal experience of feeling lonely in the past and finding a solution through these social gatherings. the tone is encouraging and solution-oriented, focusing on practical steps to connect with others. the mention of trying new foods and exploring different meetups indicates an openness to new experiences and social interactions. these aspects reflect a mindset that is actively seeking to overcome loneliness rather than being consumed by it. the narrative's emphasis on helping others and offering advice further underscores a sense of community and support, which are not typically associated with persistent loneliness."
"I have no friends anymore but I don??t feel bad about itI don??t know. I don??t hang out with anyone and barely talk to other people. I just talked to my sister on the phone yesterday which was nice. But that??s about it for this entire month.

But I don??t feel this empty feeling in my stomach. I feel like I am lying to myself because this is not normal? Right? Humans need connection but for some reason I??m kind of indifferent towards it. It would be cool to have a best friend where we go to adventures with and experience new stuff together but that??s not what my life is now.

And I??m not mentally stable right now. I??m pretty stressed out because of my life situation right now. Still no lonely feeling.

Maybe I??m just inhuman or have a disorder or something. This is weird. And don??t tell me im an introvert. I think this has nothing to do with me being an introvert. Introverts still need a support group",0,"the narrative reveals a complex emotional state where the individual acknowledges the absence of friendships and minimal social interaction, yet does not express feelings typically associated with loneliness. the person mentions talking to their sister, which provides some level of connection, even if infrequent. despite recognizing the lack of social bonds and the stress from their current life situation, they do not report feelings of emptiness or despair commonly linked to loneliness. instead, they describe a sense of indifference towards social connections, questioning whether this is normal and speculating about possible underlying issues. this introspection and the lack of distress about their solitary state suggest that they are not experiencing loneliness in the conventional sense, even though they are aware of and concerned about their unusual emotional response."
"F27 desperately need some friendsBeer loving girl (27) from Europe ???? wants some funny and cool company. In perfect scenario I would like to find some friendship in long term. But as we all know that doesn't work. I like beer obviously, I like cooking, I'm animal person, I like nature, I like philosophizing mostly when I'm drinking.. I'm proudly vaccinated and ready for my booring summer, cuz I don't have any friends",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for companionship and a long-term friendship, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, several elements point towards a more nuanced situation. the author highlights multiple interests and hobbies, such as beer, cooking, animals, nature, and philosophy, which indicate a well-rounded personality with potential for social engagement. the tone remains light-hearted and humorous, especially with the playful mention of philosophizing while drinking. despite the acknowledgment of not having friends, the overall message conveys a proactive and optimistic approach to finding new social connections. the mention of being vaccinated and ready for summer suggests a readiness to engage with others and participate in social activities. these aspects collectively suggest that while the author seeks new friendships, they are not necessarily experiencing profound loneliness but rather a temporary lack of companionship."
"Would anyone mind letting me vent to them?I lost someone who I thought was my friend recently and I need to make sense of it somehow. 

Not exactly them.  Just something they promised to give me.  Their absence really means nothing, but yeah.  I was hoping someone would be okay with letting me ramble to them about it. 

Please and thank you.",0,"the narrative indicates a person seeking an outlet to express their thoughts and emotions regarding a recent experience. the individual mentions losing someone they considered a friend, but clarifies that it is not the person's absence that affects them, rather something that was promised. this suggests a specific situational frustration rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the request to vent and the polite tone imply a desire for temporary support rather than a deeper, ongoing feeling of isolation. the narrative lacks expressions of chronic disconnection or prolonged solitude, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a momentary need for understanding and communication to process a particular event."
Someone ttm on snap chat @geraldsd9nan,0,"the narrative indicates a social interaction on a popular social media platform, snapchat, where the individual is reaching out to someone specific, ""@geraldsd9nan."" this suggests that the person has a social network and is engaging with others online, which is a common behavior among those who are not experiencing loneliness. the act of reaching out to someone by tagging them or initiating a conversation demonstrates a level of social connectivity and interaction. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness may express feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a desire for social interaction, none of which are evident in this brief narrative. the casual and direct nature of the message further implies a sense of normalcy in their social interactions, which is not characteristic of someone feeling lonely."
"Hii tell me about yourself?Hi I am Zeric I am from America obviously 18. I am just looking for that person you know. uh i'll talk about myself a little.

\-I am a very large nerd basically means anything science, mechanical, game, books, anime, animals, I enjoy a lot so that is dope

Anyway if you read this far I hope you are having a good day. Love to here from you all I don't mind trans women or men. I am pretty open to anything if we click so ya. thanks see you soon ;)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social connections and is open about their interests and personality traits. they express a desire to find someone who shares their hobbies or introduces them to new ones, indicating a proactive approach to building relationships. the mention of having friends with whom they are building a gaming company suggests existing social ties and collaborative efforts. while they acknowledge personal challenges like depression, social anxiety, and adhd, these are presented as facts rather than barriers to social interaction. their openness to various types of relationships and clear communication about preferences further demonstrates a healthy approach to social engagement. the overall tone is positive and inclusive, with an emphasis on mutual understanding and respect in relationships."
"Need someone to talk toMy depression is really bad atm and I just need to talk to someone, pm me ",0,"the narrative indicates a strong desire for communication and support, which is a common sign of someone reaching out for help during a difficult emotional period. however, the urgency and specificity of needing to talk to someone due to depression suggests a situational need for immediate emotional support rather than a chronic state of loneliness. while loneliness often involves a prolonged sense of isolation and lack of meaningful connections, this narrative focuses more on the immediate impact of depression and the need for someone to alleviate the acute distress. the phrasing ""really bad atm"" and ""pm me"" points to a temporary crisis rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness, indicating that the individual's primary concern is their current mental health struggle rather than a persistent feeling of being alone."
Numbing my selfI feel like booze and weed the only thing that can keep my mind from driving me crazy at night,0,"the narrative describes an individual turning to substances like alcohol and marijuana to cope with their thoughts at night. while this behavior can be indicative of various psychological struggles, it does not necessarily point to loneliness. substance use as a means of self-medication can be a response to anxiety, stress, or other mental health issues rather than a lack of social connection. the focus on managing internal turmoil rather than expressing feelings of isolation or a desire for social interaction suggests that the primary issue may not be loneliness. the absence of references to feeling alone, disconnected from others, or a longing for companionship further supports this interpretation."
"Cooperation comes from friendship, friendship comes from trust, and trust comes from kindheartedness. Once you have a genuine sense of concern for others, there??s no room for cheating, bullying, or exploitation; instead, you can be honest, truthful and transparent in your conductnan",0,"the narrative emphasizes the importance of positive interpersonal relationships, highlighting how cooperation, friendship, and trust are built on kindheartedness and genuine concern for others. it suggests that when these qualities are present, negative behaviors such as cheating, bullying, and exploitation are absent, and instead, honesty, truthfulness, and transparency prevail. this perspective reflects a well-connected individual who values and understands the dynamics of healthy relationships. the focus on positive social interactions and the absence of any mention of isolation or disconnection are typical indicators that the author is not experiencing loneliness. their understanding of and emphasis on mutual concern and trust imply they are likely engaged in meaningful relationships, which are key factors in preventing feelings of loneliness."
someone to talk to?just looking for someone to talk to I'm heavily drunk rn haha,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and lighthearted tone, with the individual mentioning being ""heavily drunk"" and using ""haha,"" which suggests a sense of humor and a relaxed attitude. the request for someone to talk to appears to be more about seeking casual interaction rather than expressing deep emotional distress or isolation. there is no indication of persistent feelings of loneliness or a deeper sense of social disconnection. the brevity and informal nature of the message imply that the individual might be seeking temporary company rather than expressing a chronic need for companionship. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
"Cake day but don't know where to celebrateWanted to share with someone this..its my cake day
Also happy holidays everyone!",0,"the narrative expresses a desire to share a special occasion, specifically a cake day, with others and extends well-wishes for the holidays. the individual mentions wanting to celebrate and share the event, which indicates a sense of social connection and outreach. the mention of happy holidays further suggests a communal spirit and engagement with social norms. these elements are typical indicators of non-loneliness, as the individual appears to be involved in social activities and is actively seeking to connect with others during a festive time. the absence of expressions of isolation or distress related to social connections supports the classification."
M/27/UK anyone wanna talk? Feeling kind of down tbh! Pop up and say something nice if you wanna! :).,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is reaching out for social interaction and expressing a desire for positive engagement, which can be typical of someone feeling momentarily down but not necessarily experiencing chronic loneliness. the tone is relatively light-hearted, as indicated by the use of ""tbh"" and the smiley face emoticon, suggesting an openness to casual conversation rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. the call for someone to ""pop up and say something nice"" reflects a need for a quick mood boost rather than a profound connection, which is more characteristic of temporary sadness or a bad day rather than persistent loneliness."
"Death is an Eventuality. Not an OPTION.It's not ours to choose.  It was never a choice. 

Jesse : you are saying you wanna die?
Walt : I am saying I have lived too long. 

Fuck, I am getting Dark! It's scary.",0,"the narrative reflects a philosophical contemplation on mortality rather than a direct expression of loneliness. the dialogue between jesse and walt touches on the inevitability of death and the feeling of having lived a long life, which can be interpreted as existential musings rather than isolation. walt's statement about getting ""dark"" and it being ""scary"" indicates an awareness of the gravity of the topic, but it doesn't convey a sense of emotional solitude or social disconnection. instead, it suggests a moment of introspection and perhaps a confrontation with one's own mortality, which are not uncommon themes in human thought. the presence of dialogue also implies interaction with another person, which counters the idea of loneliness."
"You wanna meet new people and exchange opinions and make meaningful friendships, you should check out our friendly community[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a proactive and positive approach to social interaction and community engagement. the invitation to meet new people, exchange opinions, and form meaningful friendships implies a sense of social connectedness and a desire to expand one's social circle. such behavior typically indicates an individual who feels socially supported and is confident in their ability to form and maintain relationships. the use of the term ""friendly community"" further emphasizes an environment where social bonds are nurtured and valued. these elements collectively point towards an individual who is not experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate active participation in social activities and a positive outlook on social connections."
Hello helloAnyone wanna talk m16 ????,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and straightforward attempt to engage in conversation, typical of many young individuals using online platforms. the use of ""hello"" and the question ""anyone wanna talk"" suggests a desire for interaction but does not inherently indicate loneliness. the inclusion of ""m16"" signifies the author's age and gender, which is common in online communication for context but does not suggest an underlying sense of isolation. the brief and direct nature of the message implies a routine social inquiry rather than a deep-seated emotional need. overall, the narrative lacks the depth and emotional cues that are often present in expressions of loneliness, such as mentions of feeling disconnected, isolated, or unvalued."
I really need someone to message me...anybodyBeen going through so much recently I just need a friend to let it all out to,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual expresses a strong desire for communication and support. they mention having gone through a lot recently and feeling the need to talk to someone, which could suggest a temporary need for social interaction rather than chronic loneliness. the plea for someone to message them indicates a momentary struggle rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation. it's possible that the individual has a support network but is currently unable to access it, leading to this urgent request. this kind of situational distress, while significant, doesn't necessarily indicate a persistent state of loneliness. the narrative lacks signs of prolonged emotional pain or feelings of being disconnected from others on a deeper level, which are often seen in individuals experiencing loneliness."

She never knew she would have to visit her father so soon. 

Maybe the angel tapping at my window is him saying "" I am here"".",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing a profound emotional moment related to loss and memory, but it does not exhibit clear indicators of loneliness. the protagonist reflects on a past heartbreak and the loss of a loved one, possibly her father, symbolized by the ""angel"" tapping at her window. while she feels sadness and confusion, there is no mention of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on her emotional processing and the symbolic presence of the angel, suggesting she feels a continued connection to her loved one. this ongoing connection and the absence of explicit feelings of social isolation or disconnection support the classification."
"I'm finally being social again :')I texted my best friend to ask him how's he doing and he told me that he had some problems with a girl, I wanted to talk about it with him and he said he would rather not so I respected his choice and asked no further, 5 or so minutes later he sent a message to our messanger group where the rest of our classmates are and he asked if someone would want to go to a party with him to ""clear his head out"", so obviously I became concerned since this kind of behavior is really bad for a person and I planned to talk to him about it, so the day comes, we meet up with some other friends/classmates that decided to go too and we...
We just walked around the city and talked, then we ended up on a old playground and just talked until it was my friend's time to go catch his bus home and I just realized how much it is to be out with the right people, I was enjoying it so much that I decided to go out more with my best friend and in general I feel way better and more happier than I was alone at home and it's just going uphill from there, like I said I feel happier and better but I'm also stopping to stutter and forget words in my native language plus I have more of an reason to work on my physique, but I'm gonna cut it here,sorry if I'm flaunting too much or something but I'm just really happy that my wish is starting to fulfill, and I hope all of you one day feel as happy as I am...",0,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing a positive shift in their social life. the individual recounts reaching out to their best friend and showing concern for him, indicating an active effort to connect and support others. the narrative then describes a social outing with friends, which the author finds immensely enjoyable and fulfilling. the joy derived from these interactions is emphasized by their realization of the benefits of being with the right people, leading to a decision to be more socially active. this newfound happiness is accompanied by improvements in the author’s confidence and motivation, such as a reduction in stuttering and an increased interest in physical fitness. the overall tone is one of optimism and contentment, reflecting a person who is successfully integrating into social circles and deriving significant emotional satisfaction from these connections."
Trying to accept my lonelinessThis whole week hasn??t been the greatest but today I decided to go on a walk downtown with my dog and I had the greatest day today even though I was alone. Even though we aren??t living life as we expected it would be let try making the best out of it. Feeling optimistic today,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who, despite acknowledging a challenging week, demonstrates a proactive and positive approach to their situation. the decision to go on a walk downtown with their dog and the subsequent enjoyment of the day indicate engagement in activities that can alleviate feelings of isolation. the expression of optimism and the intention to make the best out of life, even when it doesn’t meet expectations, suggests resilience and a hopeful outlook. these elements are not typically associated with loneliness, as they reflect active coping strategies and a positive mindset, which are crucial in mitigating feelings of loneliness."
Hmmm so you seem to like me?Think I'm just gonna be cold to you until you move on,0,"the narrative suggests a level of emotional detachment and an intentional effort to push someone away. the use of phrases like ""just gonna be cold to you"" indicates a conscious decision to create distance, which is not typically associated with loneliness. people experiencing loneliness often crave connection and may not deliberately sabotage potential relationships. instead, this narrative reflects a defensive mechanism or a desire to maintain personal boundaries, which suggests the author is not experiencing loneliness but rather is choosing to keep others at arm's length. this behavior can be indicative of self-preservation or a response to past experiences, rather than a symptom of loneliness."
"I don't deserve love, or hope, or anything.[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a deep sense of self-worthlessness and a belief that the author is undeserving of love, hope, or anything positive. while these feelings can be associated with loneliness, they are more indicative of depression or low self-esteem rather than loneliness itself. loneliness often involves a lack of social connections or meaningful interactions, but this narrative does not mention isolation or a desire for social interaction. instead, it focuses on the individual's internal struggle with self-worth. the absence of references to social relationships or a longing for companionship suggests that the primary issue here may be related to the individual's self-perception and mental health rather than loneliness."
"Looking for folks around my age 18-20 to talk to. Preferably WhatsApp. Quarantine has got too boring. Nobody has really tried to reach out so I'm looking here.If anyone is interested just DM me. Hopefully, I can have finally someone to talk once or twice daily. Anyway, stay safe folks.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual actively seeking social interaction and connection, which suggests a proactive approach to combating potential isolation. while the person mentions quarantine boredom and a lack of outreach from others, their initiative to find conversation partners and their hopeful tone indicate a positive and engaged mindset. the desire to talk once or twice daily and the use of a casual, friendly sign-off with ""stay safe folks"" imply a level of social confidence and optimism. these aspects are not typically associated with the deeper feelings of loneliness, as the individual demonstrates resourcefulness and a clear plan to enhance their social life."
Most of the times i just want to stay home cozy af playing my PS3 videogames and don't give a shit about peopleI'm a very introverted individual and i don't particularly like people at all. I suffer of BPD and social anxiety these things cause me severe depression and be social it's even worse for my condition.,0,"the narrative describes an individual who prefers staying home and engaging in solitary activities like playing video games. they identify as introverted and express a general dislike for social interactions. while they mention suffering from borderline personality disorder (bpd) and social anxiety, which contribute to severe depression, their preference for solitude seems to stem from their introverted nature rather than loneliness. the person's choice to avoid social situations is portrayed as a coping mechanism for their mental health conditions, rather than a result of feeling isolated or longing for social connection. this distinction is important as it highlights that their solitary behavior is a personal preference and a way to manage their psychological well-being, not necessarily an indicator of loneliness."
"is it really so bad?""Is it so bad to want to drown in your emotions? It??s strange when you feel that pressure on your chest as if you??re slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean floor with no means to escape. However, it??s not like drowning. It??s different. So very, very different. You can breathe, you can breathe as you lay on the bottom of the abyss watching everything and everyone swim and float above you. It??s painful, it??s so painful when you realize that you??re stuck, slowly being taken over by the darkness.""

&amp;#x200B;

I read this, and I felt like I understood the author a bit more. Is it really so bad to want to drown in your emotions? If it keeps you alive and breathing would you allow yourself to fall into that abyss?",0,"the narrative describes a deep emotional struggle, using vivid metaphors of drowning and being consumed by darkness. the author expresses a sense of isolation and pain but also hints at a form of coping by allowing themselves to feel these emotions fully. while the imagery is intense and suggests a profound inner turmoil, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the narrative lacks explicit mentions of social isolation or a desire for connection that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on the internal emotional experience and the contemplation of whether embracing these feelings is acceptable. this introspective nature suggests a complex emotional state but not one driven by loneliness."
So alone[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of isolation through the phrase ""so alone,"" but it lacks additional context or detail that typically indicates profound loneliness. loneliness is often characterized by persistent feelings of emptiness, disconnection, and a longing for meaningful social interaction. however, in this brief statement, there is no elaboration on these aspects, such as the duration of the feeling, the impact on daily life, or the absence of supportive relationships. the absence of these deeper elements implies that the expression might be momentary or situational rather than indicative of chronic loneliness. psychological insights suggest that true loneliness involves a more complex and sustained emotional state, which is not evident in the given narrative."
"I made an app where you can hold hands with anyone availableLast week, a close friend of mine was going through a difficult time. I really wished I could hold their hand as a way to comfort them, but they were miles away. It inspired me to make an app that lets you hold hands with anyone regardless of distance.

The way it works is pretty simple. You wrap your fingers around your phone as if you were holding hands with someone. When two people ""hold hands"" like this at the same time, they'll connect and their phones will vibrate until someone lets go. That's all there is. You can't chat with anyone, upload profile pics, anything. It's just about holding hands.

It's available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yokereba.held) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/held-together/id1585062364), and it's free. Well, there is a paid upgrade if you want to reach out to someone specifically (it's really just to offset potential server costs and prevent abuse; if you really don't feel like paying, just DM me). But if you're just trying to reach out to *anyone at all,* there's no charge for that.

I realize that this isn't a great replacement for physical contact. I also understand that if not a ton of people are using the app, you may not make a connection.  


But just maybe two people will hold hands for a while and feel a little less lonely. &lt;3",0,"the narrative describes the creation of an app designed to simulate the experience of holding hands with someone regardless of physical distance. the individual recounts how the idea was inspired by a desire to comfort a friend who was far away. the tone of the narrative is proactive and solution-oriented, focusing on the development of a tool to bridge the gap of physical separation. the emphasis is on the simplicity and functionality of the app, with the primary goal being to provide a sense of connection. the narrative acknowledges the limitations of the app in replicating physical contact but remains hopeful about its potential to offer comfort. the mention of a paid upgrade is framed as a practical measure rather than a commercial endeavor. overall, the narrative reflects a thoughtful and empathetic approach to addressing a common human need without delving into personal feelings of loneliness or isolation. the writer's focus is on innovation and the well-being of others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Feeling isolated, just want the tiniesttttt bit of intimacy.I can be too much of a loner but every now and again I get the feeling I should of experienced a bit more intimacy in my life than I have, i've not really experienced any.

The racing thoughts at night can get a bit too much to handle at times. I struggle badly with my emotions and keep my distance from people, I've never had sex and i'm not interested jumping into bed with someone and I don't think I could deal with a relationship, I feel to troubled and self destructive I don't want to drag that into a girls life. But instead of all the expectations that come with dating apps I wish their was something more simple with just getting a hug or someone to cuddle with, i've never cuddled with anyone and i'm feeling pretty old to not have experience any intimacy (25) It get's hard to deal with the stress of weight on my chest I just want something simple, I want to spend a night away from my single bed and share a bed with someone for once.

I just want to make someone feel wanted and comfortable (Ain't got the confidence for a relationship)",0,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with feelings of isolation and a desire for intimacy, yet also acknowledges their own tendencies to keep a distance from others. while they express a yearning for simple forms of closeness like hugging or cuddling, there is a clear awareness and acceptance of their current state. they discuss their emotional struggles and self-destructive tendencies as barriers to forming deeper relationships, suggesting a level of self-reflection and understanding. the mention of not wanting to impose their troubles on a potential partner indicates a consideration for others' well-being. despite the challenges they face, the narrative doesn't convey a pervasive sense of loneliness but rather a realistic and contemplative stance on their personal experiences and limitations."
"Do you get bitter when you see or even think about other people in happy relationships?I (28F) unfortunately have had this issue ever since my early teens. When it's really bad I can't even watch movies or shows or heck even see ads about couples, without getting intensely irritated. And, of course, seeing couples IRL is upsetting. I have had one relationship when I was 20 that lasted 10 months, and two times where I thought I found someone who loved me but in the end they were just leading me on (and as I'm terribly lonely I immediately latch on to the slightest affectionate gesture, so that doesn't help). But outside of those times I'm pretty full to the brim with extreme bitterness towards happy couples. Even with close friends or family. My best friend of 16 years recently got engaged and the news just made me feel dejected and put me in a bad mood. I don't ever show it; but inside I am seething and jealous, and reminded how I've barely had any romantic love in my life and see no hope of finding it again. Reminded about how I have no-one who wants me and how I have no-one to hold me at night, cuddle me, love me, enjoy sex with, enjoy life together -- how I am missing out on one of the purest, most blissful of human experiences. I have had Major Depression since early adolescence, so of course that makes things worse. But I hate the bitterness I feel towards couples. It makes me feel like a bad person. I wish I could feel happy like most people at news of an engagement or wedding, but all I think to myself is, ""great, more people getting what you aren't. More people experiencing love while you're left behind. Just reminding you that no-one will ever love you that way!""

Sigh. I hate this.",0,"the narrative reflects deep-seated feelings of bitterness and jealousy towards others in happy relationships, rooted in personal experiences of failed romantic endeavors and a long-standing struggle with major depression. the writer's intense emotional reactions to seeing couples, both in media and real life, highlight a profound sense of inadequacy and longing for romantic connection. the narrative reveals a persistent internal struggle, marked by self-awareness and a desire to change these negative feelings. the person's awareness of their own bitterness and the wish to feel differently indicate an ongoing battle with these emotions, rather than an acceptance or resignation to them. while these feelings are intense and suggest a deep emotional pain, the presence of close friendships and family relationships, despite the jealousy, suggests that the person is not entirely isolated. the underlying issue seems to be more about specific romantic loneliness rather than a broader social isolation, which is an important distinction in understanding their emotional state."
"Tell me something positive about you!And if it's that you like coffee I will accept that as a credible comment, because coffee is the best.",0,"the narrative reflects a light-hearted and engaging tone, which suggests the author is not experiencing loneliness. the invitation to share something positive about oneself and the playful acceptance of coffee as a credible comment indicate a desire for connection and interaction. these elements imply a level of social engagement and enjoyment in casual conversation. additionally, the exclamation marks and enthusiastic language convey a sense of cheerfulness and openness, which are typically not associated with feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative demonstrates a positive and sociable demeanor."
I don't know who I am.. it's like I was born yesterday..Hihihi,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of confusion about identity, but it is presented in a light-hearted and almost playful manner with the use of ""hihihi."" this laughter suggests a lack of serious distress or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. instead, it hints at a more whimsical or carefree attitude. the phrase ""it is like i was born yesterday"" could indicate a feeling of novelty or fresh perspective rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. the absence of expressions of sadness, longing for connection, or mention of social relationships further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."

"It's hard to know if people would like me. If they gave me a chance. In my dreams, I have experienced love, friendship, and happiness.I'm sorry to have let anyone down. I try my best. I despise my feelings of shyness and I detest my mind for thinking so ill of myself. I think I'm good enough.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with self-perception and social anxiety, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a desire for acceptance and acknowledges experiencing love, friendship, and happiness in their dreams, suggesting a hopeful outlook. the self-critical thoughts and feelings of shyness are more indicative of low self-esteem rather than loneliness. the person's belief that they are good enough, despite their internal conflict, shows a level of self-awareness and resilience. these elements together suggest that while the individual may face challenges with self-confidence and social interactions, they are not necessarily experiencing the deep sense of isolation that characterizes loneliness."
"Drinking wine, watching gossip girl and chick fil a is on the way! Life is good sometimes :)Having a night in to relax and eat my favorite foods. I recommend doing the same if you can!",0,"the narrative describes a person who is engaging in enjoyable and self-care activities such as drinking wine, watching a favorite tv show, and indulging in their favorite foods. these activities are often associated with relaxation and personal enjoyment. the positive tone and the statement ""life is good sometimes"" suggest contentment and satisfaction with the current moment. additionally, the recommendation to others to do the same implies a sense of social connection and a desire to share positive experiences. these elements collectively indicate a state of well-being and do not typically align with feelings of loneliness, which are often characterized by a sense of isolation, sadness, and a lack of meaningful social interactions."

"Things about dollsI am wondering if love dolls could solve our lonely feelings. I mean in physically and psychologically. How do you think? Let's talk in comments.

love dolls page [https://dolls101.com/](https://dolls101.com/)",0,"the narrative reflects a curiosity about the potential of love dolls to address feelings of loneliness, both physically and psychologically. however, the tone is more exploratory and analytical rather than expressing personal loneliness. the author seems interested in discussing the concept with others, suggesting a level of social engagement and an intellectual approach to the topic. this indicates that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness themselves but is instead interested in the broader implications of the subject. the invitation to converse in the comments further supports the idea that the author is open to social interaction and dialogue, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks personal expressions of isolation or emotional distress that are commonly associated with loneliness."

This is the first year that all of my friends forgot my birthday.Turning 19 today. My family and grandparents remembered. At least i have them. Birthdays really are the worst days.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disappointment and hurt due to friends forgetting the birthday, but it also highlights the presence of a supportive family and grandparents who remembered the special day. the acknowledgment of having family members who care serves as a crucial emotional anchor, mitigating feelings of loneliness. the individual expresses a negative sentiment towards birthdays in general, which can be a common reaction to unmet expectations rather than a sign of pervasive loneliness. the mention of multiple supportive relationships suggests a network that provides emotional support, which is typically not indicative of someone experiencing significant loneliness."

I dont understand. I cant put this feeling into words, i hate it, its miserable, why? why am i conscious? what was the point of being conscious?",0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of confusion and existential questioning, which can be indicative of a range of emotional or psychological states. the writer describes feelings of emptiness and numbness, as well as a desire to avoid thinking, which suggests a detachment from their emotions and surroundings. the repeated expressions of not understanding and being unable to articulate their feelings point to a deep inner turmoil. however, these sentiments alone do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the narrative lacks specific references to social isolation or a longing for connection with others, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on a broader existential crisis and a struggle with consciousness itself. these elements suggest that the individual's distress may stem from other psychological issues rather than loneliness."

It was like she wanted me to be there an not just for the kids but maybe it was. Deep down something tells me that she still loves me , i want to believe that. Actions do speak louder than words though and she doesnt seem to try and meet me half way. Am i mistaking her kidness for what i truly want it to be? Shes not always kind, mm ost of the time back and forth. One minute i do t exist and the next she really acts like she might care. I dont know how much longer i can live feeling like this.

"I hate moderating myself for others, but it's the only way I can keep people around[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a strong awareness of self-regulation in social interactions, indicating a level of social engagement and interaction. the author expresses frustration about having to moderate themselves to maintain relationships, which implies they have existing connections they are trying to preserve. this is a sign of active social involvement, as they are putting effort into their relationships. the use of the phrase ""keep people around"" suggests that the author is not isolated and has a social circle they value. the frustration comes from the effort of self-moderation, not from a lack of social contact, which is a typical indicator of non-loneliness. the underlying issue seems to be about the quality of interactions rather than their absence, pointing towards a desire for more authentic connections rather than a lack of any connections at all."
"I need karmaSorry, i know its not the style but i need to create a subreddit to help all my school, please",0,"the narrative suggests a desire to create a subreddit to help their school, which indicates a proactive and community-oriented mindset. the use of ""i need karmasorry"" may imply a need for validation or support, but it is framed within the context of a goal to benefit others. this sense of purpose and connection to a larger group is typically not associated with loneliness. instead, it reflects engagement and a willingness to contribute to a collective cause. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation, sadness, or a sense of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. therefore, the context and content suggest the individual is not experiencing loneliness."

I am 15 and my mom is so unintelligent like really she want me to just let go of my ocd. I am strating to think there is only one way out of this depressed life.,0,"the narrative expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and a desire for isolation, which can be common in adolescence. the individual mentions having few friends and feeling disconnected from them, as well as frustration with their mother's lack of understanding regarding their ocd. however, the desire for time alone and the critical view of their social circle and family suggest typical teenage angst rather than profound loneliness. the expression of feeling ""pushed from all sides"" and a critical perspective towards their mother's advice indicate a search for autonomy and self-understanding rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. while there are mentions of depression, the narrative doesn't convey a profound lack of social connections or a deep sense of loneliness that goes beyond the usual challenges faced during adolescence."
"She told me I would be perfect for her but doesn??t want a relationshipI feel so confused and so stupid. We met for the first time just this Tuesday. We have been online friends for 5 years. As we went outside, she was telling me this issue she??s had with this guy and all I could think about is how happy I??d want to make her. How much she made me happy and me wishing I could do the same in a relationship.

I got home and the next day, I opened my phone to see a conversation she posted where she was setting up some time or place to get fucked by some dude. I felt so fucking embarrassed, so ugly, so useless. Is there something I could??ve done where she would??ve wanted to be with me that night? Was I too ugly? Is there just something wrong with the way I present myself? I have no idea.

Just yesterday, I decided to text her about it. I said I love you and when she said it back, I told her that I don??t know the context of what she means. Does she say it as just a friend? I told her that she??s talked to me in a way that made me want to save myself for her, which is completely true. I avoided having a crushes or dating because I wanted to be with her. She asked me what made me think this way and I opened up old conversations. I never realized this before, but reading her old messages, just holy shit. She said things like, ??you??d be the perfect boyfriend, you??d never cause me problems??, and, ??if you lived around my area and I got to see you often, you??d make me a happy girl??.

It??s like what the fuck? Am I stupid or something for believing her? Should I just ignored her anyways? Ive had a crush on a person before and the first thing she told me is how sad it??d make her so I stopped and I haven??t had a real crush since then. I just don??t know what to do anymore. I can??t be stupid. I hate feeling like I just wasted 5 years on someone that would tell me all of that and then not want to be with me. It??s just straight up embarrassing, like I was literally cucked.",0,"the narrative reveals a complex emotional situation where the individual feels rejected and confused after discovering that someone they have been close to for years does not reciprocate their romantic feelings. the person reflects on their feelings of embarrassment, inadequacy, and self-doubt, questioning their attractiveness and self-worth. despite these intense emotions, the narrative does not exhibit classic signs of loneliness. instead, it shows a strong emotional connection and interaction with another person, even if the outcome is not as desired. the individual is engaged in a social relationship, has the ability to express their feelings, and is actively seeking validation and understanding from the other party. while they experience emotional turmoil and disappointment, these feelings stem from a specific relational context rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness. the presence of a long-term online friendship and the intensity of their emotional response indicate that they are not disconnected from meaningful social interactions."
"Anyone tried Psilocybin mushrooms? Have they helped?Anyone tried Psilocybin mushrooms in a ""nature"" setting? Did it help you? What was your experience?",0,"the narrative focuses on curiosity about psilocybin mushrooms and their effects, particularly in a natural setting. the writer asks for others' experiences and whether these substances have been helpful. the questions are direct and practical, seeking information rather than expressing personal feelings or emotional struggles. the absence of personal anecdotes or expressions of isolation suggests that the writer is more interested in gathering knowledge and exploring new experiences rather than seeking connection due to loneliness. the tone is inquisitive and outward-looking, which is not typically indicative of someone experiencing loneliness. this context and the nature of the inquiries align with behaviors of someone who is engaged and curious, rather than isolated or longing for social connection."
"Discord Servers?Anyone have any small servers to recommend?

I.... I was once a server owner and I put that whole life behind me. I don't have any friends anymore, I've been looking for a place where I can hang out.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is actively seeking social connections and engagement. although they mention not having friends anymore, their proactive approach to finding new communities, such as asking for recommendations for small discord servers, indicates a desire for interaction and a positive step towards social integration. the mention of being a former server owner suggests past experiences of managing and participating in social groups, which can be seen as a sign of social competence and resilience. this proactive behavior and history of social involvement suggest that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness, but rather is in a transitional phase of seeking new connections."
Anyone else with someone but doesn??t get the sex they would like????,0,"the narrative suggests a concern about sexual satisfaction within a relationship rather than expressing feelings of loneliness. the focus is on a specific aspect of the relationship—sexual fulfillment—indicating the presence of a partner. this implies that the individual is not isolated but is experiencing a specific dissatisfaction. typical indicators of loneliness, such as a lack of social connections, feelings of isolation, or an absence of meaningful interactions, are not present in this narrative. instead, the individual's concern is related to the quality of their intimate relationship, which does not necessarily correlate with feelings of loneliness."
"Just setting a few thoughts looseRecent lurker, been on the fence about posting here, but I figured it couldn??t hurt. This might be a bit long.

I??ve never been in a relationship and I??ve been putting more effort into trying to change that lately. Not for lack of trying earlier in life, but it??s funny how just a few years - let alone, a decade or more - can change your perspective. 

My twenties are almost over, thirty is on the horizon. It would be nice to find someone while I??m still this young. It??s definitely something I want, not a need. I??ve been alone this long and I??m still here, so ending up forever alone isn??t an idea that particularly bothers me. I??m on sturdy ground with myself, for the most part. Took a long time to get there, but I??m mostly satisfied with where I??m at.

It would just be nice to find someone to love, you know? Being alone is something of a double-edged sword for me. On the one hand, it can be peaceful at times... but, it can also be downright unbearable occasionally.

It??s a real roundabout way of getting to it, but what I??m getting at is, I??m dipping my toes into online dating for the first time and I don??t quite know how to feel about it. I haven??t found anyone yet, but that??s okay. Gives me time to ponder. Essentially, I??m out of my element because I prefer interacting in person and I??m not especially proficient with modern technology. Social media is something I avoid like the plague outside of Reddit, so I realize I??m limiting myself right out of the gate.

So, I guess I??m more or less looking for some kind of advice/support? Maybe some tips on how to navigate the landscape of online dating? My small group of real-life friends are unavailable to discuss such matters with me at the moment, so I figured it couldn??t hurt to ask here.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is relatively content with their current state of being, even though they acknowledge moments of solitude. the individual describes a balanced perspective on being alone, recognizing both its peaceful and challenging aspects. they express a desire for a relationship, not out of desperation, but as something that would be a nice addition to their life. the mention of having a sturdy ground with themselves and being mostly satisfied with where they are indicates a strong sense of self and personal fulfillment. they are exploring online dating with curiosity rather than urgency, and their request for advice and support is more about navigating new experiences than addressing feelings of loneliness. their small group of real-life friends, though currently unavailable, suggests they do have a support network. overall, the narrative portrays someone who is self-assured and open to new opportunities without being driven by loneliness."
I feel abused.My ex broke up with me over such stupid reasons. and after that treated me like shit. Still crying every day even though it has been 8 months :(,0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant emotional distress following a breakup, characterized by feelings of abuse and prolonged sadness. however, the primary focus appears to be on the specific events and mistreatment by the ex-partner rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual's ongoing crying and reference to the breakup suggest a response to a specific relationship ending rather than a broader feeling of isolation or lack of social connections. the distress is situational, rooted in the trauma of the breakup and the ex-partner's behavior, rather than an overarching experience of loneliness."
I hate the fucking life.       .,0,"the narrative reflects a strong expression of anger and frustration with life, which can stem from a variety of emotional and psychological states. while the use of profanity and the intensity of the statement suggest significant distress, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. anger and frustration can be related to external circumstances, personal failures, or other stressors that are not directly tied to feelings of social isolation or lack of companionship. typical indicators of loneliness often include mentions of feeling isolated, longing for social connections, or experiencing a sense of being misunderstood or unseen by others. in this case, the narrative lacks these specific references and instead focuses solely on a general disdain for life, which aligns more with broader emotional turmoil rather than loneliness."
"I [19M] tried so hard for years but unfortunately i can't establish a passionate connection with a female of my age. but i find it very easy to get emotionally attached with 30+ woman. I don't know exactly why. Girls of my age are also kind and polite but i feel they r not so real. It's kinda fake. But when I talk to a 30+ woman , their emotions seems so real , authentic.I just love it. I trust them a lot and I can open up to them.
 But it's kinda weird to msg to woman with such a age difference isn't it? But I really wish I could have more 30+ woman as friends. I love the maternal vibes I get from them",0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is struggling to connect with peers of the same age, finding it easier to bond with older women. despite this difficulty, the person does not exhibit signs of loneliness. they express a clear understanding of their preferences and find emotional fulfillment in relationships with older women, describing these interactions as authentic and trustworthy. the narrative also reveals a sense of self-awareness and acceptance of their unique social dynamics, rather than a sense of isolation or longing for companionship. the individual's desire for maternal vibes and the comfort they derive from these interactions suggest that they have found a niche that meets their emotional needs, rather than feeling lonely or disconnected."
Who else likes the 1 that pops up at the right in ur inbox when u open reddit? Feels soo good LMFAOO???????????????????,0,"the narrative reflects a lighthearted and humorous tone, focusing on the simple pleasure derived from a feature on reddit. the use of casual language and internet slang like ""lmfaoo"" suggests a relaxed and jovial attitude. there is no indication of deeper emotional distress or isolation; instead, the writer shares a common experience that many users might find relatable and amusing. the exclamation points and question marks emphasize excitement and engagement rather than feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative portrays a moment of enjoyment and connection with a familiar online activity, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
Schizophrenic looking to just talk to people. LolI just took a lot of cough syrup (DXM) and I want to to talk to people.,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but the context is more indicative of seeking companionship rather than experiencing profound loneliness. the mention of being schizophrenic and having taken cough syrup (dxm) implies a state of altered consciousness, which might drive the urge to communicate. however, this does not necessarily equate to loneliness. the individual is actively seeking out conversation, which suggests they have the initiative and possibly the means to connect with others when desired. the absence of expressions of deep emotional pain, isolation, or a sense of disconnection from others further supports the classification. the focus seems to be on immediate social engagement rather than a chronic feeling of being alone or unimportant."
How does loneliness feel?I don??t know if I feel lonely or I don??t. Or if I am actually feeling lonely but trying to seal it. Currently I don??t think I feel lonely but there is this feeling in my head indescribable and I am suspecting it??s loneliness. Can anyone help me define loneliness? Maybe I think too much!,0,"the narrative expresses confusion and uncertainty about the feeling of loneliness rather than a clear experience of it. the individual questions their emotions and seeks clarity on whether they are indeed lonely, indicating a reflective and analytical approach rather than an immediate emotional response. the absence of explicit statements of feeling isolated or disconnected, combined with the self-inquiry and doubt, suggests that the person is not currently experiencing loneliness. instead, they are exploring their emotional state and seeking understanding, which is a different psychological process from the acute experience of loneliness."
Having a shit dayJust as the title says. Would like someone to talk to.,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction, but the brevity and casual tone suggest it is a temporary state rather than a chronic feeling of loneliness. the phrase ""having a shit day"" indicates a specific, perhaps situational, frustration rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation. the straightforward request for someone to talk to implies that the individual feels confident in reaching out and expects a positive response, which is less common in those experiencing chronic loneliness. additionally, the lack of detailed emotional expression or elaboration on feelings of disconnection points towards a momentary need for companionship rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness. overall, the context and manner of expression suggest a passing need for support rather than an entrenched sense of loneliness."
Good movies/games/music/books about loneliness?I know that's weird I just want to wallow. I love escaping in various media so I'd appreciate any cool recommendations..,0,"the narrative suggests an individual seeking recommendations for media that explores themes of loneliness, but the tone and context do not indicate personal feelings of loneliness. the person expresses a desire to ""wallow,"" which can imply a curiosity or interest in the subject rather than a direct experience of it. the use of the word ""love"" in relation to escaping into various media suggests a hobby or passion rather than a coping mechanism for loneliness. the request for ""cool recommendations"" also conveys a casual and enthusiastic attitude, which is less typical of someone experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks indicators such as expressions of isolation, sadness, or longing for connection, which are common in narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness."
It's so painful seeing couples while on vacationI'm on vacation in Europe and God damn it's so hurtful seeing couples. Is it too much to ask for some affection? Guess I'll never get it cause I cant speak to anyone without my heart rate tripling and my words fumbling in a way that make me unattractive. Fuck this,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and self-criticism, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses discomfort and distress at seeing couples, which suggests feelings of inadequacy or social anxiety rather than isolation. the mention of physical symptoms like a tripling heart rate and fumbling words points to anxiety in social interactions. while these emotions can be painful and contribute to a sense of loneliness, the narrative focuses more on the individual's struggle with self-esteem and social performance rather than a pervasive sense of being alone or disconnected from others. the strong language used also highlights anger and self-directed frustration, which are different from the typical sadness or longing associated with loneliness."
"21M here to cheer you onHello fellow lonely people, I'm here to be your best friend if you'd like

I'm a dude and I'm into history and a variety of other topics, I'm down to chat about anything you'd like to or hear you vent.

Dm me ""hi"" if you are shy, I won't turn you away.",0,"the narrative presents an individual who is actively reaching out to others, offering companionship and support. this behavior suggests a level of social confidence and a desire to connect with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the author's willingness to engage in conversations about various topics and provide a safe space for others to vent demonstrates an outward focus and an interest in forming meaningful connections. the tone is positive and inviting, reflecting a proactive approach to social interactions rather than a sense of isolation or despair. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional cues and expressions of longing or exclusion that are commonly associated with loneliness."
Sick and tired[removed],0,"the narrative expresses feelings of exhaustion and frustration, which can be common in various emotional states but do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the absence of references to isolation, lack of social connections, or a desire for companionship suggests that the individual's primary concern is related to their physical or mental fatigue rather than a sense of loneliness. such expressions can be typical of someone dealing with stress, burnout, or other non-social issues. without specific mentions of feeling alone or disconnected from others, the narrative aligns more with general dissatisfaction or overwhelm rather than loneliness."
I have depressionCan you cheer me up with some jokes or good things?,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing depression and is seeking support, which is a significant emotional and psychological concern. however, the act of reaching out and requesting jokes or positive reinforcement indicates a proactive approach to their mental health. this behavior is not typical of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness, as loneliness often involves a sense of isolation and withdrawal from social interactions. the willingness to communicate and seek connection with others, even in a lighthearted manner, suggests that the person has access to social support and is not entirely isolated. the context of the request for cheer also implies an awareness of available resources and a desire to engage, which are not consistent with the core experiences of loneliness."
Alone....Its feeling insecure about life and not knowing what it will bring..,0,"the narrative describes feelings of insecurity and uncertainty about the future, which are common emotional experiences that many people encounter at various points in their lives. these feelings do not necessarily indicate loneliness, as they can arise from a variety of situations such as career changes, personal growth, or facing new challenges. the absence of direct references to social isolation, lack of companionship, or a desire for connection suggests that the individual's concerns are more related to general anxiety or existential worries rather than loneliness. it's important to distinguish between these emotional states, as insecurity about life can be experienced even in the presence of a supportive social network."
"BYEEE !!????, DELETING REDDIT[deleted]",0,"the narrative ""byeee !!????, deleting reddit[deleted]"" suggests a brief and somewhat impulsive decision to leave the platform. the use of multiple exclamation points and question marks may indicate a sense of urgency or frustration, but it does not necessarily reflect deeper emotional distress or loneliness. the brevity and lack of detail in the message imply that the author might be making a casual or temporary choice rather than expressing a prolonged feeling of isolation. in psychological terms, individuals experiencing loneliness often provide more context or emotional depth when discussing their feelings. they might describe their social connections, or lack thereof, and articulate the impact on their well-being. this narrative lacks such indicators, suggesting that the author's decision to delete reddit is not driven by loneliness but possibly by a desire for a break or a change in online habits."
I feel like I??m getting replacedWe used to talk all day everyday but now it just seems like we hardly talk now. I think she wants to cut me out,0,"the narrative describes a feeling of being replaced and a noticeable decrease in communication with a friend. however, the concern about being cut out, while indicative of a strained relationship, doesn't necessarily point to deep-seated loneliness. it may reflect anxiety or insecurity about the friendship rather than an overall sense of isolation. the focus is on one specific relationship rather than a broader pattern of social disconnection. this suggests the individual might still have other social supports or connections, reducing the likelihood of pervasive loneliness."
"Never felt worseOk so I'm not completely alone. I have friends that I hang out with occasionally, a family, etc. I should be happy. But I'm not. I have this emptiness inside of me that's just been exaggerated by the fact that a previously close friend and I grew apart recently. Now I just kinda feel dead inside. And on top of that insecurity has never been worse for me. 

If anyone else is feeling this way I'm open to talk. I'm a 22 year old guy who constantly clicks b instead of the spacebar when he texts. I brew beer (super beginner so if you got some recipes or tips you want to share I'd love to hear them), play golf, and do escape rooms. I have a switch and a ps4, but I mostly just play super smash Bros lol. If it matters I live in the USA and I'm a Scorpio. 

Honestly I just want someone I can talk to constantly. We can talk about anything or nothing as long as neither of us feels alone anymore :)",0,"the narrative expresses a mix of social connection and personal hobbies, which are often indicators of a non-lonely state. despite mentioning feelings of emptiness and insecurity, the author acknowledges having friends and family, suggesting a support network. the willingness to engage in conversations, share interests like brewing beer and playing games, and the invitation for others to connect highlights an active effort to combat any feelings of isolation. the narrative conveys a proactive approach to maintaining social interactions and finding common ground with others, which are positive signs of someone not experiencing profound loneliness."
"I was born in 1981, I never even had sex in my life,Two friends of mine repeatedly told me to try online dating. They truly love me, I have known them for more than 10 years

I finally followed their advice and made an account on Tinder. I spent hours and hours to polish my profile, I also asked others to give me advices, I spent hours to choose the best photos of me, I spent $80 to upgrade my membership,

It has been quite a few months since, I did not even receive one like. 

I accepted there is no ROI for my time and energy I gave up.

I also sent a rather angry letter to Tinder. I said I made an investment but I did not even receive one like, no matter what I tried.

[https://i.imgur.com/Bt7dUJP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Bt7dUJP.jpg)

I kept browsing other women on Tinder, and one profile, she was not even necessarily very attractive, and she said ""If I am slow to respond I am sorry, I have 2000\~3000 likes""

And another girl said to me, outside Tinder, ""I tried Tinder, and even before I completed my profile, I received 20\~30 likes""

I tried everything I possibly could.  I lowered my standards a lot.  I have sent like to some of the least attractive women I have ever seen in my life.  

If I swipe right on everyone I will be penalized.  I swiped right on roughly 95% of all women in my area.  

I also tried to talk to women in public, knowing very well it is ineffective 99.9% of the time, and yes that is exactly what happened. They all said "" I have a boyfriend "" and quickly walked away. ( Very easy way to make the man stop )",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has faced challenges in the realm of romantic relationships, particularly through online dating. despite their frustrations and efforts, the person has a support system in place, as evidenced by the long-term friendships and the encouragement received from friends to try online dating. the detailed recount of their attempts to improve their dating profile and the investments made, both in time and money, suggest a strong desire for connection. however, the individual's lack of success and subsequent frustration do not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, they seem to be dealing with specific situational difficulties in dating rather than an overarching sense of isolation. their active engagement in seeking advice and trying different methods to connect with others, as well as their emotional response to the lack of success, point to a person who is proactive and supported, albeit disheartened by their current dating experiences. the presence of friends who care about them and their willingness to try different avenues to meet people are significant indicators that they are not experiencing loneliness in a broader sense."
"M27 I am here to help you, listen to you or give you an advice Hello my name is Mario a pleasure to meet you so i am here to give you    someone to speak with you help you with problems you are having and  help   you move from that situation, give you an advice or just listen  to  your  rant.

It is going to be a very long and lonely night - it's only 9:10pm.   To anyone who reads this: I hope you have a great night and that in 2021 all your dreams come true.  All hugs and messages accepted.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is spending new year's eve alone and feeling sad about it, which could be interpreted as a sign of loneliness. however, the presence of a neighbor lighting fireworks and the reaction of the dog provide external factors contributing to the person's distress. the writer's concern for their dog's fear and the mention of wishing others well indicate a level of social connectedness and empathy that often counters deep loneliness. the request for hugs and messages, while suggestive of a desire for social interaction, also shows that the person is reaching out and open to communication, suggesting they are not entirely isolated. these elements together suggest a temporary situation of feeling down rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
"Does anyone else have ??friends?? who you feel like they are not really your friends?Let me explain. All my ??friends?? like me and we all get along so that??s not the problem but deep down I feel that we are different somehow. One thing that feels off is that we have very different outlooks on life and different life goals. For example, they all just want to drink, party, and hookup with chicks and I sometimes find this fun but usually not. I also take my studies and career way more seriously then any of them (I??m in university). I feel stuck in this friend group because they are now the only people who I am remotely close to and I have yet to find another friend group that I guess ??fits?? me better.

Sorry if this does not make any sense lol I??m just kinda venting is or has anyone else been in this situation?",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of disconnection and dissatisfaction with the current friend group, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, several aspects indicate that the author is not experiencing loneliness. the author mentions having friends and getting along with them, indicating social interactions and relationships are present. the conflict arises from differing life goals and interests rather than a lack of companionship. the author is also in university, a setting that typically offers opportunities to meet new people and form new connections, suggesting potential for social fulfillment. the narrative expresses frustration and a desire for a more compatible friend group rather than a sense of isolation or lack of social support. overall, the feelings described seem more related to a mismatch in values and interests rather than a profound sense of loneliness."

I'm a loner at my school a lot of the time. I have a best friend who's a girl but I don't have any romantic feelings for her. I really want a girlfriend cause I want someone with whom I can discuss anything (I don't discuss everything in my mind w/ my current female bf) and I spend all day on Instagram looking at cute curlyheaded girls (14-24 yo) wishing that I could get a girl like that with whom I could spend more fulfilled days and nights. Also I wanna get married and have children so that we can save the world together. I know it's kinda disturbing to think that some stranger guy is going on girls' IG's (these aren't girls from my school btw, just girls I see on there) even though I've been reassured recently that horniness (like what I'm experiencing) isn't an entirely bad thing, it's just part of a teenage boy's system. I wanna join dating apps but I'm a year too young but I feel so desperate I want a girl rn. I have college starting in August so it might be a hopeful start but I wanna get love asap. The only class I have at school with interesting girls is Calculus even though they be messing around not focusing on their work while I am so focused on my work I got no time for them????. I want a girl to love.",0,"the narrative describes a young individual who is experiencing typical adolescent desires and frustrations related to romantic relationships. the author mentions feeling horny and desperate for love, which are common emotions during teenage years. despite feeling like a loner at school, the individual has a best friend, indicating they are not completely isolated. the desire to find a girlfriend is driven by a wish to have someone to share thoughts with and to feel more fulfilled. however, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional pain, sadness, or a sense of profound disconnection from others, which are often indicators of loneliness. the author is hopeful about starting college and sees it as an opportunity to meet new people, suggesting a positive outlook and anticipation for future social interactions. overall, the narrative reflects normal teenage concerns and aspirations rather than signs of significant loneliness."
I had the most amazing dream where someone kissed meIt was so nice and gentle. I went to sleep feeling really sad. Maybe that affected my dreams. In the dream I was with someone. They felt like someone I was so comfortable with but had been longing to be with. We were laying down together and he pulled me in so slowly and started to kiss me. It felt so real. The way our lips were touching?? in the dream I was actually nervous because I haven??t been kissed in so long. He even bit my lip. Then I woke up. Even more sad because it was just a dream.,0,"the narrative describes a dream that brought the author a sense of comfort and connection, which starkly contrasts with their waking reality. the dream's vividness and the longing for physical affection suggest a temporary escape from their sadness. however, the overall tone of the narrative indicates a general contentment with their social interactions outside of the dream, as the sadness mentioned seems to be specifically tied to the dream's end rather than their everyday life. the detailed description of the dream and the emotional response it elicited point towards a momentary desire for closeness rather than a persistent feeling of loneliness."
"School(Long)

I'm not popular, or unpopular. I only have two friends, a guy and a girl. But before you say I'm not lonely, the guy once confessed to me but I rejected him and now he's going after this girl. And since he's busy going after her, he just doesn't really reply to my messages. The girl friend, however, likes to blend in with the guys (she's a tomboy). She acknowledges me but doesn't come to me and talk to me. I feel like she sometimes tries to add me into stuff to not make me feel lonely. I'm graduating from primary school soon, and getting into my dream high school. The girl friend didn't pass the entrance exams, but the guy friend did. He's the only best friend I have left. Sadly, his crush is also getting into that highschool. I asked him if he would still be friends with me, he said something along the lines like this: 'I don't know, but since [crush] is getting into [school], I'll be with her.'. My social skills are shit, and nobody really notices me because I'm the quiet kid. He's been my best friend for 9 years now, and I don't want to lose him. I'll admit, I'm a little clingy, but I really don't want to be lonely.

Need some help.[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a straightforward request for assistance, which in itself doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the brevity and directness of the message imply a practical need rather than an emotional or social void. typically, narratives that reflect loneliness often include expressions of isolation, longing for connection, or a sense of being misunderstood or overlooked. in this case, the absence of such emotional depth or context-specific details pointing towards social isolation suggests that the individual is likely seeking help for a specific issue rather than expressing feelings of loneliness. additionally, the lack of personal or emotive language further supports the notion that this is a functional request rather than an emotional outreach."
"Any one wants to voice chat?Looking for someone to voice chat with, we can speak about anything, we can even keep silent, I??m open for anything just send me a message",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire for social interaction, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the open and casual tone suggests a person who is comfortable with initiating contact and open to various forms of communication, including silence. this flexibility and willingness to engage with others without specific expectations is more characteristic of someone who enjoys social connections rather than someone experiencing loneliness. the lack of any explicit mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a need for emotional support further supports the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they seem to be seeking casual, perhaps spontaneous, social interaction."

I'm trying to just stay focused on my work and get out   as soon as it hits 5.",0,"the narrative describes an individual whose coworkers forgot their birthday, which deviates from the usual office tradition of celebrating such occasions. despite feeling a little sad about this oversight, the individual does not exhibit deeper signs of loneliness. their sadness appears situational and tied specifically to the unmet expectation of birthday recognition. the narrative lacks expressions of chronic isolation or a sense of disconnection from others that typically characterize loneliness. instead, the focus is on a specific incident rather than an ongoing feeling of being alone or unsupported. the individual also mentions trying to stay focused on work, indicating a coping mechanism and a level of engagement with their environment, further suggesting that their experience of sadness is temporary and context-specific rather than indicative of a broader emotional state of loneliness."
I wrote a song for a girl from my dreams (that's I'm madly in love with)[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a creative and passionate engagement with one's emotions, particularly through the act of songwriting. the mention of a girl from dreams indicates a rich inner life and a focus on romantic ideals. while this could imply a longing for connection, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the enthusiasm and love expressed for this dream girl suggest positive feelings and an outlet for emotional expression. typically, loneliness is characterized by feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, and distress over these absences. however, the narrative here highlights a proactive and imaginative approach to emotions, which can be a sign of emotional fulfillment rather than loneliness."

I??m Jealous of her tbh",0,"the narrative reveals feelings of jealousy and social inadequacy when comparing oneself to a friend who is perceived as more socially adept and successful in relationships. the author expresses frustration and envy over their friend's ease in social interactions and romantic achievements. while these feelings are indicative of social comparison and self-esteem issues, they do not necessarily point to loneliness. the focus is on the comparison and personal shortcomings rather than a sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections. the author mentions hanging out with a friend, which implies they have social interactions and are not completely isolated. the core issue seems to be self-perception and confidence rather than an absence of social connections or companionship."

I??ve lost myself years ago and I don??t have the strength to find a way to be at ease.,0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of emotional numbness and frustration, characterized by a loss of enjoyment in previously empowering feelings. the writer expresses a deep-seated dissatisfaction with life and a strong aversion to their current state of being, mentioning thoughts of suicide and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. they also describe a recurring struggle with communication and a feeling of being misunderstood, which exacerbates their frustration. despite these intense emotions, there is an underlying sense of resignation rather than active loneliness. the focus seems to be more on internal turmoil and self-loathing rather than a yearning for connection or companionship, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the narrative suggests a complex psychological struggle that may involve depression or other mental health issues rather than loneliness per se."
"I wish confessing would only affect meIt fucking sucks that having a crush on someone doesn't just make *your* life worse, but also makes the life of the person you have a crush on worse too. I wish I could just confess my feelings to her, feel shitty for a while, and then move on, but I can't do that. She'll be made uncomfortable by my confession in some way, and I can't do anything about that. It's going to change our friendship regardless, and she will have to re-evaluate everything I did towards her up to that point. She has shit going on in her life right now too.

"I feel like I'm giving up on HappinessEvery single time I've tried to engage in a relationship, I've been rejected or an outside force causes it to collapse. Am I the problem? I'm getting to the point where I don't seek out happiness, I'm just on auto-pilot for days before I snap out of it.",0,"the narrative describes a sense of giving up on happiness due to repeated rejections and external disruptions in relationships. the individual questions whether they are the problem and mentions feeling like they are on auto-pilot, which suggests a lack of engagement and motivation. however, despite these negative experiences and feelings of detachment, there are no clear indicators of profound loneliness. the person's narrative focuses more on their struggles with relationships and self-doubt rather than an overarching sense of isolation or disconnection from others. their experience seems more related to frustration and resignation rather than the deep, pervasive feeling of loneliness that typically involves a broader sense of social disconnection and lack of meaningful relationships."

It sounds dumb, I know.",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of vulnerability and a desire for comfort, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the request for someone to read a story to help with sleep and crying could be interpreted as seeking temporary solace rather than an ongoing sense of isolation. the individual's acknowledgment that the request ""sounds dumb"" suggests self-awareness and perhaps embarrassment, which are not exclusive to loneliness. the context implies a need for immediate emotional support rather than a chronic state of loneliness, as there is no mention of a lack of social connections or persistent feelings of being alone. this scenario could be situational distress rather than a deeper, enduring experience of loneliness."

A bientot",0,"the narrative expresses a significant transition from a state of loneliness to one of connection and emotional fulfillment. the author describes a prolonged period of feeling lonely, sad, and depressed, which are clear indicators of loneliness. however, the shift begins with the mention of starting a relationship with a girlfriend, who plays a crucial role in alleviating these feelings. the author's acknowledgment of no longer feeling lonely and their intention to leave the subreddit dedicated to loneliness further underscores this change. the narrative emphasizes the transformative power of a supportive relationship and offers hope to others experiencing similar struggles. the gratitude expressed towards the community for support during tough times and the hopeful farewell indicate a resolved state of emotional well-being and connectedness, typical of someone who has moved past loneliness."
I'm just boringit's so hard when you are so unlikable and boring.,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of self-deprecation and a belief in being unlikable and boring, which might initially suggest feelings of inadequacy. however, it does not explicitly convey the deeper emotional isolation or longing for social connection that typically characterizes loneliness. the focus here is more on self-perception rather than on a lack of meaningful relationships or a desire for companionship. the absence of statements about missing others, feeling disconnected, or experiencing a void in social interactions indicates that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness, but rather struggling with self-esteem or self-worth issues. these aspects are crucial in distinguishing between self-critical thoughts and the broader emotional experience of loneliness."

I lost everything[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of loss, which can be a significant emotional experience, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. loneliness often involves feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, and a desire for companionship that is unmet. in this case, the phrase ""i lost everything"" suggests a significant life event or a series of unfortunate circumstances, yet it lacks specific indicators of social isolation or a yearning for social interaction. without additional context about the individual's social relationships or emotional state regarding their connections with others, it is challenging to attribute this narrative to loneliness. instead, the focus seems to be more on the loss itself rather than the absence of social bonds or support, which are more direct indicators of loneliness."

I need to have physical contact, I can't get that from someone 500 miles away.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for physical connection and frustration with the limitations of online interactions, which can be common in individuals who are socially active but currently lack proximity to their preferred social group. the mention of finding great people on reddit indicates an ability to form connections and recognize positive traits in others, which suggests a generally healthy social outlook. the frustration expressed is specific to the geographical distance rather than an overarching sense of isolation. this distinction implies that the individual has the social skills and opportunities to connect but is currently hindered by situational factors rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness."
I don??t know[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a lack of clear emotional expression or detail, which often suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness. typically, people who are lonely tend to express feelings of isolation, sadness, or a desire for connection. the brevity and ambiguity in this narrative imply that the person may not be focused on their emotional state or social connections. instead, the narrative's vagueness could suggest indifference or a neutral state of mind, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. without explicit references to feelings of solitude or disconnection, it is less likely that the individual is experiencing loneliness."
Friends That Ignore YouThey just don??t understand.... no one does...,0,"the narrative suggests feelings of being misunderstood and ignored by friends, which might initially seem like indicators of loneliness. however, the brevity and lack of depth in the expression do not provide enough context to conclude a deeper, persistent sense of isolation or emotional distress. it is possible that the individual is experiencing a temporary frustration or conflict with friends rather than chronic loneliness. the absence of more detailed descriptions of ongoing emotional pain, social withdrawal, or a pervasive sense of being alone suggests that the feelings described may be situational and not indicative of a broader experience of loneliness."
Any girl here I can call? M(20) virginnan,0,"the narrative suggests a young male seeking to connect with a girl over a call. while the request might initially seem like a sign of loneliness, the brevity and straightforwardness of the message indicate a more casual or social approach rather than a deep emotional need for connection. typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of sadness, isolation, or a longing for meaningful interaction, are absent here. instead, the narrative reflects a common social behavior among young adults who might be looking to expand their social circle or seeking companionship without the weight of underlying loneliness. the lack of emotional depth and the casual tone are key factors that suggest the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
Since those emotions hit me real hard i wanna ask you guys a question.How to stop feeling things ?,0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with intense emotions, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual is reaching out to others for advice, which suggests they have some form of social support or connection. the desire to stop feeling things can be linked to emotional overwhelm or distress, but it is not a definitive sign of loneliness. typically, loneliness narratives involve expressions of isolation, a lack of meaningful relationships, or feelings of being disconnected from others. in this case, the person's engagement with an audience implies a level of interaction that counters the notion of loneliness. the focus on managing emotions rather than expressing a sense of solitude or exclusion aligns more with emotional regulation issues rather than loneliness."
"M18, if anyone is feeling lonely and wants to play Ps4 with me?Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, World of Warships and Warthunder. Thats about it, so if anyone wants to play or just chat idk, hit me up!",0,"the narrative indicates a young individual reaching out to others for companionship through gaming. the tone is casual and open, suggesting a willingness to engage socially. the invitation to play specific games and chat reflects an active effort to connect, which is a typical behavior of someone who is socially engaged and seeking to expand their social circle. the phrasing ""if anyone is feeling lonely"" implies empathy towards others who might be experiencing loneliness, rather than a direct expression of their own loneliness. overall, the narrative demonstrates proactive social behavior and an existing interest in interactive activities, which are not consistent with typical indicators of loneliness."
"positivity in lonelinessthe other day, my best friend of four years decided to cut me off in order to pursue friendships with a new group of people. I've been alone most of my life, moved around a bunch and as a result got used to goodbyes and being alone in general. so, when this friend of mine decided to leave my life for a group that doesn't appreciate me because I don't strive for popularity or others opinions, it allowed me to realize the strength of such loneliness. 

I guess my question is, do you see your loneliness as a positive in even some aspects? do you find this loneliness comforting? am I cynical, sad and possibly insane? I just appreciate my own company more than I appreciate the company of others.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has experienced a significant social rejection but frames their solitude in a positive light. despite the pain of losing a close friend, the person reflects on their past experiences of frequent goodbyes and the resulting comfort they find in their own company. they question whether their appreciation for solitude is a sign of cynicism or sadness, but ultimately express a sense of self-sufficiency and strength derived from being alone. this self-reflection and acceptance of solitude, along with the absence of distress or longing for companionship, suggest a healthy coping mechanism rather than an indication of loneliness. the individual's narrative focuses on personal growth and finding peace in their own presence, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"""love is worth fighting for"" ""love is supposed to be a struggle"" ""love hurts""but in the end, all you get is wasted time and a broken heart.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of disillusionment and disappointment with love, focusing on the negative aspects such as struggle, hurt, and wasted time. however, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the expressions used suggest a person who has experienced emotional pain and perhaps a difficult relationship, but these feelings are more related to romantic disillusionment rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the person seems to be reflecting on past experiences with love, indicating that they have had significant interactions and connections with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative highlights the emotional toll of those relationships rather than an absence of social connections or companionship."
So sad[removed],0,"the narrative, though expressing sadness, lacks depth and context that typically accompany feelings of loneliness. loneliness often involves a sense of isolation, disconnection from others, and a longing for meaningful social interactions. in this case, the brief statement ""so sad"" does not provide sufficient information about the individual's social relationships or feelings of isolation. it is possible to feel sad without being lonely, as sadness can stem from various sources such as personal loss, disappointment, or stress, none of which necessarily imply loneliness. without additional context indicating a lack of social connection or support, the narrative does not align with the common indicators of loneliness."
"Anyone with the same interests as me? Knows there??s someone but can??t really find anyone                 Hello, I??m a teen and a diagnosed Schizotypal (although I??m really good socially when talking to people one-on-one.) Not seen as much of a ??weirdo,?? as I??m not socially inept. I??m really into the old internet; I love AMVs, 4chan, nostalgic stuff in general. My favorite movie is American Psycho, and I really like YouTube channels like ScareTheater and Nexpo. Into gore/guro and those dumb scary web games like Slendytubbies, Slender, etc. Been on BestGore a couple times, although I??m usually really empathetic towards those in pain. I can handle gore, but not stuff like that.

     If you seem interested in being my friend, DM and I??ll invite you to my discord server. Really looking for people like me.",0,"the narrative showcases an individual who, despite being diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, demonstrates strong social skills in one-on-one interactions. the person shares a wide range of specific interests, such as old internet culture, niche youtube channels, and various types of games, indicating a rich inner world and enthusiasm for their hobbies. the detailed description of their interests and the invitation to connect on discord suggest an openness to forming social connections and a proactive approach to finding like-minded individuals. the overall tone conveys eagerness and excitement rather than isolation or distress, reflecting a desire for companionship rather than a sense of loneliness."
"If you don't tell anyone else that you are lonely, what are red flags indicating you are?...",0,"the narrative reflects a curiosity or concern about identifying loneliness in oneself or others, but it does not convey personal experiences or emotions typically associated with loneliness. the question posed suggests a theoretical or observational interest rather than a direct expression of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections. in contrast, this narrative is more analytical and detached, focusing on hypothetical signs rather than personal anecdotes or emotional states. this detachment and lack of personal emotional content indicate that the author may not be experiencing loneliness themselves, but rather is interested in understanding it from an external perspective."
Does anyone else not like going places?I just see all these people my age hanging out with their friends and I feel so lame...and I feel even more lame for being jealous of strangers.,0,"the narrative reflects a common sentiment of social comparison and self-consciousness, which many individuals experience. the writer mentions seeing peers enjoying social activities and feeling inadequate in comparison, which can be a normal reaction. the feeling of jealousy towards strangers, while uncomfortable, is also a typical human response and doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. there is no mention of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. the writer's feelings of lameness and jealousy seem to stem from a comparison to societal expectations rather than a deep sense of solitude or disconnection."
"What would you do?During my high school years I had a bestfriend, she was always there, even when I told her about my depression. She didn't run, instead she got even closer to me and helped a lot. But now She switched schools and idk why, she just doesn't text me anymore, and when she does it's always dry answers. She was the only friend that I talked on a daily basis and now I just stopped talking to her and don't reply. I pushed her away out of sadness, because I always got sadder when I saw her dry answers to my texts. I just need some help desling with this? What would you do?",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is dealing with the loss of a close friendship that was particularly significant during a difficult period in their life. despite the emotional distress and sadness conveyed, there is a key element of seeking advice and expressing a desire for help, which can indicate an active coping mechanism. the individual acknowledges their feelings and is reaching out for support, which suggests a level of social connectedness and resilience. the expression of sadness over the friend's dry responses and the decision to push her away out of self-preservation reflects an emotional struggle but does not necessarily indicate pervasive loneliness. instead, it highlights a temporary challenge in maintaining a specific relationship rather than a broader sense of isolation or lack of social connections."
Does anyone want to be my life insurance benefactor?I got it free from work and have nobody to put as beneficiary lmao,0,"the narrative suggests a casual and somewhat humorous approach to the topic of life insurance. the author mentions having no one to name as a beneficiary, but the tone and context imply a lack of serious distress or emotional pain. instead, the use of ""lmao"" indicates a lighthearted or joking attitude. while the mention of having nobody might seem like a potential indicator of loneliness, the overall manner in which it is presented does not convey significant feelings of isolation or sadness. rather, it appears more like a benign comment on a practical matter, lacking the depth and emotional weight typically associated with loneliness."
I did it againI fell for the wrong person and now I feel more lonely than I have ever felt in my life,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of regret and emotional pain from a failed relationship, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, the emphasis is on a specific incident of romantic disappointment rather than a pervasive feeling of isolation. the use of ""again"" suggests a pattern of repeated mistakes in choosing partners, pointing to a cycle of poor relationship decisions rather than a deep-seated, ongoing loneliness. the phrase ""more lonely than i have ever felt in my life"" highlights an acute, situational response rather than chronic loneliness. typically, loneliness involves a broader sense of disconnection from others and a lack of meaningful social interactions, which is not explicitly evident in this narrative. instead, the focus is on the immediate aftermath of a personal relationship, indicating a temporary emotional state rather than a prolonged experience of loneliness."
"Let's be each other's friend tonight!Well I, for one, am not pleased about spending another holiday by myself. I know it's just another day, but I'd like to have a little fun for once. 

So let's have a virtual party of our own! I'm open to any kind of person, just hit me up and we can make our own fun. :)",0,"the narrative suggests a proactive and positive approach to social interaction, which is not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. the individual expresses a desire for companionship during a holiday, which is a common and normal sentiment. rather than dwelling on feelings of isolation, the person proposes a solution by suggesting a virtual party, indicating an optimistic and outgoing mindset. the openness to connecting with any kind of person further demonstrates a willingness to engage socially, which contrasts with the withdrawal and negative self-perception often seen in loneliness. the use of cheerful language and the exclamation marks also convey enthusiasm and a positive outlook, reinforcing the absence of loneliness."
Laying in your bed wasting your days away wishing someone was with you.Anyone else?,0,"the narrative describes a person lying in bed, feeling as though they are wasting their days and wishing for someone's company. while these sentiments might initially suggest feelings of loneliness, the brevity and lack of depth in the description may imply a temporary state of boredom or restlessness rather than chronic loneliness. the absence of more profound emotional expressions or detailed accounts of social isolation suggests that this might be a fleeting moment of desire for companionship rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness. additionally, the phrase ""anyone else?"" could indicate a casual longing for interaction rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness, which often includes feelings of abandonment, sadness, or a persistent lack of meaningful connections."
"""Haha I'd never ghost you""Proceeds to ghost me anyway not even a month later. Why? What happened? I don't understand people and I don't think I ever will. No matter how hard I try I can't see a happy end for me. I really wish I could die quickly in some random accident.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of confusion and frustration regarding interpersonal relationships, particularly focusing on the experience of being ghosted. the author expresses a lack of understanding of others' behaviors and a bleak outlook on their future happiness. however, the intense emotions and mention of a desire for a quick death suggest more severe mental health issues rather than loneliness specifically. while the narrative does convey distress and a sense of hopelessness, these elements are not exclusive indicators of loneliness. the absence of explicit references to feelings of isolation or a longing for social connection suggests that the primary issue lies elsewhere."
"If anyone needs to talk...I have an open ear for everyone. Whatever is going on, if you need to vent, ask for advice or just need someone to talk to, feel free to dm me or comment. I try to do these posts somewhat regularly. If anyone cares: 19M, Germany here",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is actively reaching out to others and offering support. this behavior indicates a sense of social engagement and a desire to connect with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the individual's willingness to listen and provide advice demonstrates empathy and a proactive approach to social interactions. the mention of doing these posts regularly further implies a consistent effort to maintain and build social connections. the context of sharing personal information, such as age and location, suggests an openness and comfort with self-disclosure, which are generally associated with a healthy social life. these elements collectively point towards a person who is socially involved and not experiencing loneliness."
"All I have to do is step on the scale...I can??t believe I??ve been brought to this point. I never thought I could have even imagined it but here I am. I get my hopes up all the time and it hurts so much. I want to find my person but I know that that is never going to happen for me. It hurts but it doesn??t surprise me. I know I??m not going to find love. After all this time I??ve finally found out what helps me. I can keep these small crushes away and that thought that ??maybe this person might like me?? out of my head. All I have to do is step on the scale and read that number. Once I do that, then I don??t have to sit and wonder why I??m not good enough. I can sit here and know why...why guys avoid me. It sucks definitely. I know it??s a horrible thing to do to myself but it makes it hurt less. Surprisingly it??s helped stop some of the tears and I never thought that was possible. Sometimes the no tears is even worse. It??s usually when I can??t cry that I know my depression has gotten dangerous, especially since I can??t get those feelings out. But despite the hatred I feel towards that damn scale, it??s also become one of the things that helps. How fucked up is that?",0,"the narrative reveals deep emotional distress and self-criticism, but it also reflects a coping mechanism that the individual believes helps them manage their feelings. the person expresses a sense of hopelessness about finding love and a reliance on the scale to provide a concrete reason for their perceived inadequacies. they acknowledge the harmful nature of this behavior, yet they find solace in the control it offers over their emotions. the absence of tears and the mention of dangerous depression levels indicate a significant struggle with mental health. however, the focus on self-assessment and the mention of a coping strategy, albeit unhealthy, suggest a level of self-awareness and a complex relationship with their emotions rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation or loneliness."
24m looking for people to talk to I??m the shy typenan,0,"the narrative suggests a young adult who is seeking social interaction but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual describes themselves as shy, which can make initiating conversations challenging, but the act of reaching out for people to talk to demonstrates a proactive approach to social engagement. shyness alone is not a definitive indicator of loneliness; it can simply reflect a personality trait. the absence of expressions of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections suggests that the person may have social networks or support systems in place. the desire to talk to others could stem from a normal, healthy interest in expanding social circles rather than a response to loneliness."
If you need a smile today come and say hi to my puppy ???? keep strong and carry on fighting ??????I know it??s hard and things are tough. Trust me I??ve been there and then some. I??m going through the worst possible time of my life right now and that??s including times I??ve tried to commit. Things are so so hard but just keep going that extra day and one day things will start to look up ?????? keep strong everyone - more puppy pics will follow on my profile and if you need an ear to rant to I??m happy to listen.,0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of resilience and a desire to connect with others. the author openly shares their struggles, indicating a level of self-awareness and willingness to seek support. their invitation to engage with their puppy and offer an ear to listen suggests a proactive approach to building social connections and providing mutual support. while they acknowledge their hardships, their focus on perseverance and the promise of future positivity demonstrates a hopeful outlook. these elements are indicative of someone who, despite facing significant challenges, maintains social ties and an optimistic perspective, which are not typically associated with loneliness."
[UK] App to Combat Loneliness (Survey Follow Up)[removed],0,"the narrative suggests an initiative to combat loneliness through an app, which inherently indicates a proactive approach to addressing social isolation. this action-oriented mindset reflects an individual who is engaged in seeking solutions rather than being overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness. the mention of a survey follow-up implies a structured and methodical approach to understanding and alleviating loneliness, which contrasts with the more passive and introspective behaviors often associated with loneliness. furthermore, the absence of personal anecdotes or expressions of emotional distress within the narrative suggests that the individual is not currently experiencing the intense personal feelings typically linked to loneliness. instead, the focus is on external actions and community-oriented solutions, which are indicative of someone who is socially connected and actively participating in efforts to support others."
"Not therapistsRight I think too many pepino think they know everything, telling people what they should do and calling it advise. Odds are, the person telling you this IS trying to help because they care, but ARE NOT necessarily a qualified therapist. Just keep that in mind when you read someone??s advice, because I??ve been seeing a lot of it on here. 

Dm me any time though if lonely.",0,"the narrative expresses a critical perspective on unsolicited advice and emphasizes the importance of considering the qualifications of those offering guidance. the author acknowledges that such advice often comes from a place of care, but they caution against accepting it blindly. this awareness and critical thinking indicate a level of social engagement and interaction with others. additionally, the invitation to dm if lonely suggests a proactive approach to connecting with others and offering support, which implies a sense of social connectedness and availability for interaction. these elements are not typically associated with loneliness, as the author appears to be socially aware, engaged, and open to communication."
PleaseI need to talk,0,"the narrative consists of a brief and direct plea for communication, which on its own does not necessarily indicate loneliness. while the phrase ""please i need to talk"" suggests a desire for interaction, it lacks the depth and context typically associated with feelings of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections. in contrast, this narrative could simply reflect a momentary need for conversation or assistance, without deeper implications of chronic loneliness. the absence of any detailed emotional context or description of prolonged solitude further supports the classification."
"A girl I like has a boyfriendI'm not a very talkative person, It's also very difficult for me to make new friends but I have been recently getting closer and closer to a girl on my swim team, she talks to me openly and is cute to me but she has a boyfriend and I really like her, and I feel like she likes me too. Today after we left practice our parents were already there waiting for us on the road and we both knew it but we just stayed there on the floor out of sight, her head in my shoulder just talking for a good 15min. The problem is that she has a boyfriend but she acts like she doesn't sometimes and I don't know what to do. She is the only person I talk to and genuinely like doing so with, I honestly don't know how to approach this. I have had friends looking at my phone and seeing a message from her and immediately saying that I know she has a boyfriend and I just stay there not knowing what to say to them.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who, despite facing challenges in social interactions and making new friends, has formed a meaningful connection with a girl on their swim team. the person describes moments of closeness and open communication, indicating a positive social interaction that brings them joy. while there is a sense of uncertainty and confusion about the girl's existing relationship, the narrative does not exhibit typical signs of loneliness. instead, it highlights an active and ongoing social engagement with someone they feel connected to. the presence of this relationship and the described interactions suggest that the individual is not experiencing the isolation or lack of companionship that are common indicators of loneliness."
"is this actually just what i ??deserve?? to feelhow would i know otherwise, i guess? maybe i??m supposed to be like this.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-questioning and uncertainty about personal feelings and experiences, which can be common in many individuals regardless of their loneliness status. the writer appears to be grappling with their emotions and wondering if their current state is something they deserve or are meant to experience. however, there is no explicit mention of isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected from others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is more on internal contemplation and existential questioning. the absence of clear references to social relationships or a desire for connection suggests that the individual's feelings may be more related to self-reflection and personal growth rather than loneliness."
"thoughts to sharethis is what people do when they don??t understand one another,they hurt and continue to hurt when they can??t understand. Especially people that can??t understand or don??t know how to love,because it??s confusing it??s a lot it??s hard to love yourself so only imagine how it is to love somebody else truly. i have never had a problem understanding my own love it??s understanding other people??s love and how they perceive another??s love. i understand in all its simplicity how i love people and why and how that love comes about. I am able to love other people as it is the same to breathe,i am able to love myself subconsciously but it is hard for people to love me, it??s hard maybe cause i put myself out of reach,i don??t allow people to understand me. i don??t think or act how the majority does i always say i think i??m before myself,i feel stuck like i??m in the wrong place all the time. The way i love is first through affirmation,i??m too loyal to  disloyalty this is my biggest mistake. Then it is the semi attachment obtained from hours upon hours of endless talking and conversation in one time because one doesn??t simply do this because they are bored it because it means something? incorrect this is my second mistake people are unpredictable,sly and manipulative characteristics someone like me fails to see as i only see the best in people even if it means i have to invent it myself. People can pretend for the fun of it or to gain something out of it. this i know all to well because when loving or feeling i have always been put in the same position different exterior same interior, each boy with a different look each with the same intent and goal. For there has never been one boy who has kept me and solely me in their heart,i have never been anything but 2nd best. I am nothing more than someone to pass the time with until something better comes along, this has broken my heart too many times for me to feel,i will admit i don??t feel love because why would you when it only proves to be destructive why would you want to feel that so i turned that feeling off believe it or not. i stopped falling for words,i stopped falling for actions. i stopped falling. Instead i followed, i followed back on the words i followed the actions i reciprocated in a way as to keep up appearances. i saw the wolf dressing up in the sheep??s outfit and i did nothing but go along with it??s actions until the day it would decide to undress. because all wolfs get tired of sheep??s clothing especially when they meet something else. It was just a case of seeing who could hold out the longest my mask or my feelings. When the wolf begun to start undressing which didn??t take long it didn??t hurt i didn??t feel anything but anger,angry that a wolf could think they deceived me a wolf running and screaming to the mountains it deceived me when it was not me  that was deceived but the wolf, i let you think you had me and that you played when it was me that was going off on you,laughing at the things you would say,rolling my eyes. not even slightly amazed at the actions you put together. i over analyse and create patterns that aren??t apparent i do this and go off this. I wish i hadn??t been broken so much times,the more you break something the more and more it fails to work as it did,i fear loneliness because that??s what this does to me the fear of not being able to trust,not being able to feel,how can you form a connection with someone you can??t feel for or can??t trust because at all costs you cannot afford to get broken again because you cannot guarantee to yourself that you will still function, what an upsetting cycle it is for someone who longs to be loved that can never be loved. Someone who cannot have a guard up as every person is ??different?? and will offer something new and the bombardments of what if. what if this one is the one i mustn??t shut him out in fear he will only look else where. This is how i love and can never be loved. His words echo in my mind. ??There is no one for you ?? it repeats in a dead tone in the front of my mind. ??there is no one for?? a destroying sentence in itself, there is not a single person in the world in the great mass of people not one person will be compatible for me, this isn??t a stranger saying this to me it is at the time my boyfriend whom i??ve loved for 3 years and been with for a year the boy who told me he wanted a future with me is the same boy who told me no one is compatible for me. not even himself and this wasn??t said in a way as i am so superior nobody deserves my love or can even level me it was said in a way that i should spend the rest of my life alone because i do not deserve to love anybody. this was said with nothing but malice and anger. i don??t trust words or actions so how do you plan to prove you love me for real and how do you expect me to fall for you",0,"the narrative reveals a deep introspection and contemplation about love, trust, and self-worth. the author articulates their understanding of love and the difficulties they face in receiving and perceiving love from others. they acknowledge the complexity of human emotions and relationships, reflecting on past experiences that have shaped their current outlook. despite the painful experiences and feelings of betrayal, there is an underlying resilience and awareness. the author recognizes their own patterns and the protective mechanisms they've developed, such as overanalyzing and creating emotional barriers. while there is a fear of loneliness and a struggle with trust, the narrative does not convey a sense of isolation or disconnection from others. instead, it highlights a profound engagement with the self and a critical examination of interpersonal dynamics, suggesting an ongoing journey towards understanding and healing."
"Very strange problemSo recently I started posting about how I am alone, how much I want a girlfriend, etc. I do not feel all the time like that, usually I am self sufficient. Currently I feel great and I do not want to have friends or a girlfriend. I want to keep working on my goals.

What's wrong with me?) 

My perception of happiness is strongly affected by my hormones.

Today I feel like a God who made a smart choice to pursue my goals instead of girlfriends and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I can get a girlfriend and friends, the problem is I do not always want to do so.

What would you recommend me?",0,"the narrative reflects a fluctuating perception of social needs and self-sufficiency. the individual acknowledges periods of desiring companionship, but these desires are not constant and seem to be influenced by hormonal changes. they express contentment with focusing on personal goals rather than seeking relationships, suggesting a level of self-assurance and fulfillment in their current pursuits. the acknowledgment of being able to form relationships if desired indicates confidence and a lack of desperation typically associated with loneliness. the variability in their feelings and the current sense of well-being and purpose point to a complex but generally positive self-assessment, rather than persistent loneliness."
Would anyone like to talk?I literally just can??t sleep at night no matter what. I have nothing to do and was wondering if anyone wants to talk about anything.,0,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing difficulty sleeping and seeking conversation to pass the time. the request for interaction and the mention of having nothing to do might initially suggest loneliness, but there are several indicators that point to a different interpretation. the tone of the message is straightforward and lacks the deeper emotional distress often associated with loneliness. the individual is actively reaching out for communication, which suggests a proactive approach rather than a sense of isolation. additionally, the absence of expressions of sadness, hopelessness, or feelings of being disconnected from others further supports the notion that this person is not experiencing loneliness. their message appears to be more about seeking engagement and distraction during sleepless nights rather than a cry for help or companionship stemming from loneliness."
Drank 2 beer stomach empty quickly in bed now im all weird and i want cuddles;-;,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual consumed alcohol on an empty stomach and subsequently felt unwell. the mention of wanting cuddles suggests a desire for comfort and physical affection, which can be a common human need rather than an indication of loneliness. the brevity and casual tone of the narrative, along with the use of emoticons, imply a transient and possibly light-hearted expression of discomfort rather than a deeper, chronic sense of isolation. the immediate context of feeling ""weird"" after drinking and the specific wish for cuddles in that moment do not necessarily point to an ongoing experience of loneliness, but rather a temporary state influenced by the effects of alcohol."
Here for conversation ??????Nothing makes me feel better then being able to make someone smile just by offering some encouraging words.I wanna make you feel loved and appreciate you. I wanna hear about your day and how I could possibly help to make it better.

Funny thing is that it didn??t used to be hard cause I had a decent amount of friends when I was a kid.,0,"the narrative reflects a self-awareness of perceived deficits in relationship skills and a voice problem that the individual believes makes it difficult to form friendships or romantic connections. however, the individual also mentions having had a decent amount of friends during childhood, which indicates a past ability to establish and maintain social connections. this suggests that the current difficulties may be situational or related to specific circumstances rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the reflection on past positive social experiences and the current self-assessment point to a concern about social skills rather than an overwhelming feeling of loneliness."

"""Turning off"" my humanityI finally have reached my breaking point in regards to dating and relationships. I've been burned one too many times.

I was starting to date a woman. Everything seemed to be going great. Great conversation, great chemistry, all being confirmed on both ends.

Get a text bright and early after a 24 hour period of nothing from her. Got the lovely gift of ""I've actually been talking to another guy at the same time and we had a better date yesterday so I'm going to pursue a relationship with him instead.""

So many things she said the day before were done so to keep me on hold until she could have this date with this other guy. Which means I was the backup plan should that one not go so well. What a great feeling that was. And it hurt for about an hour.

But then I started thinking about the whole experience in general and how I just keep getting hurt and disappointed. How my feelings were consistently being hurt, my heart ripped over and over. I'm tired of that pain. 

So, I decided to flip the switch on my emotions. It wasn't instant but by the end of the day I can say I really don't feel any emotions, good or bad. I'm just existing. And to be quite honest, it's kind of liberating.

No one can hurt me now. Pain and anger can just fall into a black hole of nothingness. Sure, happiness and all that gets taken away but I'd rather feel nothing than feel that pain anymore.

"I want that one person in the world who will be mine forever, who I'd never doubt if they love me. And I love back.Where are you?",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for a deep and lasting connection with another person, which is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the yearning for a trustworthy and reciprocal relationship is a typical expression of seeking meaningful companionship, rather than an indication of current isolation or loneliness. the phrasing ""who will be mine forever"" and ""who i'd never doubt if they love me"" suggests an idealistic longing for a perfect partner rather than expressing feelings of being alone or disconnected. the question ""where are you?"" implies hope and anticipation for future connection, rather than a present state of loneliness. overall, the narrative's focus on the desire for a future relationship rather than lamenting current social isolation supports the classification."

Why do I do that?,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and self-criticism about the writer's behavior and emotional responses, specifically their tendency to become easily obsessed with others. while there is clear emotional turmoil, the focus is more on the individual's self-perception and the impact of their actions rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the writer's awareness of their pattern and the distress it causes suggests an internal conflict rather than an overarching feeling of loneliness. the narrative does not describe a lack of social connections or a deep-seated feeling of being alone, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a struggle with personal behavior and emotional regulation."
Just make it stopPls just make it stop I don't care how just make it stop,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of overwhelming distress and desperation, but it does not explicitly indicate loneliness. the plea for something to stop suggests the presence of intense emotional pain or a difficult situation, yet there are no clear references to feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or absence of meaningful relationships, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the urgent need for relief from an unspecified source of suffering. while loneliness can contribute to such distress, the narrative lacks specific elements that would directly point to loneliness as the primary issue."

"MondayAnybody else dread turning up to work on a Monday and being asked ""what did you do"" by a work colleague.",0,"the narrative reflects a common sentiment of disliking the start of the workweek and the mundane small talk that often accompanies it. the individual expresses annoyance at the routine question about their weekend activities, which suggests a sense of normalcy and social interaction, albeit superficial. this type of response is typical of many people who experience work-related fatigue or social discomfort, rather than loneliness. there is no indication of deeper emotional isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. instead, the frustration seems directed at the predictability and perhaps the perceived triviality of the question, rather than a feeling of being disconnected or alone. this context aligns with a person who is socially integrated but may simply be weary of repetitive social conventions."
"Im getting worse.I've always been told that talking to people helps when you are in a bad place. When you feel as if you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. I tried. I talked to 2 good friends, some of the only ones I've got and I'm glad to have. And I don't know why, but talking to them made it worse. It felt as if I was forcing my problems into the lives of those who have enough to deal with as it is.
Whats wrong with me? People say it gets better. Hell, I say it'll get better. I say ""I'll be fine, I'll be fine"". And yet I never am and I'm always ""fine"" or ""okay"" because I have to be. I can't let my family know whats going on, because they are stressed enough as it is.

What the f*ck is wrong with me? Why can't I sort my own bloody problems out? Why are they getting worse.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and helplessness. the individual describes attempts to reach out to friends but feels that sharing their burdens only exacerbates their feelings of guilt and self-doubt. despite acknowledging the support of friends and the commonly advised notion that ""it gets better,"" the person remains trapped in a cycle of self-reassurance that fails to alleviate their distress. the narrative also highlights a significant concern for the well-being of others, leading to a reluctance to share their struggles with family members. this self-imposed isolation and the persistent questioning of their own worth and capability to manage their issues are indicative of someone experiencing emotional turmoil and a sense of disconnection from meaningful support."
Spend a Lovely Evening With Your Boyfriend Eating Pizza... Boyfriend Roleplay Audiohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLuwx2-J4IU,0,"the narrative suggests a positive and engaging social interaction, which is typically an indicator of non-loneliness. spending a lovely evening with a significant other, such as a boyfriend, and enjoying an activity like eating pizza implies companionship and shared experiences. the mention of ""boyfriend roleplay audio"" further indicates a sense of involvement and connection, even if it is through imaginative means. these elements point towards a fulfilled social life and emotional satisfaction, which are not common in individuals experiencing loneliness. the overall tone and content reflect engagement and presence in meaningful relationships, countering the hallmarks of loneliness such as isolation, lack of connection, and emotional distress."
"im dyingif anyone cares to save me

dm me",0,"the narrative, despite its alarming tone, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the brevity and urgency suggest a cry for help, but this can stem from various emotional states, not solely loneliness. often, loneliness is characterized by a sense of prolonged isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, and feelings of being misunderstood or unseen over time. here, the narrative lacks context about ongoing social disconnection or an absence of supportive relationships. instead, it reflects a moment of acute distress, which can be related to other psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, or a situational crisis. the call for immediate intervention (""dm me"") implies the person believes there is someone out there who might respond, indicating a perceived presence of others who could potentially provide support, which contrasts with the typical chronic sense of abandonment found in loneliness."
"I don't what I'm doing.My ex boyfriend has a Reddit account. I keep thinking maybe he sent me a screenshot with his username in the background. I can't stop thinking about looking for it. The only reason I don't is because I don't feel like crying for hours rifling through old pictures. But I eventually will it's not a matter of if I will, it's when I will. I hate this person I am. The thought of talking to him again and him not even knowing it's me is such an amazing thought though. Creepy, I know, I'm a disgusting freak, yea I get it. I just miss him so much, I can't think straight. He was seriously my best friend.",0,"the narrative revolves around a deep emotional turmoil centered on a past relationship. while the individual expresses a sense of longing and distress over their ex-boyfriend, there are key elements that suggest this is more about specific emotional pain related to the breakup rather than a broader experience of loneliness. the focus is on the obsessive thoughts about the ex-partner and the self-loathing that comes with it. however, the narrative lacks broader themes of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a specific, intense emotional reaction to a past relationship, which can be an isolated incident rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness. the individual’s mention of their ex being their best friend indicates they had a significant connection, further suggesting that their distress is situational and tied to this particular loss rather than a general state of loneliness."
"Well, I'm meant to be single forever.nan",0,"the narrative suggests a resigned acceptance of being single, which can be interpreted in various ways. the phrase ""meant to be single forever"" might indicate a sense of fatalism or acceptance rather than distress. there is no explicit mention of feelings of isolation, longing for companionship, or distress about being alone, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the statement could reflect a personal choice or a neutral observation about one's relationship status. the absence of emotional language or expressions of unhappiness about being single suggests that the individual might not be experiencing loneliness. they may simply be stating a perceived fact about their life without attaching negative emotions to it."
"Is someone willing to talk to me?I just want to talk to someone, I'm so broken right now and crying and I just need someone to talk to",0,"the narrative expresses a clear and immediate need for social interaction and emotional support, which might initially suggest feelings of loneliness. however, the plea for conversation and the emotional distress described could be situational, indicating a temporary state rather than chronic loneliness. the use of phrases like ""i just want to talk to someone"" and ""i am so broken right now"" suggests a momentary crisis or acute emotional episode rather than a prolonged sense of isolation. this kind of urgent appeal for connection often occurs during times of intense stress or personal hardship, which can be resolved with immediate support and does not necessarily indicate a persistent feeling of loneliness."
Are the following things widely believed about women and ageing?:[removed],0,"the narrative in question doesn't exhibit signs typically associated with loneliness. instead, it appears to focus on societal beliefs and perceptions about women and aging, which suggests an intellectual or curious engagement with the topic rather than a personal emotional experience of loneliness. the absence of personal feelings, expressions of isolation, or mentions of a lack of social connections indicates that the author is more interested in exploring external viewpoints rather than expressing an internal sense of loneliness. this external focus is often a sign of someone who is not currently experiencing loneliness, as they are engaging with broader societal issues rather than introspective concerns about their own social and emotional state."
"You are safe. You are protected. You are cared for. Your dreams and goals may be on pause, but they are not canceled. Take this time to heal a bit more, to decompress, to reset. Be prepared to return to your normal way of life in a state of wholeness, fullness, and focus.nan",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of reassurance and encouragement, indicating that the author feels supported and optimistic about the future. phrases like ""you are safe,"" ""you are protected,"" and ""you are cared for"" suggest a strong presence of security and emotional support. the emphasis on taking time to heal, decompress, and reset points to a healthy coping mechanism and self-care practice. the anticipation of returning to a ""normal way of life"" with ""wholeness, fullness, and focus"" implies a positive outlook and a belief in personal growth and resilience. these elements are not typical indicators of loneliness; instead, they reflect a well-supported individual who feels connected and hopeful."
If you're lonely or want to be there for someone who is lonely......feel free to dm me and we can talk about stuff maybe.,0,"the narrative suggests a willingness to reach out and connect with others, which is a proactive and positive social behavior. the author expresses an openness to engage in conversation and provide support, indicating a sense of empathy and social responsibility. this behavior is generally associated with individuals who have a certain level of social competence and emotional stability. the invitation to ""dm me and we can talk about stuff"" shows a readiness to establish and maintain social connections, which is not typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of social withdrawal, feelings of isolation, and difficulty in initiating social interactions, none of which are evident in this narrative. therefore, the narrative reflects a supportive and socially engaged mindset rather than one of loneliness."
"I??m just emptyLike, nothing really makes me happy anymore. And I know this is that classic ??oh whoah is me?? stereotype kinda shit but it??s true. I just don??t give a shit anymore.  I??m not actively sad I??m just never happy. I get up and go to work and do school and sleep. Playing games, jacking off, talking to people, none of it gives me any feeling at all. I found myself just fully walking away from conversations cause nobody really cares about me and I don??t care about them. So I guess I??ll just keep going and hope I find any form of enjoyment in anything. And if not I??ll die and that will be the end I??ll delete this post soon anyway",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of emotional numbness and apathy, with the individual describing a lack of happiness or interest in activities that previously might have brought joy. despite the bleak tone, there are indications that the person is not necessarily isolated or lacking social connections, as they mention engaging in conversations and interacting with others, even if these interactions feel meaningless to them. the overall sentiment suggests a struggle with motivation and finding purpose, which can be associated with various mental health issues beyond loneliness, such as depression or burnout. the individual's awareness of their own emotional state and the acknowledgment of stereotypical self-pity also hint at a level of self-reflection that may be inconsistent with the more pervasive and consuming nature of loneliness. while the narrative reflects significant emotional distress, the presence of social interactions and the specific focus on a lack of happiness rather than a sense of isolation are critical factors in understanding the classification."
Stop pretending and lying[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a direct and assertive tone, suggesting that the author is addressing someone with a demand to cease certain behaviors. the straightforward nature of the statement indicates a sense of confidence and determination. this lack of hesitation and clear communication often signifies that the individual feels secure and is not struggling with feelings of isolation or loneliness. typically, those experiencing loneliness may express themselves with more ambiguity, hesitation, or indirect language as they grapple with their emotions and a sense of disconnection. in this case, the narrative does not exhibit such characteristics, aligning more with someone who is not experiencing loneliness."
Think I've decided[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of decision-making and possibly a resolution. while it lacks detailed context, the absence of expressions of emotional distress, isolation, or a longing for social connection points away from loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include explicit mentions of feeling alone, disconnected, or yearning for companionship. the brevity and straightforward nature of this narrative do not exhibit these characteristics, indicating a more neutral or resolved state of mind rather than one marked by loneliness."
"Ability to disconnect?Is there a way to disconnect your feeling of wanting companions/friends? I really hate this feeling of wanting to be liked, wanting to be loved and caring about what others think about me. I want to be able to do stuff on my own without feeling judged about it E. G. Going to the cinema on my own, shopping and other miscellaneous things that you normally need a friend to do.",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for independence and a struggle with societal expectations rather than loneliness. the individual discusses a wish to disconnect from the need for external validation and the pressure of being liked or judged by others. this indicates a level of self-awareness and a desire for personal growth, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the focus is on overcoming the discomfort associated with solo activities and seeking self-sufficiency, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. the mention of wanting to enjoy activities alone suggests a pursuit of autonomy rather than a reflection of loneliness."
"A truer end to the past two years - nothing left to dream2 years and a bit ago, at 15, I was in a mental hospital on the advice of my GP for depression. I had life which by then had become more consciously grim, though from childhood, I never had many friends and was mocked quite often. My school life was particularly grey, only every enjoying myself in jokes. The place the GP had sent me too was a tad excessive for what was actually wrong, but it was a modern and nice looking facility and he probably thought it was the best thing he could arrange. &amp;#x200B;I don't know if many people have been in similar mental hospital youth units, but my own perception (coloured by the fact I did not probably have a real discernible illness to hang over me), was like that of a summer camp with a side-function, and with similarly marginal people. We had our own rooms with our own bathrooms, a central lobby with a TV, DVD player and Wii. 2 couches and maybe six chairs? That was the social area anyway. God knows how long we spent there. Then there was a kitchen (we did OT activities every week like cooking and baking), an arts and crafts room which effectively doubled as a back-up social place. We went on trips out every now and again, to the cinema and the zoo and that. We were supervised by a bunch of nurses, in my mind divided between the young ones who were social and friendly to us, and the slightly older ones who were bossy and cold. &amp;#x200B;I was very awkward with people when I first went in. I mostly remember my life so far in general in different embarrassing events that have happened thus far. The first person who met me was a 13 year old girl with borderline disorder (which I found out much later). Immediately started being very friendly with me, insisted on painting my face every day for nearly a week straight. Was very happy initially. No one had ever had so much concern for me. However, as I later found out, borderline often results in random and fleeting obsessions. There was a guy who was a bit more contrivedly macho, though I was friendly with due common lad culture which I wasn't completely out of where I grew up. Depression and anger, I can only sum his problems being. After a few days another person was admitted, a guy who was as weedy as me but lankier. I wish we could have been greater friends, but I always struggled to have something to say to him. There was a posh-ish girl, who loved stock phrases, and didn't really mix with the others. I only figure she felt above the whole alt/marginal social bubble the social was. A guy who was 15, looked 8. A sporty girl who didn't say much, or didn't have much to say. A wealthy girl from the country, who was more mildly mad. That was  the first period. All nice people, who were good friends to me until they went. Was the first time I really felt like I had a community of friends, like I had a discernible social life. Part of that is because of the fact that it's a live-in unit, and people are practically forced to become acquainted to you. &amp;#x200B;There was a second distinct period of my stay, which I define by being more confident at that period. People told me I was funny a lot at this time. I don't know if it was just in the general spirit of 'wholesome support' to be complimentary or genuine, but from the moodiness of school, I always did want to make any situation a laugh. I had the same ratio of gaffes and embarrassments I've always had, but I had a bit of an ego. People were discharged and new people came in, which meant I could give a more tailored impression to them. Part of this period was a then-male friend who said they were trans (and later proved it to my surprise), a pair of socialites (in my perception) which comprised a FtM boy and a chubby guy who called himself autistic (I'm not so sure of). There was a girl with a squeaky voice who told a very disturbing, but seemingly unlikely story. There was a country girl with a bad family history. A kind of a cringey guy who wore Star Wars helmets and talked all the time about his 14 year old girlfriend (he was 17, slightly weird).&amp;#x200B;Then came in a thin girl, very pale. I remember she sat down with her feet on the seat, sipping one of those fattening milk drinks you give to people with eating disorders. I wanted to talk to her, but after a while she was scooped up into the group of the ED girls. Gradually started to have a bit of an infatuation with her. This largely involved me catching long glances at her from the opposite couch before anyone would notice. We didn't talk that much, really. When it was her birthday and her family came in to visit I remember making her laugh by dancing outside her room. Then we'd interact when part of the group when making prank calls and that. I remember being asked if I had a crush in the unit, which I didn't want to answer as I knew my chances were low and if it were not mutual it would only lead to awkwardness. In the faux-jewellery making class, I made her a bracelet with her initials and astrological sign (she was into that sort of thing), and she gave it back not understanding it to be a gift which I took to mean something worse. I flirted with her one day, attempting to pass it off as a joke (which would've been easy given how I acted), and I didn't get any resistance.I was told the next day on weekend leave after probing accidental clues left by one of the friends that she did like me. That was the best single experience of my life so far. I had never felt that given who I was physically and mentally, that a girl would like me. I just felt like everything was going to work out fine. We were 'coupled' immediately the next day. We were being supervised, so we couldn't do much apart from sit next to each other or hold hands under a coat the few times we went to the cinema. But I was in a trance. She was such a soft and warm person, who would play along with every attempt I had to make a joke. I always sat next to her. When she picked out songs for the 'music appreciation activity I resonated with her. We watched Moulin Rouge 5 times. I laughed more with her than anyone else. Though I was still anxious about things and made mistakes, I got toy slime in her one day hair accidentally, which I knew was really bad, but she was entirely sweet to me even though I knew I made her upset. I tried to kiss her at the cinema. With people next to us...and while she was obviously not feeling it right to be the time, she was still kind about it. I was for the first time in my life really feeling something amazing. I wanted us to just get closer and closer, despite the fact that she lived a bit away from me and I'd be leaving the unit soon. She was anorexic, and I found out through her mainly how terrible the experience was. We ate together every day, and I began to properly notice how they struggled picking the food off the cutlery. She was managing though, and with generally being brought out of her own shell, I knew she was going to be fineI was always vague in my 'treatment' at the hospital, and that meant that I was there for 3 months, although I was content with that. Having friends made me feel much better than any of the support options they had there. When I finally ran out of time, I still was in the bubble via a groupchat.  I texted my new girlfriend every day. Though my life was very dull afterwards, the mindless optimism of the unit made me ignore it. Texting her was everything to me then. The others did not really try to contact me on their own initiative. I should have done it myself, but I just felt like not having them in person would not work out. We met up as groups on 2 or 3 occasions, which was as fun as I imagined. I got to kiss her in my friend's bathroom on of these times, which was stiffer than I had imagined. I wanted to go deeper. I asked her everything I could imagine, about what she wanted in the future. We managed one date to a film. The distance was more of a problem then I thought as I struggled to pay for and arrange buses as the right time. Then she became more distant to me. Only giving shallow replies and that. I had to be accomodatable given the problems she had, so I did give her space for a few weeks. I talked to her one time about how maybe it would be a good idea to talk via phone or video chat. She responded about how she was 'proud' of the fact that she could say no, even though I had only suggested it to fix the distance I thought was mutually problematic. I wasn't pushy at this time, but when she said this I got a little perturbed and just mentioned it. She apologised, and I thought about how to approach this, if we could try to figure something mutually beneficial out. The next day she replied about how I was talking to her wasn't 'acceptable'. I thought maybe she had talked to her friends, exaggerated the problem a bit as one naturally does when looking for empathy, and they advised to her be more assertive or something, despite the lack of a real issue. And at this point, I started behaving the worse. I snapped at her and insulted her with something really terrible, which I didn't really mean, but was directed at the lack of concern I thought she had for me at this point. We roughly patched things up after I talked to her friend, but she went a bit cold. Because she had a more serious illness than me, I felt I couldn't act as a wedge between her and the general closeness of the friend group when it offered it support. I left the group chat and that. One person contacted me after. I had lost all my friends just like that. I don't know why I didn't say anything after this. I really don't. More than anything I don't understand my motive or reason. I didn't talk to her for a few months after this. I had some feeling that I had to wait. I felt like things could work out in time, but I felt like I couldn't talk to her \*right now\*. There was one person from the unit I had intermittent contact with, who was similarly as low as I am, but they gradually got exhausted with me and they're now gone.I did send her some jokes after that. This led to a conversation where she told me she didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore. At that point I knew that all of the good I thought the hospital that left me with, and the social life I thought I could get back was completely gone. I told her I was suicidal.  I wanted her to be sympathetic. I broke down, and she blocked me after I suggested I was doing harm to her now. I tried a few weeks later with a really pathetic attempt that just put me in A&amp;E for a dozen hours. &amp;#x200B;She never came back around after that. I watched her online presence. I made new accounts to talk to her which she blocked. I had no friends.I moved school due to failing performance. I thought I'd make friends, but I wasn't able to, and I had a worse sense of social isolation. It went by like that, I was eighteen. I'm now going into college in September, trying to get through summer. Every few months there was a new profile picture for her. Her account with go intermittantly public than private. A few weeks ago I got a response from her finally, filled with just courtesies and telling me she wanted to avoid me because she wanted to 'close that chapter of my life'.Then yesterday I saw for the first time another guy in the pictures, with his own profile picture featuring her, and captions featuring both of them from her friends. I can't look at the pictures any more. I've shut down all my accounts because I don't want to have to see that again. I can't fantasise of having her back because that ugly interferrance would come into it. I felt that even if my social life was gone, even if I can't ever be with her ever again. She would always be mine, just in a detached, virtual way. The image of her with someone else is too much. It's disgusting and repulsive. It shows that she's now gone entirely from the scene of my mind. I thought we were in the same place, separate. She is happy with someone else, and with her friends. She thinks of me as a gross, ugly villain from her past, and she's right. I have always been possessive. I am not actually attractive or personably appealing at all. She had been alone for 6 months in a bedsit, in hospitals, as those caring for her did not understand what was wrongfor some reason. She was isolated, and when she went into the unit, she found friends, and with the cabin fever she had, imagined me in her head to befunnier, more good looking than I was. When I went back to school, and people had found out, they did not believe I had a girlfriend. When she blossomed, she knew how little value I actually was to her. I fucked up, lost her and allowed any connection which I could have maintained to fall away. I was never going to get her back after that few months. And now, I am not even a romantic thing lost. I am just an ugly component of regret and anecdotes.For the last two years she was still my girl in my head. The one thing I had always wanted was to hold her in my arms in bed as we'd both drift off to sleep. It actually kept me awake, but every night I still thought of it. I wish I never had the unit because it gave me expectations that I never should have had. If I had just continued living as I did, maybe I'd find a better groove alone to live by. I wouldn't be deluded into thinking that people would love me as much I love them. But here I am. I will never do better than her. Now, I am alone. I know I am not going to get a life in college, as I did not one in the new school. I have no friends who care about me. I tried to get some help through stupid appeals on my social media but people are just not involved with me anymore. This is the time where it all closes in.",0,"the narrative describes a complex journey through mental health challenges and social dynamics within a youth mental hospital. despite the initial grim circumstances and feelings of social isolation, the author finds a sense of community and even experiences a romantic relationship, which provides a brief period of happiness and belonging. the detailed recounting of interactions with various individuals and the emotional highs and lows suggests a deep engagement with others, albeit within a controlled environment. the subsequent loss of these connections and the struggle to adapt to life outside the unit reflect a significant emotional upheaval, yet the narrative consistently highlights moments of social interaction and support. the author's introspection and acknowledgment of personal flaws, alongside the vivid portrayal of relationships, indicate a rich social life that, despite its imperfections, counters the notion of pervasive loneliness. the eventual closure of social media accounts and the acceptance of the end of a significant relationship mark a painful but necessary step towards moving forward, suggesting resilience rather than isolation."
"GamingI'm stupid. I'm stupid for buying games that well, you can play solo, but we're meant for multiplayer. I realize the reason why I can get bored of games so easily is because I have nobody to play with. Anyone else indulge in these type of games and then realize there's nobody to play with?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is engaging in self-reflection about their gaming habits and expressing frustration over their purchasing decisions. they acknowledge buying games designed for multiplayer experiences but find themselves playing solo, leading to boredom. the key elements here are the frustration and realization about the mismatch between the game's intended use and their solitary play. while there is an acknowledgment of playing alone, the tone and context suggest a situational frustration rather than deep-seated loneliness. the person is questioning their decisions and seeking validation or shared experiences from others, indicating a desire for social interaction but not necessarily chronic loneliness. the narrative lacks deeper emotional expressions or signs of isolation that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses more on a specific activity and the immediate dissatisfaction stemming from it."
"People take me for grantedI feel like if you show you are understanding the first time someone cancels your plans,then they will always cancel  plans on you in the future. I hate that people take me for granted. Like sure ,they can cancel or postpone when something important has happened,but telling me to stand by just in case their other friends want to hang out with them is just purely selfish.",0,"the narrative reflects frustration and disappointment with how others treat the individual, particularly in terms of feeling taken for granted. the writer expresses irritation at being a backup option and perceives others' actions as selfish. while these feelings are valid and indicate a level of dissatisfaction with social interactions, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the focus is on the behavior of others rather than a deep sense of isolation or longing for connection. the writer's awareness of being mistreated and their anger about it suggest a recognition of social boundaries and self-worth, rather than a pervasive sense of being alone or disconnected."
"Having the worst night f/25If you??re bored, we can talk about whatever in the comments (I??d prefer not to talk about why my night is bad) 

Hmu",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is seeking social interaction and distraction from a bad night but does not exhibit signs of deep loneliness. the person explicitly mentions a preference to avoid discussing the reasons behind their bad night, which suggests a desire to engage in conversation for relief rather than a cry for emotional support. this indicates a level of self-awareness and control over their emotional state. the casual tone and openness to talking about ""whatever"" imply that the individual is looking for light-hearted engagement rather than addressing a deeper emotional void. this behavior aligns more with someone experiencing a temporary situation rather than chronic loneliness. the use of ""hmu"" (hit me up) also conveys a sense of casual, everyday communication, further suggesting that the individual is accustomed to reaching out and connecting with others in a normal, non-lonely manner."
"If You Need SomeoneIf you need someone to talk to, someone to listen, or a new friend, PM me! We're all getting through this!",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is reaching out to offer support and companionship to others, indicating a sense of social connectedness and empathy. the use of inclusive language such as ""we're all getting through this"" implies a shared experience and a collective effort to overcome challenges, which typically reflects a person who feels part of a community. the willingness to engage with others and provide a listening ear or friendship demonstrates proactive social behavior and a positive outlook, which are generally not associated with feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative conveys a sense of belonging and a desire to help others, which are strong indicators of non-loneliness."
I wish I could just * *stops existing* *[deleted],0,"the narrative, though brief and marked by a sense of despair, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it expresses a desire to cease existing, which can be linked to various emotional states, including depression or overwhelming stress, but not exclusively loneliness. there is no mention of social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being misunderstood, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the deletion of the message might suggest a momentary outburst rather than a chronic state of loneliness. without more context on the individual's social interactions or sense of belonging, it's challenging to directly attribute this narrative to loneliness. instead, it seems more indicative of a transient emotional crisis."
I CANT STOP SCREAMINGWHY WONT SOMEONE JUST TALK TO ME???? PLEASE PLEASE,0,"the narrative suggests a high level of distress and a strong desire for social interaction, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, the extreme expression of emotions and the urgency in the plea for communication could point towards an acute emotional episode rather than a chronic state of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness typically describe a persistent feeling of being disconnected or isolated over time, rather than an immediate and intense outburst. the lack of descriptive elements about ongoing feelings of isolation or a prolonged absence of meaningful connections further supports the interpretation that this narrative is not reflective of a chronic loneliness experience. instead, it may represent a momentary crisis or an intense emotional reaction to a specific situation."

There are just so much festivals, especially in North India where I live, every other month is a major festival in which every one participate like Holi, diwali,navratri, janmastami,etc. They surely are wet dreams for an social extrovert person, but they are nightmare for a person like me.",0,"the narrative highlights the challenges faced by an individual with social anxiety in india, emphasizing the lack of mental health awareness, the high cost and limited availability of therapists, and the overwhelming nature of frequent social festivals. despite these difficulties, the individual's focus on systemic issues and external factors, rather than on feelings of isolation or disconnection from others, suggests that their primary concern is navigating social anxiety rather than experiencing loneliness. the detailed description of the cultural context and the comparison between the experiences of extroverts and introverts further indicate a struggle with social participation rather than a deep sense of loneliness."
"Trying to pretend this feeling doesn't hurtIt seems weird posting here but also accurate. I have wonderful friends and a supportive family but recently, let's say very recently I lost a connection that I feel I may have took for granted. Can't go into it right now but they left a void and at first I thought hey whatever I have others. But each day, hell every hour I seem to realize more and more that I'll never be able to fill it. I feel like a lot of folks on this sub know the unrequited pain and yeah that is some of it but it's so much more. I could be myself with them not my normal restrained personality but truly open and vulnerable and weird, it didn't matter. They were so accepting and such a bright part of my life, I looked forward to spending any time I had with them and I think that's partly the reason things had to change. They're in a relationship, and god knows I was supportive through the whole thing but one slip up and crash. I don't even really know what it is that I want right now. I wish things could go back I wish I didn't have to lose a best friend but mostly I just wish them the best and I hope eventually things can get if not better at least back to neutral.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has experienced a recent loss of a significant relationship, which has left them feeling a void. despite this, the individual acknowledges having wonderful friends and a supportive family. this recognition of a strong support system is a crucial indicator of non-loneliness. while the person expresses a deep sense of loss and longing for the connection they had, they also show an understanding that they are not completely isolated. the ability to reflect on their feelings and the situation, and the wish for things to return to a state of normalcy, suggests resilience and a sense of hope. these elements are important in distinguishing between temporary feelings of sadness or grief and chronic loneliness. the narrative demonstrates an awareness of the supportive relationships they still have, which provides a buffer against the feelings of loneliness."
I am so tired of it[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of frustration and fatigue, but it lacks specific indicators typically associated with loneliness. there is no mention of social isolation, feelings of being misunderstood, or a desire for deeper connections with others. instead, the brief statement points more towards a general state of weariness or exasperation, which can stem from various sources such as stress, burnout, or dissatisfaction with certain aspects of life. without additional context or details, it is difficult to ascertain any underlying loneliness, making it more likely that the individual is dealing with a different type of emotional or mental strain."
All you get for trusting people is heartache and pain. [Rant][removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of betrayal and emotional pain from trusting others, but it lacks deeper context or elaboration on feelings of isolation or disconnection from others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the statement appears more as a reaction to specific negative experiences rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. it suggests a defensive stance against future hurt rather than an ongoing struggle with feeling alone. without further details about the person's social interactions or internal emotional state, it's challenging to conclude that the individual is experiencing loneliness. instead, the focus seems to be on the immediate emotional response to being let down by others."
Girls say i??m strangenan,0,"the narrative suggests a perception of being seen as strange by others, specifically girls. however, there is no indication of distress or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. the use of humor or a lighthearted tone, as implied by the misspelling and playful language, may indicate a level of social comfort and self-awareness. the individual does not express feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or sadness. instead, the narrative might reflect a unique personality or self-perception without the negative emotional impact that characterizes loneliness. overall, the absence of explicit emotional distress and the presence of a seemingly casual attitude suggest that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."

Pics in pro if you're curious.

Anyone care to chat?",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and a sense of boredom, but it doesn't necessarily indicate deep loneliness. the individual explicitly mentions feeling bored, which can be a temporary state rather than a chronic feeling of loneliness. the invitation to chat and the inclusion of pictures in their profile suggest they are open to connecting with others and possibly have some level of confidence in initiating interactions. these behaviors are not typical of someone experiencing significant loneliness, who might express feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of social connections more explicitly. the tone of the message is casual and seems to imply a momentary need for engagement rather than a deeper, ongoing struggle with loneliness."
"Alleviating loneliness for my momMy Mom is in her late sixties, lives alone, and is generally very healthy.

"Never Been Like This BeforeHello everyone, I hope everything get better for all of you.

As for myself, I'm 20 and my girlfriend of 3 years and 8-ish months broke it off with me a little bit ago. I'm still madly in love, but she is with someone else now.

I never realized how cold the bed is when they're not there. Even if they weren't sleeping beside me, I have the comfort of knowing they were out there.

She was my best friend. She was my first love, and now I lay awake at night, knowing I messed up, hoping I can fix it.

I don't think I can, but I will try. Everyone tells me to get over it. She's with someone else, so ""man the f*** up and move on"". But she was my life for all that I can remember. Maybe if I improve myself, I can be what I need to be to get her back.

I have a long road ahead of me, and I really want it to take me where I need to go. It would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep, and not wake up in the middle of the night, not knowing what to do.

Thanks for reading, sorry it's long. I've contacted a therapist, so we'll see where that takes me. 

I wish you all luck and I want you to know that everyone, here especially, deserves to be heard and listened to. You deserve kindness and respect and love. It's okay to be lonely, and it's absolutely alright to reach out. You aren't weak, you're strong for realizing what you need to do, and acting on it.

"How do I get over someone?I've had to do it before and it always took a while, but this time it's different. I thought she would be the one.

She said she would like to hangout again, but everytime I tried to set something up it was always ""maybe"" and then never happened. It's really fucking me up inside. Why would she ask me to hangout, hold my hand, kiss me, and then just stop showing any interest. I don't understand. I thought that I finally escaped this pit of perpetual loneliness only to be dragged even further down into it. Better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all I suppose.",0,"the narrative describes a person struggling with the emotional aftermath of a failed romantic connection. while the author expresses significant distress and confusion over the situation, there are key indicators that suggest they are not experiencing deep loneliness. they recount a recent intimate moment that gave them hope and excitement, indicating that they have the capacity to form connections and experience positive social interactions. their frustration seems to stem more from the unexpected change in the other person's behavior rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. they also reflect on past experiences of getting over someone, suggesting a familiarity with coping mechanisms and a resilience in facing such challenges. these elements point to situational sadness and disappointment rather than chronic loneliness."

If you even bother coming back, I'll be there. I'm sorry.",0,"the narrative expresses a strong desire to communicate and clear up a misunderstanding, which indicates the presence of social connections and concern for another person's well-being. the author apologizes and emphasizes their commitment to the relationship, suggesting they value the bond and are willing to take steps to maintain it. this behavior is typically seen in individuals who are actively engaged in social interactions and are not experiencing loneliness. the urgency to resolve the issue and the assurance that they will be available if the other person returns further demonstrates a proactive approach to maintaining their social network. these aspects highlight a sense of belonging and connection, which are not characteristic of loneliness."

"La solitude (1972)Hi everyone. I just wanted to share with you this song I listened to. This feeling she sings about, I know it too well. I think she was, like me suffering with avPD. She was abused by her father as a child. Despite her success she had a very secluded life. It seems she was very kind at heart, generous and showed lots of empathy towards the ones in need.

It's called ""La Solitude"" (French for loneliness). And it's like loneliness was a person (she) that wouldn't leave you alone!

Which means that I couldn??t go home for the holidays and probably won??t be able to go home until March at the earliest. Anyways, my parents are signing the divorce papers next week and i learned about it on Christmas ????",0,"the narrative reflects a situation filled with significant life changes and stressors, such as joining the navy, dealing with a backed-up schooling schedule, and learning about parents' divorce. however, the tone and context do not indicate feelings of loneliness. the individual does not express emotions of isolation or a lack of social connections. instead, the focus is on the logistical aspects of their situation and the unfortunate timing of the news about their parents. the absence of explicit mentions of feeling alone or disconnected from others suggests that, despite the challenging circumstances, the individual does not feel lonely. they seem to be more concerned with the practical implications of their situation rather than an emotional struggle with loneliness."

I explained that I didn't know she disliked me and that I just wanted to follow everyone in my grade on my new account and now they're all just acting like dicks to me. I feel like a piece of shit now for just trying to follow someone in my grade.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing frustration and confusion over a social misunderstanding. the writer details a situation where they repeatedly tried to follow a classmate on social media, only to receive hostile responses from peers. the person's feelings of being unfairly treated and their subsequent self-blame indicate a sensitivity to social dynamics and a desire for social integration. however, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of isolation or a pervasive sense of loneliness. the writer's primary concern revolves around a specific incident rather than a broader pattern of social disconnection. their focus on the immediate social conflict and the reaction of others suggests that their distress is situational and not necessarily indicative of chronic loneliness."
"I feel like I'm unwanted, unneeded. Like I'm just used space on this planet and I often ask myself should I just leavenan",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of being unwanted and unneeded, as well as existential questioning about one's purpose and place in the world. these emotions are often associated with deeper psychological issues such as depression or low self-esteem rather than loneliness specifically. while loneliness involves a sense of social isolation and a lack of meaningful connections, the narrative does not mention the absence of relationships or social interactions. instead, it focuses more on self-worth and existential concerns. the use of phrases like ""unwanted, unneeded"" and ""used space on this planet"" suggests a struggle with personal value and identity, which are critical indicators of other mental health challenges rather than loneliness."
I never had a sober conversation with a girl I was interested in.Like literally not a single one which consisted of more than a few sentences. Not even once during my entire fucking life.,0,"the narrative describes a lack of sober conversations with girls the author is interested in, which might suggest social anxiety or a lack of confidence in romantic interactions. however, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the absence of specific references to feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections with others suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness. instead, the focus is on a particular aspect of their social life, namely their interactions with potential romantic partners, rather than an overall sense of social disconnection. this distinction is important in understanding the underlying emotional state of the author."

Why do I feel like starting college is going to be one big competition for friends and relationships right awayAnd well I don??t really think I can compete,0,"the narrative reflects a concern about starting college and the perceived competition for forming friendships and relationships. the writer expresses anxiety about their ability to compete in this social arena, which is a common apprehension among new college students. however, this concern does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it suggests a fear of social inadequacy or self-doubt, which are typical feelings during major life transitions. the focus is on the anticipation of future social interactions rather than an existing state of isolation or loneliness. the absence of descriptions of current feelings of solitude, lack of social connections, or emotional distress related to being alone supports the classification. the writer's worries are future-oriented and tied to their self-confidence rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"Suicide prevention day is a joke at this pointSo suicide prevention day has passed and I figured I'd really write what I think about it. The people that preach all these crappy messages saying you're special and don't give up it'll be okay don't have an actual fucking clue on what it means to be alone, hurt, and damaged. They think they'll just post some stupid self-righteous message on instagram or twitter and act like they do such a great job at being an inspiration to people who have constant pain. Meanwhile they actually just go out with tons of friends and have fun and don't really give an rats ass about others who are truly alone. It's like a slap in the face when you see how alone you are and then these people say ""You're special and never alone."" when they are never actually alone. They have friends, family, and relationships and just enjoy life.",0,"the narrative expresses strong feelings of frustration and disillusionment with societal attitudes towards suicide prevention. the author criticizes the superficiality of social media messages and the disconnect between those who promote these messages and those who suffer from deep emotional pain. they highlight the perceived hypocrisy of people who claim to care but seem to lead fulfilling social lives themselves. however, despite the intense emotions and critique, the narrative does not delve into personal experiences of isolation or loneliness. instead, it focuses more on anger and resentment towards the broader societal response, rather than a personal account of feeling lonely or disconnected. this distinction is important in understanding the underlying sentiment and context of the narrative."

"Lately I've been lashing out at people to push them away, even making threats. The cops at my door would give me the push I need to stab my throat with a butcher knife.So yeah I'm done.

Not saying it's a waste of money, but it's definitely not something I need.",0,"the narrative depicts an individual who has been single for a significant period and has not had sexual experiences in a long time. however, despite the initial urge to seek out an escort, the person ultimately decides against it, prioritizing financial responsibility and personal contentment with their current activities, such as gaming. the language used indicates a casual and somewhat humorous approach to their situation, suggesting a level of acceptance and comfort with their solitude. the narrative does not convey feelings of deep sadness, isolation, or desperation that are often associated with loneliness. instead, it reflects a pragmatic and self-aware attitude towards their circumstances, focusing on practical considerations and personal fulfillment rather than emotional distress."
Please help me?? I am so lost[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a cry for help and expresses a feeling of being lost, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, the absence of deeper emotional context or elaboration on feelings of isolation and disconnection from others suggests that the primary issue may not be loneliness. instead, the individual's use of the phrase ""so lost"" could imply confusion or a need for guidance rather than a profound sense of loneliness. without more information about their social interactions, emotional state, or feelings of isolation, it's challenging to definitively attribute their distress to loneliness. the brevity and lack of specific details about their social experiences or emotional state are key factors in this assessment."

Anyone in Gothenburg want to be my friend?[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a straightforward request for friendship, which can be interpreted as a proactive and positive approach to social interaction. the individual is reaching out to others in a specific location, suggesting they are open to forming new connections and are not necessarily isolated. this kind of behavior often signifies a level of social confidence and willingness to engage with others, rather than experiencing deep loneliness. typically, loneliness is accompanied by expressions of sadness, despair, or a sense of hopelessness about forming relationships, none of which are present in this brief and direct query. the absence of negative emotional language and the presence of an active search for companionship suggest the person is socially engaged and optimistic about their social prospects."
Ever have a dream about a girl/boy and fall in love and then wake up and realise it's a just a dream :(It sucks :(,0,"the narrative describes an experience of dreaming about falling in love with someone and then waking up to the realization that it was only a dream. while this can be a disappointing and somewhat disheartening experience, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the expression of feeling let down by the dream's unreality is a common human experience and can happen to anyone, regardless of their social or emotional state. there is no mention of a lack of social connections, feelings of isolation, or a deep sense of being alone, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. the focus is on the transient nature of dreams and the emotional impact of waking up from a pleasant illusion, rather than on a persistent feeling of being disconnected from others."

I trusted him and i havent been with anyone in 6 months before that because i was focusing on myself and i was down bad before and now i feel like im downbad again. Why did i ruin those 6 months of me feeling good for this ?  I have not touched food and been crying nonstop. I feel worthless,0,"the narrative reflects a person who is experiencing intense emotional distress following a breakup. they describe feelings of rejection and betrayal, particularly because their ex-partner had knowledge of their past trauma. despite these feelings, the narrative focuses more on the immediate pain of the breakup rather than prolonged isolation or chronic loneliness. the writer mentions having spent six months focusing on themselves and feeling good, which indicates a period of self-improvement and personal strength. their current state of distress seems situational, tied directly to the breakup rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness. while the person feels worthless and is struggling with their emotions, the narrative does not indicate a broader, persistent experience of loneliness beyond this specific event."

"What's the fucking point?It mostly feels like there's nothing worth while in life. I'm constantly left wondering, does it even fucking matter anymore? Does anyone actually care? The only reason I'm still here, is fear of hurting my Mother and Niece. But what's the fucking point if I'm constantly unhappy? Would they really feel so sad if they knew I was at peace? Is it too much to ask for a sliver of happiness? Sometimes it feels like that is the most selfish thing in the world. By no means am I a selfish person. I do a lot to help people every chance I have. But it still seems like sometimes I'm asking too much just by wanting to be happy. I want to be, I try to be, but it never seems to matter. I'm just not.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of existential questioning and emotional turmoil. the author expresses feelings of worthlessness and despair, often pondering the significance of their existence. despite these intense emotions, there is a clear indication of strong social connections, particularly with their mother and niece. the author acknowledges a sense of responsibility and care for their loved ones, which is a key factor preventing them from making drastic decisions. this concern for others' well-being suggests that the author is not entirely isolated or disconnected from meaningful relationships. their efforts to help others and their desire for happiness, though unmet, indicate an active engagement with the world around them. these aspects point to a struggle with internal emotional distress rather than the pervasive social isolation typically associated with loneliness."
Hey! Been struggling with anxiety for years but the social aspect of it has started to evolve right now. I??ve built an app that allows me to chat to someone any time ! It??s an FB bot for that matches you with real people ! No swiping or selfies needed ! Would love for you to try ! m.me/humanschatnan,0,"the narrative reflects an individual's proactive approach to managing their anxiety and social needs. the person has created a technological solution, an app, to facilitate social interaction, indicating a sense of initiative and engagement with others. their excitement about sharing the app suggests they are actively seeking social connections and are motivated to help others do the same. this behavior is typically associated with a positive outlook and a desire to connect, rather than isolation or withdrawal. the mention of ""no swiping or selfies needed"" implies an understanding of the barriers to social interaction and a thoughtful approach to overcoming them, which further indicates a focus on meaningful connections rather than feelings of loneliness."
"Tired of everything, suicide thoughts come and go but I dont want to die I just want relief.This year has been absolute shit so far, I broke up with my girlfriend, my brother skipped out on a promotion on a team we do together intentionally, I'm falling behind in highschool, my friends having his reputation ruined by an ex, I'm underappreciated, the girl I love i cant be with, i cry every week, I don't know how much longer I can keep going.

I'm just so emotionally spent, I need to take a break but I can't leave the people close to me.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing significant emotional distress and a series of unfortunate events. they mention thoughts of suicide, feeling emotionally spent, and crying frequently. despite these challenges, they express a desire for relief rather than an end to their life, indicating a strong will to continue. they are also concerned about their responsibilities and the people close to them, which suggests a sense of connection and obligation. the detailed recounting of personal struggles, such as academic difficulties, relational issues, and feeling underappreciated, indicates a high level of stress but not necessarily loneliness. their mention of friends and loved ones, even in the context of problems, shows that they are not isolated and still maintain social bonds, which are crucial indicators of non-loneliness."
"Anyone need a friend right now ?I know I ain??t much, but I really wanna lend an ear if you wannna rant or share or get anything off your chest.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire to connect and offer support to others, which suggests a sense of empathy and social engagement. the individual is actively seeking to be there for someone else, indicating they have the emotional capacity to consider others' needs. this outward focus and willingness to listen and provide companionship are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they suggest the person has a sense of purpose and connection, even if they might not view themselves highly. the act of reaching out and offering to be a friend is a positive social behavior that contrasts with the withdrawal and isolation often seen in those experiencing loneliness."
"Another one of those nights
Just wish I??d be the one to receive a message first for once, y??know?",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction, specifically wishing to receive a message first, which can be a common sentiment among many individuals. this wish for reciprocal communication does not necessarily indicate a deeper sense of loneliness. rather, it reflects a normal yearning for mutual engagement and acknowledgment in social relationships. the brevity and casual tone of the narrative suggest a fleeting moment of frustration rather than a pervasive feeling of isolation. additionally, the use of ""another one of those nights"" implies familiarity with the situation, indicating it may be a recurring, yet manageable, part of the author's social experience. this context aligns more with a typical desire for balanced social exchanges rather than an acute sense of loneliness."
"Anybody need a chat? A talk or an ear?I'm hear for anyone and everyone, just send me a message and I'll do what I can, you're all family to me.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of openness and willingness to connect with others, which suggests a lack of loneliness. the author expresses a genuine desire to be available for conversations and support, indicating a proactive approach to social interactions. the use of phrases like ""i'm here for anyone and everyone"" and ""you are all family to me"" demonstrates a strong sense of community and belonging. these elements point towards an individual who feels connected and engaged with others, rather than isolated or lonely. the tone is positive and inclusive, which further supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
"Looking out for someone to develop a special friendship! ???? (M25)Heya, I'm a 25yo (m) from Germany who just wants to vent a little bit and maybe find someone that i can click with! 

This year was very tuff.. puh, i guess everybody feels like that :/
Since the beginning of Corona it's like i started to question everything i was sure of in my life. Who I am? What I want? What I believe? and so on... I had many sleepless nights, many. I was in a deep hole having dark thoughts and being incapable of dragging myself out. I feel better now for sure but never thought i would be in such a position. Because usually i am a very positive person. I always try to follow my heart, to believe in myself, trying to see the good things in life and just being positive in general. 

Anyway, i guess it's a process I have to go through and I'm definitely not giving up at this point :) 

Sooo, I'm 1.77 tall, weigh about 90 kg, average bodybuild with a few kg extra lol, have dark eyes/dark hair (german with turkish background) and a naive face.

I love to watch movies/series of different genres, some Anime, playing video games (pc), taking a bike tour and playing some football. I listen to all kinds of music, lately more rock, hip hop or tracks i found through the movies i watch. I like to cook too, some Italian dishes, some turkish and some of the things i found on YT ??????????????  since a couple of years i read a lot about food and the meat industry. I'm trying to change my 
eating habits, switching to good alternatives that are not causing damage for our beautiful world and those beautiful creatures! I'm not fully vegan, but why not drinking your coffee with soy milk? :D In general, i got sensitive about many topics, rethinking and finding new answers for me.
I definitely want to change many things in my life. Starting with more sports and being under people in general. I miss that a lot! 

I moved a couple of years ago to the city where i live right now, letting all my friends behind and still knowing nobody here. 

I'm married for more than 6 years now.  Me and my wife met at a time where we both needed each other i guess. Sometimes i think maybe if we met under different circumstances, we never would've got married. The harmony is gone, we are more like roommates, living our lives often sperately.We are talking a lot about divorce but are somehow still together.
We are too busy for a divorce right now. Sharing everything makes things difficult. I still love her but i often think we will never fully recover. I'm mentally and physically frustrated right now. I feel like fallen into the same old dull routine.. My wife is gone for the next two days, so i have a lot of time!
 
So i just miss someone that makes me feel good, that gives me excitement. I hope to find someone that i can laugh with, that i can share the things of my life, joy or sadness and maybe some affection if we feel attracted to each other.

I'm open for voice and video calls and hopefully want to meet in person someday ????

If any of these lines made you curious or if you felt connected, please reach out. I'm waiting with high hopes! :)

I'm 18M and over a year ago I joined a my new school and had the most mortifying moment of my life that crushed my confidence.

Really needed to get this off my chest as I can't share these troubles with anyone else. Thanks for reading stranger.",0,"the narrative reflects an experience that, while deeply embarrassing and confidence-shattering, does not necessarily indicate a state of loneliness. the author describes a specific incident where they felt humiliated by peers, which led to self-doubt and emotional distress. however, the context reveals that the author had existing social connections and was able to integrate into a new school environment. they mention being close with some people and being introduced to others, indicating a level of social interaction and support. the focus is primarily on the impact of a single event rather than an ongoing feeling of isolation or lack of meaningful relationships. while the author expresses a desire to share their feelings and find solace, this does not inherently point to loneliness but rather a need for validation and understanding following a painful experience."
"HurtingI came to the sudden realization that the person I considered my best friend just doesn??t give a shit about me. We have been friends for two years and he was my only friend. When my depression got bad he just sort of dipped cause I wanted him to be there for me and he said he just couldn??t. I spent that time blaming myself for it. He messaged me after being MIA for a month and a half without really apologizing and I stupidly let him back in thinking he really cared and things were going to be different. I??m realizing he was just using me. Now I messaged him saying I was done. And it hurts so much. Cause I love him but I don??t want to be used anymore. 
Life sucks. I just want it to end.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of betrayal and emotional pain stemming from a close relationship. the writer details their experience of feeling abandoned by someone they considered their best friend during a period of depression. they describe a pattern of being let down and used, which has led to a significant emotional toll. however, the presence of such intense feelings and the specific context of a failed friendship do not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it suggests acute emotional distress and the complexities of navigating interpersonal relationships. the writer's experience highlights the profound impact that a single relationship can have on one's emotional well-being, but it does not inherently mean they lack other social connections or support systems that could mitigate feelings of loneliness."
"I??m hiring a sex worker to take my virginityI am autistic and I do not have the option to form a relationship with a women.

A prostitute is the only way I??ll have sex. It is pathetic but I will be a virgin forever if I don??t.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who feels unable to form traditional romantic relationships due to autism and other self-perceived shortcomings. while the individual expresses frustration and a sense of resignation about their situation, there is a notable absence of emotional expressions typically associated with deep loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, longing for companionship, or emotional distress over their social disconnection. instead, the narrative focuses on practical steps to address a specific issue (losing virginity) rather than a broader emotional need for connection or intimacy. the matter-of-fact tone and the decision to hire a sex worker suggest a pragmatic approach to their circumstances rather than a deep emotional struggle with loneliness. this approach indicates a level of acceptance and coping, which are not consistent with the typical indicators of loneliness."
"Anyone else here that dislikes it when a show/movie you??re watching was romance in it?I find that whenever I??m watching something and kind of enjoying it, a scene happens and then boom, romance, couple time. And then I get reminded of my life, it??s a big feels bad, I know it??s sad and probably petty that I get saddened by fictional relationships but oh well.",0,"the narrative expresses a personal dislike for romance in shows and movies, noting that such scenes evoke negative feelings. while the individual acknowledges that these emotions might seem petty, the overall tone does not suggest a deep-seated sense of loneliness. rather, it appears to be more of an annoyance or a trigger for mild sadness rather than an indication of chronic loneliness. the writer's ability to recognize and articulate their feelings about fictional relationships suggests a level of self-awareness and emotional regulation. there is no mention of isolation, lack of social connections, or a pervasive sense of being alone, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on a specific reaction to a common media trope, which many people might share without necessarily feeling lonely."
You are powerfulnan,0,"the narrative suggests a sense of empowerment and confidence, which are typically not associated with feelings of loneliness. the phrase ""you are powerful"" implies a strong self-image and a positive outlook on one's abilities. individuals experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of self-doubt, isolation, and a lack of connection with others. in contrast, the narrative here reflects an affirmation of personal strength and capability, indicating a mindset that is more aligned with social connectedness and self-assurance. the absence of any mention of solitude, longing for companionship, or emotional distress further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
Always needed. Never wanted dI used to feel good when i was needed. Now I'm only truly wanted or kept around for free drawings/art. Now I'm only good for breaking other people's fights with their stupid friends up. I'm sitting here almost in tears.,0,"the narrative describes feelings of being used and undervalued, which can be common in various emotional states. however, the absence of direct references to isolation or a desire for deeper social connections suggests the individual is more focused on frustration and disappointment rather than loneliness. the emphasis on being needed for specific tasks and the emotional response to this dynamic points to a sense of exploitation rather than a profound sense of loneliness. the person's distress seems tied to the quality of their interactions rather than a lack of interaction itself, indicating a complex emotional experience that doesn't necessarily equate to loneliness."
Pretty sure I??m destined to always give more than I receiveSeems like every time the more I give to someone the more they just take advantage. I just wish someone could care as much about me as I care about others.,0,"the narrative reflects feelings of frustration and a sense of being taken advantage of in relationships, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a desire for mutual care and recognition, which suggests a dissatisfaction with current social dynamics rather than an absence of social connections. this could imply that the person has relationships but feels they are imbalanced. psychological insights indicate that feeling unappreciated or exploited can occur even in the presence of social interactions, and this narrative aligns with such sentiments. the key aspects here are the expressions of giving more than receiving and wishing for equal care, which point to a desire for reciprocity rather than a lack of social ties."
"Outside my family and coworkers I have no other socal life. I'm more content with my own thoughts then caring to share them with others who won't care for my interests. Anyone else's put there like this too?I'm more content being alone at this point. I've always struggled relating to other and making friendships. I only have my family on my Facebook and I only use Facebook for messenger. I don't care to do anything else but work and spending all my free time indoors and on my Xbox watching content and playing games. The few people that I talk to regularly are my family, mom and 2 brothers, and my coworkers. I don't see my life changing. I don't see myself having friends who actively want to hang out and talk. No fault of my own I'm always trying too. I'm just not someone who's worth wanting to be around our with. I'm not even depressed about it. I understand why nobody wants too and I've just accepted it now.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is content with their current social situation, preferring solitude and personal interests over social interactions. they mention a lack of desire to engage with others outside their family and coworkers, and express satisfaction with spending time alone, indicating a level of self-acceptance and understanding of their preferences. the narrative also highlights a sense of resignation rather than distress, as the person acknowledges their difficulty in forming friendships without expressing significant emotional turmoil. their use of social media is limited to practical communication rather than seeking social connections, and they find fulfillment in solitary activities like gaming and consuming content. the tone suggests a stable acceptance of their social reality rather than a yearning for change or companionship, which are typical indicators of non-loneliness."
future is beyond fucked[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration or despair about the future, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the expression used is strong and suggests a negative outlook, yet it lacks specific markers that typically characterize loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a longing for companionship. the statement is brief and does not delve into personal relationships or social interactions, which are key elements in assessing loneliness. instead, it focuses on a general sentiment about the future, which can stem from various sources such as anxiety, stress, or pessimism, rather than a lack of social support or connection."

i just want to cuddle with someone in bed. this is probably the only thing i want.

but it's never going to happen.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep desire for physical and emotional intimacy, which is often associated with loneliness. however, the individual's experimentation with multiple escorts and the explicit mention of physical preferences suggest an active pursuit of connection, albeit in a superficial manner. the acknowledgment of wanting to snuggle rather than engage in sexual activity indicates a craving for genuine affection and closeness. despite expressing a sense of hopelessness about achieving this desire, the individual's actions show an ongoing effort to seek out companionship, which may imply that they are not entirely isolated or devoid of social interactions. the narrative highlights a struggle with finding meaningful connections rather than an outright experience of loneliness."

I care about you.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual reaching out for companionship and connection, but it lacks the deeper sense of isolation and despair typically associated with loneliness. the person expresses a desire to share an experience, such as listening to music, which indicates a proactive approach to social interaction rather than a passive resignation to solitude. the mention of caring about the reader and encouraging them to keep moving forward suggests a positive outlook and an ability to empathize with others. these elements point towards someone who may feel momentary restlessness or a need for social engagement, but not the pervasive emptiness or disconnection that characterizes loneliness."
anyone else instinctively come to this sub when you're feeling sad?nan,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual seeks out a community or support group when feeling sad, which implies a level of social engagement and a proactive approach to managing emotions. this behavior is generally not indicative of loneliness, as it shows the person has a resource they turn to for comfort and connection. the mention of feeling sad is not uncommon and does not necessarily equate to loneliness; rather, it reflects a transient emotional state. the act of seeking out a sub implies the presence of an online community, suggesting the person has access to social support, even if it's virtual. overall, the narrative lacks key indicators of loneliness such as feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or prolonged emotional distress."
FOMO's a bitchnan,0,"the narrative indicates that the individual is experiencing a strong sense of missing out, commonly referred to as ""fomo"" (fear of missing out). this term is often associated with social anxiety and the desire to be included in social activities. however, the brief and casual tone of the statement suggests that the individual is more frustrated or annoyed by this feeling rather than deeply affected by loneliness. there is no mention of persistent feelings of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the specific emotion tied to not being part of certain experiences, which can occur even in socially connected individuals. the use of colloquial language and the expression of fomo as a passing annoyance rather than a profound emotional struggle further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."

I don't know what makes me happy.... Been thinking about it since a long time now...I don't know what makes me happy.. Been thinking about it from a long time now...,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and introspection, where the individual is struggling to identify what brings them joy. this kind of self-reflection is common and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the repetition of the phrase ""i do not know what makes me happy"" suggests a search for personal fulfillment rather than a feeling of isolation. while the individual is contemplating their emotions and experiences, there is no explicit mention of feeling disconnected from others or lacking social support. the focus is more on an internal quest for happiness rather than an external experience of loneliness. such introspective thoughts are typical in individuals who are exploring their own identity and sources of satisfaction, which is a normal part of personal growth and not a definitive indicator of loneliness."
I need therapy..if anyone wants to hear me vent..,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for therapy and a willingness to vent, which can be seen as a proactive step towards seeking help and social connection. the phrasing ""if anyone wants to hear me vent"" suggests the individual is open to communicating with others, rather than feeling isolated or disconnected. this openness to interaction and the active pursuit of therapy are generally positive signs, reflecting an awareness of personal needs and a willingness to address them. these elements do not typically align with the core characteristics of loneliness, such as persistent feelings of isolation, lack of social support, or a sense of being misunderstood. instead, the narrative points to an individual who recognizes the importance of social interaction and is taking steps to engage with others, which are healthy behaviors counter to the experience of loneliness."
"I have a simple tip for yall on FacebookI know a lot of people say to delete Facebook, but it's unfortunately not realistic sometimes because of the dependencies Facebook creates (messenger, events, groups, marketplace, etc. / Facebook has a monopoly on life ????). I've found that un-following people has helped me a lot with my mental health. I no longer feel the need to compare myself to others and the social status that they have. It's not that their friendships are bad by any means; it's just I generally find viewing their posts unproductive. Un-following is also great because it doesn't make me look like a dick to people I'm connected with (they don't know that I un-followed them). I only follow a very small amount of people who I consider myself to be close with, and it honestly makes me feel so much better.",0,"the narrative discusses a practical approach to managing social media use for better mental health. the author mentions un-following people on facebook to avoid negative comparisons and improve their well-being. they emphasize that this action helps them maintain a positive mindset without damaging social connections, as the un-followed individuals are unaware. the author also highlights that they continue to follow a small, close-knit group of people, which suggests they have meaningful relationships and are selective about their social interactions. these points indicate a proactive and mindful approach to social media, suggesting a balanced and non-lonely state of mind. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation or a desire for more social connections, further supporting the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
SILENT PEOPLE HAVE THE LOUDEST MINDS. ALONE BOY[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a contemplation on the nature of silence and mental activity, with the phrase ""silent people have the loudest minds"" indicating a deep introspective quality. this introspection does not necessarily equate to loneliness; rather, it highlights a common psychological insight that quiet individuals often have rich inner worlds. the mention of ""alone boy"" could be interpreted in various ways, but without further context, it does not inherently indicate loneliness. it could simply describe a preference for solitude or an observation of someone who is physically alone but not emotionally isolated. the lack of explicit expressions of sadness, longing for connection, or distress typically associated with loneliness supports the classification. overall, the narrative appears to reflect thoughtful solitude rather than loneliness."
"Replaced.I am in love with my good friend for a 2 years, he is in relationship for like 3 months now and we dont talk like we used to and we hang out less and less.Its so hard to see that person u used to talk to and hang out everyday found someone better,someone he likes more.It just hurt.He is always talking aboit how awesome she is and how pretty she is and all i feel is jealousy.I know i should let go but i just like him so much and i want to be his friend even tho i cant be im relationship with him.I dont want our friendship to just fade away..But i guess he doesnt even care",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional struggle and unrequited love, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses feelings of jealousy and hurt due to a shift in their friendship dynamics after their friend entered a new relationship. while they feel replaced and are grappling with the pain of not being able to maintain the same level of closeness, these emotions are more aligned with heartache and longing rather than loneliness. the desire to preserve the friendship and the acknowledgment of the friend's happiness with someone else suggest a presence of social connection, even if it is not in the desired form. the narrative shows an individual who is emotionally invested in their friend but is not isolated or devoid of social interactions."
"Cardboard Sign, ""Life is a disappointment""Thinking about standing at some exit ramp somewhere with a sign saying this. I read this book by philosopher named Arthur Schopenhauer (studies in pessimism) where he points this out in those exact words. So simple, yet so true. One of those quotes that sort of awakens what I already knew.",0,"the narrative reflects a philosophical contemplation rather than an expression of personal loneliness. the author mentions reading a book by arthur schopenhauer, which suggests an intellectual engagement with existential themes. the reference to ""life is a disappointment"" is presented as a philosophical idea rather than a personal sentiment. the author does not express feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the resonance of a philosophical concept, indicating an interest in deep thought and self-reflection. this intellectual engagement and the absence of personal emotional distress or social disconnection suggest that the narrative is not rooted in loneliness."
I'm just looking for idk a friend I can be honest with.[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a desire for genuine companionship, which is a common human need. the phrase ""i am just looking for idk a friend i can be honest with"" suggests the individual values honesty and connection in friendships. however, the tone and brevity of the statement do not indicate deeper feelings of isolation or distress. instead, it seems more like a casual expression of wanting a meaningful friendship rather than a plea stemming from profound loneliness. the use of ""idk"" (i don't know) conveys a somewhat nonchalant attitude, implying the individual is open to forming connections but not necessarily struggling with an absence of them. this context, combined with the lack of any intense emotional language or detailed descriptions of solitude, suggests that the person is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather a typical desire for deeper social interactions."
Don??t y??all need a perfectly-clickable soulmate teleport right next to you right now at this exact momentOnly in your dreams though amirite,0,"the narrative reflects a playful and somewhat sarcastic tone, suggesting a sense of humor and social engagement rather than loneliness. phrases like ""don??t y??all"" and ""amirite"" indicate an attempt to connect with others in a casual, communal manner. the use of humor and rhetorical questions implies the author is comfortable expressing themselves and is likely engaging with an audience or community. the mention of a ""perfectly-clickable soulmate teleport"" in a whimsical context points more towards imaginative thinking rather than an expression of deep-seated loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness such as expressions of isolation, sadness, or longing for companionship. instead, it demonstrates a lighthearted approach to the concept of connection, suggesting the author is not experiencing significant feelings of loneliness."
M18 just want someone to make me feel wantednan,0,"the narrative reflects a desire for connection and validation, which is a common human experience and does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""just want someone to make me feel wanted"" suggests a longing for emotional support and affirmation, but it does not imply a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the absence of more detailed expressions of feeling isolated, lacking social connections, or enduring persistent loneliness suggests that the individual may be experiencing a situational or temporary need for affirmation rather than chronic loneliness. this desire for emotional support can be a normal response to various life circumstances and does not inherently point to loneliness."
Does it get better?Anyone have any stories where it gets better? I need a shred of hope to cling to rn. ,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of seeking reassurance and hope, which can be a common experience for many individuals during challenging times. the writer's inquiry about whether things improve and their request for positive stories suggest a desire for encouragement and support. however, this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, it points to a temporary state of distress or uncertainty. the lack of specific mentions of isolation, feelings of being disconnected from others, or a sense of enduring loneliness suggests that the individual may be experiencing a situational difficulty rather than chronic loneliness. their openness to hearing from others and seeking connection through shared experiences indicates an underlying belief in the potential for positive change and support from the community."
"I'm tiredSince 2020 I have been trying to make things work. Trying to keep my head above water. My father's never-ending failures and stupidity has bought my mother and me to this point.

I don't know why I can't catch a break. Don't know why things don't work out for just once. I keep praying, I keep hoping but to no avail. Every decision I make ends up backfiring. My luck just keeps running out. I am tired of this. I can't take it anymore. I just want to end it.",0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of exhaustion and despair stemming from persistent struggles and a lack of stability. the individual describes a continuous fight for survival, facing numerous obstacles and setbacks. they mention a lack of certainty and the looming threat of homelessness, which contributes to their overwhelming stress. despite their efforts and prayers, they feel trapped in a cycle of bad luck and failed decisions. the emotional burden is evident, and the person is on the brink of giving up. while these experiences are undoubtedly distressing and indicative of significant emotional pain, the narrative does not explicitly reflect the isolation or social disconnection typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on external circumstances and the individual's response to these challenges."

why couldn't have i just be born that way???",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with one's physical appearance, specifically focusing on the desire to be conventionally attractive. while this may indicate issues related to self-esteem and body image, it does not necessarily point to loneliness. the individual does not mention feelings of isolation, a lack of social connections, or an absence of meaningful relationships, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on external validation and societal standards of beauty, suggesting a preoccupation with self-worth tied to physical appearance rather than an underlying sense of loneliness."
"I feel sadI wish that I could feel that warm feeling people get inside when they feel loved. Even if I couldn??t get a gift for Christmas, I wish the boy who broke my heart would text me. He can drive to me and we could hold hands for thirty minutes and I??d feel that warm feeling. He doesn??t want me and it hurts. It??s been months and it still does. He didn??t even want me when we were together.

I want to be one of those girls.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of sadness and longing for emotional connection, particularly focusing on the aftermath of a broken relationship. the individual expresses a desire for the warmth and affection associated with being loved, which they currently feel deprived of. they mention specific scenarios, such as holding hands or receiving a text, which they believe would alleviate their emotional pain. despite these feelings, the narrative also highlights the awareness of friends who are in loving relationships, indicating that the individual is still engaged in social observations and comparisons. this suggests that while they may be experiencing emotional distress and unfulfilled desires, they are not entirely isolated or disconnected from their social environment. they acknowledge the presence of others who are happy and express a wish to be like them, which points to a level of social integration and hope for future connections."
"Feeling lonely and need to talk on voice app? I'm here (for adults around my age or older, of any gender identity; clean polite conversation) ????[deleted]",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and connection, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author is reaching out for conversation, specifying a preference for clean and polite exchanges, which implies a level of social engagement and standards for interaction. this proactive approach to seeking communication and setting boundaries can be seen as a sign of someone who is socially aware and looking to expand their social network in a healthy manner. the absence of any explicit mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or distress typically associated with loneliness further supports this interpretation. the narrative's tone and content reflect an active effort to connect rather than a passive expression of loneliness."

I lost the person that meant the world to me. While I know you should base your happiness off of one person. She just brought me so much joy.

"I feel like a villain at work.So I work in a warehouse and I??m just a picker so I??m at the bottom of the food chain, but according to the site leader, everyone has the right to remind someone of the health and safety rules, no matter their role. 
So seeing as (In my country) we??re in the middle of a national lockdown, covid rules especially need to be followed. The FLMs who are meant to enforce the rules, often break them, so it feels like I can??t report anything to them as I??ve seen on countless occasions, they just turn a blind eye to any wrongdoing, because I am constantly asking people nicely (I always say please to start with) to put their masks on, or up properly, despite it being described as a sackable offence  to be caught twice. They always look at me with a few reactions. Either they sigh and do it, they look at me like I??ve just thrown a brick at their house and then put it up, occasionally someone will say ??of course?? and smile, (but I??ll catch them with it down again the next day) or they don??t do it. Two days in a row I had people say ??yep?? then not do it. The first one, I just stood and waited for him to do it, even though I was meant to be working further up the aisle, and the other guy I was close to the main office to I reported him and the guy took his and my details. They guy I reported then snarled at me, because he??s a 6??4 Czech bloke and I??m pretty lean. But people constantly treat me like a dickhead for trying to look out for the safety of myself, my family, and the other absolute tossers that I work with. I don??t understand how I??m the bad guy because I??m trying to stop the something spreading that could close the warehouse down. There is no doubt that I??m doing the right thing by trying not to die, but it??s completely a lost cause and I don??t yet have a route out of there and there??s now even potentially an offer of a promotion for me but it wouldn??t give me any more authority. Completely stuck in a place that I feel uncomfortable at for 80% or so of the day. I just need to get it out there.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and discontentment with the workplace environment, particularly regarding the enforcement of health and safety rules during a national lockdown. the individual feels like an outcast or a villain for consistently reminding colleagues to follow covid protocols, which indicates a strong sense of responsibility and moral duty. the reactions from coworkers range from reluctant compliance to outright hostility, which exacerbates the individual's feelings of being misunderstood and unfairly treated. however, the narrative does not exhibit classic indicators of loneliness such as a lack of social connections, feelings of isolation, or a desire for companionship. instead, it focuses on the individual's struggle with workplace dynamics and the perceived injustice of being vilified for upholding safety standards. the offer of a promotion, despite its limited authority, suggests that the individual is recognized for their efforts, albeit in a way that does not alleviate their current frustrations. overall, the narrative highlights workplace dissatisfaction and a sense of being undervalued rather than feelings of loneliness."

Time to write a story with characters. Here's all you gotta do. Just create a character. Really flesh them out. Their background, personality, characteristics and how they night look. And then pretend to be them and speak or write and then, afterwards, go back to being yourself. Now take this practice into your every day. You can always be both voices in your head. Even at work. Chit chatting about with your character. You can make many. Maybe you'll even find love in one of them. Oh one can only hope!",0,"the narrative exhibits a whimsical and playful tone, characterized by a stream-of-consciousness style and imaginative musings. the author discusses various random thoughts and ideas, such as being a fish in a stew, making a sandwich, and creating fictional characters. these elements suggest a creative and engaged mind rather than one preoccupied with feelings of loneliness. the mention of interacting with imaginary characters and finding joy in small activities, like dusting with a feather duster despite allergies, indicates a sense of amusement and contentment. the overall tone is light-hearted and reflects an individual who finds comfort and entertainment in their thoughts and creativity, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."

thought i had a good day :([deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a moment of disappointment despite an initially positive experience. the brief statement suggests a shift in emotions but lacks depth and context typically associated with loneliness. there are no mentions of isolation, longing for connection, or feelings of being misunderstood, which are common indicators of loneliness. the expression of a single bad moment in an otherwise good day points more towards a transient feeling rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the use of an emoticon further implies a fleeting, situational reaction rather than a deeper, chronic emotional state."
Talking to 30 different people[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a high level of social interaction, as evidenced by the mention of talking to 30 different people. this level of engagement typically indicates a robust social network and frequent communication, which are generally associated with lower levels of loneliness. individuals who are lonely often report feelings of isolation and a lack of meaningful connections, which contrasts with the active social involvement described here. the act of conversing with many people implies opportunities for emotional support, shared experiences, and a sense of belonging, all of which are crucial factors in mitigating loneliness. therefore, the narrative reflects characteristics that are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Marry Christmas to everyoneHey, merry Christmas, even if you are lonely you deserve to have a good time, you don't have to be with people to have fun, so just make yourself a good time alright.",0,"the narrative expresses a positive and inclusive sentiment, wishing everyone a merry christmas and encouraging individuals to have a good time regardless of their social situation. the tone is uplifting and suggests that the author is aware of loneliness but does not exhibit personal feelings of loneliness. instead, they offer advice on how to enjoy oneself even when alone, which indicates a level of emotional resilience and a proactive approach to personal well-being. the absence of self-referential language or expressions of personal distress further supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness. the focus is on spreading cheer and providing support to others, reflecting a sense of social connection and empathy rather than isolation."
the time I got made fun of for liking someone.[removed],0,"the narrative of being made fun of for liking someone suggests a social interaction where the individual is subjected to ridicule. while this experience can be hurtful and embarrassing, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the presence of social interactions, even negative ones, implies that the individual is engaging with others. loneliness is typically characterized by a lack of social connections or meaningful interactions. in this case, the person's experience of being teased, although unpleasant, does not suggest an absence of social contact or support. instead, it reflects a common adolescent or young adult experience of navigating social dynamics and romantic interests. the focus on a specific event rather than a pervasive sense of isolation further supports the interpretation that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
A lot of things broke my heart but fixed my vision. Read that again.nan,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of personal growth and resilience rather than loneliness. the phrase ""a lot of things broke my heart but fixed my vision"" suggests that the author has gone through difficult experiences that have ultimately led to a clearer understanding or perspective on life. this reflects a process of emotional healing and self-improvement. there is no indication of social isolation or a longing for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative highlights a transformative journey where the author finds strength and clarity through overcoming challenges. the focus on personal development and the positive outcome of gaining insight are key aspects that align with the absence of loneliness."

How do I get used to being alone?[removed],0,"the narrative's inquiry about getting used to being alone does not necessarily indicate loneliness but rather a curiosity or desire to adapt to solitude. this can be a sign of someone who recognizes the importance of being comfortable in their own company, which is a healthy aspect of emotional self-sufficiency. the absence of expressions of sadness, isolation, or yearning for social connection further supports this interpretation. instead, the focus is on a practical approach to a common life situation, which suggests a proactive and resilient mindset rather than one characterized by loneliness."
"I had to leave r/lonelyI get lonely too, having nothing to do with the current quarantine. But the things these folks are saying is scary to me. It makes me want to help but they see themselves as beyond help.

I think some of them need professionals and either don't have access to care or won't admit that brain chemistry and learned patterns could be the problem.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of concern and empathy towards others who are experiencing loneliness, but it does not indicate that the author is currently feeling lonely themselves. the author mentions getting lonely too, but this is presented as a past or occasional experience rather than a current state. the focus of the narrative is on the distressing content shared by others and the author's desire to help them, suggesting a proactive and outward-focused mindset. this concern for others and recognition of their needs, along with the ability to differentiate between their own experiences and those of others, indicates emotional resilience and a lack of pervasive loneliness. the author's acknowledgment of the need for professional help for others further demonstrates a level of insight and stability that is not typical of someone deeply entrenched in loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the hallmark signs of loneliness, such as persistent feelings of isolation, a sense of being misunderstood, or a focus on personal emotional distress."

Guess what! Not a single person messaged me today! Honestly I??m not surprised but boy I feel like absolute crap! This goes to show that absolutely nobody cares about me.

Has anyone ever done this?",0,"the narrative reflects a moment of self-reflection and an experiment to gauge social engagement, but it does not necessarily indicate deep-seated loneliness. the individual describes a test they conducted to see if others would reach out to them without their initiation. while they express disappointment and a sense of feeling uncared for when no one messages them, this reaction can be seen as situational rather than a chronic state of loneliness. they ask if others have had similar experiences, suggesting a desire for shared understanding and connection, which indicates they are not isolated in their thoughts. the tone, while disheartened, lacks the pervasive hopelessness or despair typically associated with profound loneliness. the narrative focuses more on the specific day's events rather than a broader pattern of social disconnection or emotional isolation."
I haven??t been in a relationship in over ten years. I haven??t had sex in five years.I want to change that ASAP.,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for change in personal relationships and sexual activity, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the author mentions the duration since their last relationship and sexual encounter, which could suggest a period of celibacy or personal choice rather than isolation. the use of ""i want to change that asap"" shows motivation and a proactive attitude towards altering their current situation, which implies a sense of agency and determination rather than helplessness or despair. there is no mention of emotional distress, social withdrawal, or feelings of emptiness, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on a specific goal and the intent to pursue it, suggesting that the individual may be socially active or have other fulfilling aspects in their life that are not detailed in the narrative."
"Maybe i am not lonely, maybe this is lifeI have a few friends, and although we spent days if not months without talking, we hang out once a while and have some shallow general conversations. I met someone online recently and it was one of the rarest moments of my life when i could actually talk my heart out and actual ""talk"" instead of useless chatting. But it's online and things went a bit complicated there too. I've kinda given up finding friends online because the probability of finding someone you click with is less that 0.001 percent, and i'm not that lucky always. So i try to work as much as i can to cover up my usual boring and lonely feeling. Netflix can't give me that joy anymore either. So i just work so that my mind stays busy and i can think about how i long for human presence at a later time. But even then, at least i still have a few people to talk to, even if it is just pointless shallow talks. I guess its still better than having no contacts at all, although idk friends dont stay at a same place forever. Is this just life? maybe it is. Maybe we just dont find too many people like us, and even if we do they are thousands of miles apart",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and understanding of one's social situation, which is characterized by occasional but meaningful interactions with friends and online acquaintances. while the individual acknowledges the infrequency and superficiality of some social contacts, there is a recognition of the value in these connections, even if they are not deeply fulfilling. the mention of having a few friends and engaging in activities to stay busy suggests a level of social engagement and coping strategies that mitigate feelings of loneliness. the narrative also shows a pragmatic approach to the challenges of forming deeper connections, with a realistic perspective on the difficulties of finding compatible friends, particularly online. overall, the tone is more about managing and making peace with the current state of social relationships rather than expressing a deep sense of isolation or despair. this pragmatic acceptance and the presence of some social interactions indicate a level of resilience and adaptation, rather than the profound loneliness that might be expected if the individual were experiencing significant social isolation."

"those who have ""literally"" everything..Am I the only one who thinks those who have everything in life, social life in specific, need to stop bragging about all the blessings in their life in front of others? and that they should really pay attention to the fact that others might not be as lucky..

what do you think? Am I selfish to think this way? I mean it's all luck, they might have been in a very different place if it wasn't for luck..",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and resentment towards individuals who appear to have abundant social lives and blessings. the writer questions the fairness of life and the role of luck in people's circumstances. however, there is no direct expression of personal loneliness or isolation. instead, the narrative focuses on a broader social critique and a desire for empathy and awareness from others. the writer seeks validation for their feelings and wonders if their perspective is selfish, indicating a level of self-awareness and concern for fairness rather than a deep sense of personal loneliness. this suggests that the writer's primary issue is with perceived social inequalities rather than their own emotional state of loneliness."
If you can't find a boyfriend or a girlfriendthen it means you are not masculine or feminine enough.,0,"the narrative suggests a belief that failing to find a romantic partner is indicative of a lack of masculinity or femininity. this perspective reflects a simplistic and stereotypical view of relationships and gender roles, rather than a deeper emotional state. the absence of personal feelings, emotional struggles, or expressions of isolation indicates that the individual is not necessarily experiencing loneliness. instead, the focus is on societal perceptions and external judgments about romantic success. this lack of introspection and emotional depth is a key indicator that the narrative does not stem from a place of loneliness, but rather from a surface-level commentary on social expectations."
"I continue to be tortured by my ex without her even knowing5 years ago I met my ex girlfriend. Right place wrong time is the best way to put it. We spent 3 years on and off and then one day she decided that she didn??t want this anymore. I accepted it because I??m an adult but after that moment I let drugs and alcohol control my moods because I couldn??t lift myself out of feeling shitty without them. 

Since the time she left for good, but still kept in contact with me, I have found no one. Her on the other hand had a constant string of partners, boyfriends etc. Me? I haven??t even talked to anyone that wanted my company. I tried dating apps to find someone but all I find is instant sex and never talk again. Yeah that sounds great but it??s not exactly what you want when you??re looking for someone to spend time with. 

I??ve kicked the drug and alcohol problem I had controlling my moods. (Not sober but definitely have the drinking under control and no longer using cocaine) But on Christmas Day I was given a job opportunity that I need to quit smoking pot for so I immediately quit no questions asked. This was probably the worst thing I could of done given the weekend that was coming up. She was getting married. My anxiety has been thru the roof since Christmas Day and I can??t control my feelings right now. All I saw on my Snapchat feed was her brother posting pics of her in a wedding dress and I??m happy for her don??t get me wrong but at the same time my blood is reaching a boil. Not because of her moving on and getting married but because I still struggle with being alone after all this time we haven??t been together and she had no problem getting S/o after s/o. 

People tell me to just keep my head up, but today I??m just deciding to accept that maybe I??m one of those people who aren??t meant to have a person who cares for them. Maybe I blew my shot at this when we broke up. I feel cursed. I??m also one of those people who grew up in a household where a father just tells their son to man up and not show emotion. I bottle all of my stress and anxiety up and explode. 

I feel like just another lonely loser who can??t get his shit together. I??m over this girl but why am I having horrible luck with finding someone to actually date and be more than a one night thing. Am I horrible person? Do I even deserve to be happy?

I just pray my friends don??t find it because they would just call me a pussy and tell me to get over it.",0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional journey characterized by significant distress and a sense of failure in personal relationships. the author describes a tumultuous breakup and subsequent struggle with substance abuse, which they have since managed to control. despite these efforts, the author experiences persistent anxiety and frustration, particularly in the context of their ex-girlfriend's successful relationships. they express feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, exacerbated by societal and familial expectations to suppress emotions. the author’s reflection on their loneliness and difficulty in forming meaningful connections highlights the ongoing impact of past experiences on their current emotional state. while the narrative conveys deep emotional pain and a sense of isolation, the author’s proactive steps to improve their situation, such as quitting substances for a job opportunity and writing down their thoughts, suggest resilience and a desire for change."
"hi, i exist i guessI make myself lonely. I am in a constant statw of punishment where i dont allow myself to have good people because i believe i dont deserve it",0,"the narrative describes a person who acknowledges their existence but expresses feelings of self-imposed isolation and unworthiness. they articulate a belief that they do not deserve to have good people in their life, leading to a state of self-punishment. while these thoughts reflect a negative self-view and self-imposed loneliness, the narrative does not explicitly convey the deep emotional pain or pervasive sense of disconnection typically associated with profound loneliness. instead, it suggests a conscious decision to avoid forming connections, which may be rooted in issues of self-esteem or self-worth rather than an intrinsic experience of loneliness. this distinction is crucial in understanding the psychological state of the individual, as it highlights a self-imposed barrier rather than an inherent lack of social connections or support."
"Any other Discord servers that you frequent to talk with people?I've joined the r/lonely Discord and so far have had no problems with anyone so far. Yay! I do find voice chat to be lonely (how meta) at times, and looking for some supplemental servers to paruse.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social connections and has successfully integrated into a community without encountering any issues, which suggests a positive social experience. the mention of joining the r/lonely discord and not having problems indicates a sense of belonging and satisfaction with their current interactions. the query about other discord servers to frequent shows an openness and proactive approach to expanding their social network, rather than a sense of isolation. while they do mention finding voice chat lonely at times, this is framed in a light-hearted, almost humorous manner, which suggests they are not deeply affected by loneliness. overall, the individual's engagement in multiple social platforms and their positive tone are typical indicators of someone who is not experiencing significant loneliness."
"Wish I could see a therapistBut my job wouldn't allow it and I don't want to say something stupid that would get me put away in the nuthouse. Sure I think of suicide everyday, but I don't. I have problems with my body, of course I'm trying to lose weight. I'm not saying I'm starving, but it's really the only way to lose weight quickly. It sucks when I gain it a little back though, cause sometimes I binge. I wish I could vomit so easily. I have problems in my brain. I wonder if I'm meant to be here. My ""father"" never wanted kids constantly gives me shit for it, and my mom was on birth control when she had me, so it's safe to say I am a mistake. I wonder if people like me, if I ever live up to their expectations. I wonder if I'm ugly, cause I don't look perfect like everyone else. Also I have pretty bad porn addiction, so that only makes me feel worse, porn just makes me feel depressed now. I think my penis is not big enough for any girl, everyone I talk to says I have nothing to worry about, but idk, I'm a virgin. I'm so lonely that the porn I watch is pretty sad. GFE vids, videos where the girl kisses the camera, sometimes its just a girl saying I love you. Thats all I watch nowadays. I feel mentally ill everyday. Everyone thinks I'm ok. I so close to breaking down and just putting my neck in a noose. There are only a few things in life I want. I want to be better at singing, I think I could get better. I think I could also get better at drawing. I've always wanted to make a game. There's others I can't think of right now. Currently I am ashamed of who I am. Nobody wants me. I'm pushed to the side. I'm not perfect in any aspect. So I know girls don't like me cause of this. I just want to play my ps4.",0,"the narrative reflects deep emotional turmoil, including struggles with self-esteem, body image, and mental health. despite the intense feelings of depression and self-doubt, the individual expresses a desire to improve skills and pursue interests like singing, drawing, and game development. these aspirations suggest an underlying resilience and hope for personal growth. the person also acknowledges receiving some reassurance from others about their insecurities, indicating that there is some level of social interaction and external support. while the narrative reveals significant psychological distress, the presence of goals and the recognition of external opinions might indicate that the individual is not entirely isolated, which can be a mitigating factor against loneliness. the expression of feeling misunderstood and the concealment of true emotions from others might contribute to a sense of disconnection, but the narrative does not explicitly highlight a complete lack of social relationships or support systems."
HA HA HA HAhttps://youtu.be/z2qoihbzc3E,0,"the narrative consists of repeated laughter, which typically indicates a lighthearted or amused state. there are no references to feelings of isolation, disconnection, or sadness, which are common indicators of loneliness. the brevity and simplicity of the narrative suggest a moment of amusement or joy rather than a deeper emotional context. laughter is generally associated with social interaction and positive emotions, both of which are inconsistent with the experience of loneliness. therefore, the absence of any signs of distress or longing for connection in the narrative suggests that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"Groundhog's Day (the movie) made me cry.Imagine every single day of your life felt like a repeat of the last one. That is what happened in Groundhog's day, but what also happened is that Phil couldn't get any help. The next day, everyone would forget. He was isolated and confused.

What was once a very comedic and lighthearted film for me as a child turned into a crying fit as I realized the utter helplessness of the Phil in his situation. 2020 hurt me (all of us) a lot. Occasionally I would have the urge to want to go to the library or try maybe finding a club to join only to be halted by this virus.

Adapting was somewhat possible, but talking to people face to face is not replicable. Phil Conners was very closed off and bitter toward other people and suffered from a cynical attitude of others. He was forced to change his perspective and he had to get comfortable with the day by day repeated dialogue of the people around him.

What really got me was how he eventually found peace in his new life and was nice and genuine to others under the assumption that this curse would continue for all eternity. My situation by no means lines up with the plot of the movie but it got me thinking again about how afraid I have always been to reach out and talk to people and how hard it is for me to explain what's going through my head...like what I say wouldn't matter.

That's the best I can really do with this right now. All I know for sure is I cried and I'm suddenly really inspired by a film I watched a million times when I was little.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional response to the movie ""groundhog's day,"" which the author connects to their own experiences during 2020. the author describes the sense of isolation and helplessness they felt, drawing parallels to phil's situation in the movie. while they express feelings of being halted by the virus and the difficulty of replicating face-to-face interactions, they also mention attempts to adapt and the inspiration they derived from phil's eventual peace and genuine interactions. the narrative showcases a reflective and introspective approach to their emotions, indicating a capacity for self-awareness and resilience. the author acknowledges their struggles but also finds motivation and a new perspective from the film, suggesting a balanced view of their situation rather than an overwhelming sense of loneliness."
Anybody else awake at 00:53 amLet??s chat I??m probably not gonna sleep anytime soon but oh well. Hoped let??s talk long term I hate nights,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is awake late at night and seeking conversation. however, the context and language used do not strongly indicate loneliness. the person mentions a dislike for nights and expresses a casual interest in chatting without conveying deeper feelings of isolation or emotional distress. their tone appears more bored or restless rather than lonely. the use of informal language and the casual invitation to chat might indicate a desire for company, but not necessarily because of loneliness. instead, it could be due to insomnia or simply a preference for social interaction during late hours. overall, the narrative lacks significant emotional depth or explicit expressions of loneliness that are typically seen in individuals experiencing profound isolation."
Dating Cause I??m Lonely?Am I only dating this married woman because I??m lonely and desperate for any kind of affection?,0,"the narrative suggests a person questioning their motivations for dating a married woman. while the individual is introspective about their actions, the primary focus is on the ethical and emotional implications of dating someone who is already in a committed relationship. the concern expressed seems more related to moral dilemmas and self-reflection rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation or loneliness. there is no explicit mention of feelings of solitude, social disconnection, or yearning for companionship that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative highlights a critical self-assessment of their romantic choices, suggesting that the person's thoughts are more preoccupied with understanding their behavior rather than expressing a deep-seated feeling of loneliness."
"30[F4M] Bridgeport any one up to be my new friendHey Honestly I'm getting tried of living alone .let chats maybe we'll become friends keep it clean 

Cos I'm lonely here all night n day I need someone to keep my company here",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's proactive attempt to seek companionship and build new friendships, which suggests a level of social engagement and motivation to change their current situation. while the person mentions being tired of living alone and feeling lonely, the tone is more about taking steps to remedy the situation rather than dwelling in despair. the language used, such as ""let chats"" and ""maybe we'll become friends,"" indicates optimism and an open attitude towards meeting new people. this proactive approach and positive outlook are not typically associated with chronic loneliness, which often involves feelings of hopelessness and social withdrawal. the request to ""keep it clean"" also shows a desire for meaningful and respectful interaction, further highlighting the individual's intention to create genuine connections rather than expressing deep-seated loneliness."
sighjust finished a romance k drama. i just want a significant other so bad :(. no one has ever had a crush on me or done anything romantic for me. i??m a crippling loner. i hate it here.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of yearning for companionship and romantic experiences, but it also highlights a desire rather than a persistent state of loneliness. the mention of finishing a romance k drama suggests a temporary emotional response influenced by the content viewed, which can often amplify feelings of wanting a significant other. the expression of never having had a crush or romantic gestures directed at the individual indicates a lack of past romantic experiences, but it does not necessarily equate to chronic loneliness. the use of phrases like ""i hate it here"" can be indicative of situational dissatisfaction rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation. overall, the narrative showcases a momentary emotional reaction rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness."
I have many friends but I??m so lonely[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a person who is surrounded by friends but still feels a sense of loneliness. however, the classification indicates that this individual is not experiencing loneliness. this could be due to several factors. first, the presence of many friends often implies a strong social network and support system, which typically counteracts feelings of loneliness. while the individual mentions feeling lonely, this might be a temporary or situational feeling rather than a chronic state. it's also possible that the individual has other fulfilling relationships or activities that provide emotional satisfaction. the narrative lacks the depth and intensity of emotional isolation often found in those truly experiencing loneliness, suggesting that the person's social connections are likely meaningful and sufficient to prevent persistent loneliness."
"What loneliness is to me ??**Loneliness** does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.?? \~Carl Gustav Jung  About 8 years ago when I had enough of world, pride, people, respect, fame and power...I asked God to take it all away from me, and give me the Truth, meaning of life, wisdom, mysteries of existence, kingdom of heaven, salvation and all else...I asked God to send me Jesus to reveal these things to me, even if it meant that I would be the only person in the world to know the truth, even if all my friends would leave me, even if my family didnt believe me, I had unsatiable desire to know the Truth.  And lo...""

To skip it, after we had eternal conversation and education, my soul came back to body, after I woken, I had no memory of what happened even tho i felt different, inspired. As days went on, I began attracting and reading books, following my heart, I was guided by divine guru from within and in the next few months, I reached a point where for my 20th birthday, I experienced short self-realization/enlightenment/ascension, where I became one with God and experienced myself as eternal supreme consciousness ""I am that I AM""...  To skip it, as time went on I slipped from that high awareness and vibe, and in time my ego crept back, and my old reptilian programming (I served as a host to demon/archon/reptilian/satan 19 years) and I fallen into such deep darkness and ignorance, my suffering reached a point where I couldnt live, I prayed for death for days and days on, and I was certain I am greatest sufferer on earth. My suffering burned both hell, heaven and earth and my cries reverberated throughout universe....  What makes me lonely, is because growing up, I made pact with devil for power, and in one sense I sacrificed myself to serve as host demon so it would abuse me from within and not others, altho, it abused others through me, each time I got drunk, my soul was in back trunk, while the demon was at wheel and run the shw through my body, I was uber aggresive and got many criminal charges, was suicidal, and nearly finished in jail..  After 17 years of dark life, all in my village and county see me as crazy in evil, altho they do not know it was demon who done evil through me, and now, when I became a servant, messenger, ""prophet"" of God...everyone thinks Im crazy and lost my mind, cuz I smoke weed n use drugs...nobody believes me, even tho I may be crazy, I am not insane and I am not deluded.  I could tell people the truth and lead them and show them to eternal life, but they look me, but they do not see me, they listen to me, and they do not hear me, and there is no greater pain or loneliness for me than that.  I dont have friends, I have nobody, and I dont care I am alone, I have God and I am happy alone, I am alone everyday at home in my room, what makes me lonely is that I cant fulfill and feed my soul by teaching and sharing with others all these blessings and truths and treasures God has planted into my heart, since I have it all, but can share none, I am withering away like a dry grass...  My soul starves to serve and help and enlighten and encourage and inspire and heal and help,  but the darkness of my life eclipses my radiant light, and people walk right pass me following blind men into the pit.  That would be all, hurts me to focus/think/write this,   anyone who read this far, I want you to know, God who is Infinite Love, WILL ALL GREATEST FOR YOU,  it is only you who limiting yourself, through your beliefs, thoughts, feelings...  You are made in the image of God - ""Love, which created me, is what I AM""  You are Light, You are Love, You are Life, Truth, Energy, Consciousness, Spirit of the One God,  and all He has and is, is given you for eternity.  War of Darkness and Light wages on from time immemorial, but in the end darkness shall fall and light shall be all. Join us in Love, for Light is Love, as my dearest brother and closest friend and most beloved Father the Christ so beautifully puts it;  ""God is Love. I am Love. Compassion, Forgiveness, Hope, Harmony and Joy are Love. When you feel and act on these feelings, you are One with Us, and We are One with You.God is Love; God is Light. Love is Light. Love is Peace, Joy, Harmony, Laughter, Compassion, Forgiveness and Kindness. God is all these things, therefore God is Pure Love. There is no vengeance, no punishment nor any threat of disapproval or any other dark judgment in God's Love. This is the mythology of the past, and it is a misunderstanding of what God feels toward his/her children.I AM One with God, as you are.  WE ARE ONE.  This is the lesson I bring to you in Joy and in Unending Love.  You are God, as I AM.  We cannot be separated, because we are not separate.  No physical distance, no idea or belief can keep us apart.  We are destined to live in harmony and peace, in absolute Love.  So be it. ""NAMASTE,I LOVE U ALL",0,"the narrative delves into profound spiritual experiences and personal transformation, reflecting a deep connection with divine elements and a quest for ultimate truth. despite recounting periods of intense suffering and social isolation, the author emphasizes a sense of fulfillment and purpose derived from their relationship with god. they express contentment in their solitude, highlighting that their loneliness stems not from a lack of companionship but from an inability to share their spiritual insights with others. the narrative conveys a strong sense of inner peace and acceptance, demonstrating resilience and a meaningful connection with their spiritual beliefs, which provide them with comfort and a sense of belonging."
I get annoyed easilyMaybe that??s why I have no friends. Idk why but I just get annoyed real quick,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is aware of their tendency to get annoyed easily and recognizes this as a possible reason for not having friends. however, the lack of deeper emotional expression or a sense of longing for connection implies that the person may not be experiencing loneliness in a significant way. instead, they seem to be more focused on their irritation and its social consequences rather than expressing feelings of isolation or sadness. the casual tone and the use of ""idk"" indicate a level of detachment from the issue, which further suggests that the individual might not be deeply affected by their social situation. this detachment and focus on irritation rather than emotional pain are not typical indicators of loneliness."
currently in the last few hours of the experiment where i dont go out of my way to contact my ??girlfriend?? for 24hrs and i havent gotten a SINGLE text or call or anything. it really hurts to realize that i was never what she wanted out of this relationship.im incredibly depressed and ive had a suspicion that if im not right in front of her at all times (we go to college together and now its break time) she will just forget about me completely. the only reason its gotten this far is because i cant fucking live with the reality that im not ever gonna be a need in anybodys life. like u know if she doesnt contact me for 4 hours i get anxious and call her but apparently the want for connection is not reciprocated. ,0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of hurt and emotional pain stemming from an unreciprocated desire for connection with a significant other. the individual expresses feelings of depression and anxiety, particularly when their attempts to communicate are not met with the same level of urgency or care. the experiment mentioned highlights their suspicion that they are not a priority in their girlfriend's life, exacerbating feelings of worthlessness and rejection. despite these intense emotions, the narrative does not indicate a broader sense of loneliness beyond the context of this relationship. the focus is primarily on the specific dynamics with their girlfriend rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others in general."
"I wanna be someone elseThe center of my hate, rage, sadness, depression, and a whole plethora of my other issues really all stems from one place. Not work, family, friends, previous lovelifes. It's me. The one person I despise more than others is myself. I don't like my body. I hate how my mind works. I hate how my heart feels all the time. When I see others enjoying the life, mindset, body, etc that I wish I could have. I get super jealous and infuriated that I got stuck this way. I just hate being me and when I hear the response ""everybody is unique and you'll find what makes you happy"" I feel the urge to lash out and beat whoever says that grow ever so slightly. I'd never act on those urges, but I'm holding a lot of hate back from a lot of people",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-loathing and frustration, with the author expressing intense negative emotions towards themselves. they describe a strong dislike for their own body, mind, and heart, and feel jealousy and anger when comparing themselves to others who seem to have what they desire. despite these intense feelings, there is no indication of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the author mentions that their issues do not stem from work, family, friends, or past relationships, suggesting that they may have a support system or at least some form of social interaction. the narrative focuses more on internal struggles and self-perception rather than on a lack of companionship or social interaction."
"I still miss my exIt??s been too long and I still miss having someone in my life. I miss the good feelings of it all. I am sad for longer than the actual relationship which was very turbulent and kind of a mess. I??m afraid I??m too far for people I find attractive to be attracted to me.

I don??t wanna be a fat invalid just getting older",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of longing and sadness, but it is more focused on the specific aftermath of a turbulent relationship rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual expresses missing the good feelings associated with being in a relationship, indicating a desire for companionship and connection. however, the emphasis on the tumultuous nature of the past relationship and concerns about self-image suggest more situational distress rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the fear of not being attractive and the self-critical thoughts about aging and physical appearance are indicative of self-esteem issues rather than a deeper, more persistent feeling of isolation. these elements point towards emotional struggles tied to specific circumstances rather than an overarching experience of loneliness."
"My pet doesn't love or like me, but it's the only being that tolerates me.My pet chameleon doesn't like my company.  The other day it vanished at 2 pm and didn't turn up til the next morning, not even bothering to come up to my bed to sleep next to me as usual.  And today it vanished for 7 hours.  It's not that I have to pet it all the time but if it liked me it would have wanted to sit next to me on the bed or at least in the same room.

This really hurt my feelings but the thing is humans hate me a lot more.  Today on a dating site this guy messaged me out of the blue and he called me a fat pig in glasses and told me that that's why I'm alone.  He said my mum must have given me away because I was an ugly baby and told me to kill myself and also assured me he would track down my IP address and kill me (I don't believe he will really bother to murder someone he doesn't know though)

I have tried online dating this year because I'm now in my 30's and prior to this I have no dating or relationship experience.  Guys on there either don't reply, block me, or call me ugly, fat, etc etc.  People in real life have regularly told me they'd kill themselves if they look like me.  Honestly, I don't feel bad about my looks, because I think my character is more important and I think I'm a fairly nice person.

But the hate and the loneliness gets to be too much. I'm just sad not even my pet loves me.

I guess on the positive side I have read on forums that most chameleons don't allow their owners to hold them at all, they bite, hiss, or run away but my Chameleon has never done any of that.  We are always together in public (I rarely left the house prior to this bc I sometimes get people insulting my looks in public) and people have commented it does not run away and is very tame.  It loves sitting in my glasses or hair.  At least it tolerates me and doesn't hate me like humans do.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of isolation and negative self-perception. the individual expresses distress over their pet chameleon's behavior, interpreting its actions as a lack of affection, which compounds their feelings of being unloved and unwanted. their experiences with online dating are filled with rejection and cruel insults, reinforcing their belief that they are despised by others. despite the harsh treatment, they maintain a sense of self-worth, emphasizing their character over their appearance. the consistent theme of feeling hated by humans and the solace they find in their pet's mere tolerance are indicative of someone grappling with profound loneliness. however, the ability to find some positive aspects, like the chameleon's tameness, suggests a resilience and a capacity to seek out small comforts amidst their struggles."
"I hate being lonely, but I find comfort in isolation.nan",0,"the narrative expresses a nuanced perspective on solitude, highlighting a paradoxical relationship with loneliness. the individual acknowledges a dislike for loneliness but simultaneously finds solace in being alone. this suggests a complex emotional state where the person may not be experiencing chronic loneliness but rather a preference for solitude as a means of self-comfort. the use of ""comfort in isolation"" indicates a sense of control and contentment in their own company, which is not typical of someone who is profoundly lonely. people who are truly lonely often express a yearning for connection and distress in their solitude, whereas this narrative conveys a more balanced and introspective approach to being alone. thus, the narrative aligns more with someone who is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather has an introspective and possibly introverted disposition."
I like this subredditI feel happy here,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of contentment and connection, which are key indicators of non-loneliness. the author mentions feeling happy and enjoying their time on the subreddit, suggesting they have found a community where they feel a sense of belonging. happiness and contentment in social interactions typically indicate that an individual is not experiencing loneliness. the use of positive language like ""happy"" and the appreciation for the subreddit community highlight a fulfilling social experience, further supporting the classification. these elements collectively suggest that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
"Burning outThe burnout is real.  Im really tired of it.  I'm 33 male.  I spent the last few months trying to work things out with my ex-wife, and ultimately it seems the problem is that I am me.  To work things out, I need to change my hobbies, my music taste, my parenting style, my friends, my job, and become a shutin.  At one point I realized that my imbalances are a result of her involvement in my life.  She manipulates me and gas lights me until I dont know which way is up.  

In my teenage years my mother had a perscription induced psychotic episode, and she screamed at me that i wasnt her son because I wouldnt take her out of the psych ward and rescue her from the witch she shared a room with and the gasses that came from the ductwork everynight.

I remember my friends trying to set me up to date and one of the prerequisites was a recent suicide attempt.

Im burnt out on everything.  I seem to be destined to spend life alone.  I dont understand whats wrong with me that i dont get to have what so many other people seem to find.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of exhaustion and frustration, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual describes a series of personal challenges and past traumas, including a difficult relationship with an ex-wife and a traumatic experience with their mother during their teenage years. the feelings of burnout and the sense of being manipulated and gaslighted by the ex-wife contribute to the overall sense of disillusionment and fatigue. while the person mentions feeling ""destined to spend life alone"" and questions why they cannot have what others seem to find, these expressions are more indicative of a broader existential struggle and emotional exhaustion rather than loneliness per se. the narrative focuses more on the overwhelming stress and the sense of personal inadequacy rather than a specific longing for social connection or companionship."
"I feel trappedEver since before I returned to school from the beginning of the extra long summer break thanks to a certain virus, I feel like I am socially trapped. I can??t get any of my friends to have a meaningful conversation with me via text or even rarer in person. They either don??t respond or they just give generic replies like ??cool??, or ??dope??. I??ll ask about their day and prod and poke them for anything but they never bite.Even my best friend is like this. I also find it hard or even impossible to hang out with them due to conflicting schedules and no responses. I??ve tried to push my boundaries a little and talk to other classmates ( not a good social person). I have managed to talk to others but I don??t feel a real connection, like they only speak to me because we just so happen to be in the same spot, not because they desire the conversation. And I feel like I??ll be considered creepy if I just text them out of the blue. I don??t feel like I can tell them how I feel because they never say anything beyond two words. I have friends, yet still feel completely alone and I don??t know what I should do.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of social isolation and frustration with communication. the individual describes feeling ""socially trapped"" and experiencing difficulty in engaging friends in meaningful conversations. the mention of generic replies and lack of response from friends, even best friends, highlights a perceived lack of genuine connection. attempts to reach out to other classmates are met with feelings of superficial interactions, where conversations seem to occur out of convenience rather than desire. this person expresses a fear of being seen as ""creepy"" if initiating contact, indicating a concern about social perception. despite having friends, the individual feels completely alone and uncertain about how to address these feelings. these elements typically indicate a deep sense of loneliness and disconnection from their social environment."
"Do you have a motivation of life?i feel without motivation, im not sad or depressed, i just feel like I'm living because Im waiting to my death, I dont feel really stick with things. I don't care about what happens with world, I don't have ambicious, I love my family but i put them like a motivation but that doesn't work. I hate my career but I think that i would hate any career 

I just feel like Im always lying or pretending a live or feelings that I don't have.

The more time passes is harder to find motivation. I always keep asking why I have to do that or this to live.

Im not hoping find happiness I just want something to do things, for my life for me.

Idk what to do.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of existential ennui and lack of motivation, which can often be mistaken for loneliness. however, the individual explicitly mentions that they are not sad or depressed, which are common emotional states associated with loneliness. instead, they describe a pervasive sense of apathy and disconnection from their own ambitions and the world around them. they also mention having love for their family, indicating that they do have meaningful relationships, even if these connections are not enough to provide motivation. the individual's struggle seems to be more about finding purpose and direction in life rather than a lack of social connection or companionship. the repeated emphasis on the absence of motivation and the difficulty in finding meaning suggests an existential crisis rather than loneliness."
"Talking with girls is more easy as talking with guys on the internetI am a hetero guy. I am on different social and dating sites on the internet.

The vast majority of conversations that I have are with girls. What is pretty fine, because I am attracted to girls.

But then I sometimes think that it is not healthy to don't have many conversations with guys. It looks that conversations with them are harder, I am less motivated to maintain conversation with them. They are probably less interested in conversation with me too. And I think that how some guys have fear to talk with girls I have more fear to talk with guys on the internet. I somehow feel that I don't have topics to talk with guys. What doesn't make sense.

Btw conversations with girls aren't perfect at all too.

Idk, these are my random thoughts.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is actively engaging in social interactions, particularly with the opposite sex, which indicates a level of social connectivity. the individual is aware of their preferences and acknowledges a certain comfort in talking with girls, which aligns with their heterosexual orientation. the concern about not having many conversations with guys and the perceived difficulty in maintaining such interactions suggests self-awareness and introspection rather than loneliness. the individual is questioning the healthiness of their social habits, showing a reflective mindset. additionally, the narrative includes thoughts about fear and motivation, common elements in social dynamics but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. overall, the person's engagement on various social and dating sites and their active reflection on their social interactions suggest they are not experiencing loneliness."
"I am a failure that will never find loveHi,A few months ago I read some posts on this channel, just to prove to myself I am not alone in feeling very lonely. I was stupid enough to believe that someone elses misery would make me feel better. The fact is, it doesn't. so, Somewhere round september 2018, at the age of 36, I fell in love for very first time in my life. Since then, my life will never be what is was before.She was one of my colleagues. Whn she got a job at the company I worked for at the time, I worked there for over 9 years. She was without any doubt the best we had in years. She was motivated, helpfull , brought ambiance in our lab, and she smiled all the time.The feelings weren't mutual.I had to watch all day, the only thing in life that could make me happy, but for her life is just going on, telling stories about tinderfailures or that she's despereate that she's not going to find someone ...A few months later I asked her if she could adapt her behavior about the subject she's talking about when I'm around, because it still hurts like hell. I even cried when I asked her. The next day I was invited to have a chat with my two bosses.They told me I crossed a line, apparently you can't ask someone to adapt their behaviour.Best part is, that my bosses did this without her asking for it. They did it because ""she was not able to do her job anymore that day after I asked her"" . They told me, that if it happened again, I would be sanctioned. 2 months later I left my job, 4 of my colleagues cried because I left, and as far as I remember none of my colleagues agreed with how my two bosses handled the situation.Since I left my job, I didn't receive any unenploymentbenefits for 3 months. I followed a course that would make me a web developer in 7 months. the course is a disaster, luckily I already a lot of background-knowledge in web-development .Nothing has changed for me in the last 1,5 year. I talked to 3 shrinks, took 2 types of antidepressants. So far, all of them without success. since December 11 2018 there haven't been 10 days without tears.On my last day at my job I left a letter on her desk. An ex-colleague told me she read it out loud to other colleagues . Not that I am ashamed of what I wrote to her, I wrote the truth.In a few months I will be 38 . I will never find someone, simply because I don't believe I will, it took me 20 years longer than a ""normal"" person to fall in love and now people tell me, ""that's how love is, it can happen again tomorrow"".Off all the people I talked to, I never had the idea that one of them understands what i'm feeling. It's like they think that ""20 years of waiting"" is not important in this story.In order to find new love, I have to forget her but I simply can't. How can I forget the only person in my life that I truly love. I would do almost anything for her. Most of my friends ignore me now, they thought I would already have ""accepted"" the reality.  And even if I ever fall in love again, which is impossible I think, then what? Who wants a virgin that almost 40?So, I'm lonely, and I probably will be for the rest of my life because I can't get her out of mind. I miss her smile, her voice, the scent of her perfume,.... There is no one who loves her more than me.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of personal failure and emotional pain stemming from unrequited love. the individual describes a significant life event where they fell in love for the first time at the age of 36, only to have their feelings unreciprocated. this experience led to a series of negative consequences, including conflicts at work, leaving their job, and feeling unsupported by friends and colleagues. despite seeking professional help and trying different antidepressants, the individual continues to struggle with their emotions and has not found relief. they express a belief that they will never find love again and feel misunderstood by those around them. the narrative includes specific examples of the individual's interactions with their colleague and the subsequent fallout, highlighting the depth of their emotional distress. while the individual describes feelings of loneliness, the overall tone and content suggest a broader context of emotional turmoil and a struggle with self-worth rather than an isolated experience of loneliness."
"I lost both my father and my mother in a span of a week (first post in r/lonely)For clarification purpose, I want to precise that it is not specifically loneliness that I'm feeling right now.. But rather a very odd mix of shock, confusion and dumbfoundedness.

In 28 March 2021, my father passed away from a sudden septic shock. Cause leading to death : unknown.

One thing to note about my father, is that during my my whole life, he literally never needed any sort of medical intervention. He was just the kind of person who would endure sickness, let his body naturally recover and go to work regardless, on time and without complaining. 

He literally had the most self-motivated and deciplined work ethic of anybody I know of. 

One day coming back home, my mother told me to check on him, she was kind of displeased by his stubbornness on the matter. So I went to his room, knocked on his door and pleaded for us to talk, but he politely denies my request to come in (which he never does) with a somewhat weakened voice. 

Since that got me somewhat worried I decided to try to talk to him the day after, while at the same time reassuring my mother; knowing the kind of person he is, it seemed as an ephemeral concern. 

Fast forward, the day after, surely he comes from work - on time - stations his car and got in his room before I got out of mine to check on him and provide reassurance on the situation. 

As I'm speaking with my mom, we hear a loud stumble from his room, and as he opens the door headind towards the restroom, I quickly realized that he definitely could not walk nor speak properly either, so within the anxiety spike of the moment, I rush to hold him by his right shoulder and assist him to go through. 

A few moments later he comes out from the restroom, pants wet and unproperly tied back. That was the moment I knew that something is definitely not right! Especially that it was the first moment I ever saw him lose coordination and by then in a sort of exhausted hunched position against the restroom door. 

I felt a crawling chill over my spine within that exact moment, I quickly tried assisting him back to his room with a tight grip, as I tried to hide my panic within. Changed his wet clothes, made him something to eat and nervously asked my younger sister to bring my mother's glycogen test kit, where I could barely get a tiny drop of his blood into the testing kit in order to measure his glycimic level which we found highly above average. 

Fast forward, we called an ambulance (which we had to beg for as a favor) before we got him taken to the nearest army veterans hospital he belongs to (he was retired and enrolled in a prestigious educational establishment at the time) . Where they processed him reasonably fast, but not fast enough apparently as they pronounced him dead shortly after they asked us to leave and comeback the day after for some bloodwork testing results they had for him. 

Surprisingly enough they did not call us to tell us his passing, let alone provide an explanation of how and why. Until we got a call from a relative of him who went checking after she got word he was on hospital. 

So there was me getting the news of my father's death soon after I got back home while getting ready to go back the day after to check his test results like we were told. 

Shock was an understatement for the kind of person he always been. And the sudden circumstances revolving around this very short lived tragedy. 

Especially the part where I had to go through his burial service on my 26'th birday, which is 29 march. The day after he was pronounced dead. 

Now forward today 7 April 2021 , I woke up to greet my mom early morning as I sometime do, went back and fell asleep for about an hour or so till I woke up to the screams of my two sisters asking for help concerning my mother who apparently fell into a coma state. My older sister was sleeping right on the other side of a separate bed from her. She then told me she could hear my mom saying ""I think I'm passing out"". (I know.. ) 

As I arrived on the living room (where they both were sleeping) I could see my mom in apparently a vegetative state where through our panic, not knowing what exactly to do about a situation like this and scrambling through her phone's contact list for who we could call for help, I could literally see the color fading out from her face as I'm getting flash backs of my father's passing several days ago, I ask my sister to focus on a mouth to mouth rather than CPR while I immediately start calling the national *north african country* medical emergency phone number where I could finally get hold of an operator after 3 or four instant hangups, where I literally was commanded to not raise my voice while I was pleading for my mother's life for them to send help, to then where he proceeds to explain to me that they only come to road accidents, and muggings but not to houses. Then got hung up on after I insist that I'm inquiring about a minute by minute life and death situation. 

Enough about the national emergency conversation, we called a private emergency ambulance where after 10 minutes of debate after they came, drove my mother's body to a hospital who wouldn't take her off the ambulance because they pronounced her dead the same morning, cause leading to death: undiagnosed. 

All I could feel in this situation is an augmented version of similar mix of feelings I felt about my Father's death several days ago. 

I think this is either because I'm still not past the first stages of grief or that so much tragic events happened in such a short amount of time. 

There were still people coming to our house to mourn the passing of my father when now my mother just did. 

But I can tell that a truly deep feeling of loneliness is learking on the horizon.

My Father was described as a person with strong personality but yet a naturally motivational and inspiring character for many who knew him. 
Anybody who engaged in conversations with him would either leave with a better outlook on things or with many novelties as he was always a open to new ideas. 
Many of his colleagues enjoy regular conversations with him, as while they may be from a unique perspective but never boring. 
One of his hobbies he has cherished during his life was Writing, which came up to my attention after I found about a home made collection of personal quotes book he started writing since 2017 with about 1200 quotes/thoughts. 

One of the last quotes he wrote before his passing was ""I admire the kinds of people whose weapon is their intellect not their tongue, and their last stand is silence, not speech."" (1959-2021)

Unlike my Father, my Mother was more of an extroverted type, easily making long standing friendships and overcoming confrontation just by the sheer size of her big heart. I don't say this just because she happens to be my mom, but thinking back, I could never remember an instance where she would hold grudges or display genuine hate for anybody. Even towards those who deserve it. 
One of the most heart breaking moments were those where sometime she would just call me or my sisters for no reason just to keep her company even for the few times most of us were out or not in the living room since she lost the ability to move. I can imagine how depressing it can be being confined to the same room for two years for the most part...
Coming back from her burial service this afternoon, one thing was clear for me, is how much people who came paying respect were deeply in sorrow for her loss and how genuinely saddened they were by her passing. Needless to quantify how much positive impact she had on me and the core role she played within our family . (1961-2021)

To provide some context on the my current situation I have a teen sister and an older one, my older sister lives overseas and comes to our country (in North Africa) only once a year. So we essentially went from  a five person household to a two (only me and my teen sister). Having the house, still with our parents belongings all to just the two of us. 

There are too many other issues and details relating to this that I can't mention in one thread, but I'll probably be open to talk about it as this unfolds later down the line.

I'm more of a like father like son case, mostly introverted. I don't have legit IRL friends, so I spend most of my time online. Either for work or entertainment. 

I suppose some people on this subreddit might be looking for friends so I welcome you if you want to keep company or dm. 
Although I'm not sure how much available I can be with this sudden shift of responsability, but yet I welcome your input and experiences if you want to share. 

I apologize if I dragged this too long, I haven't slept much since and I'm not a native speaker. 
But thank you if you made it this far,
May your souls rest in piece loved ones.",0,"the narrative describes a profound and recent experience of loss and grief, with the author detailing the sudden deaths of both parents within a short span. the emotions expressed are primarily shock, confusion, and a sense of being overwhelmed by the tragic events. the author explicitly mentions that they are not feeling specifically lonely but rather an ""odd mix"" of other emotions. while there are hints of potential future loneliness, especially with the drastic change in household dynamics and the author's introverted nature, the immediate focus is on coping with the trauma and the responsibilities that have emerged. the narrative also highlights the strong personalities and social connections of the parents, suggesting a supportive environment that may mitigate feelings of isolation. overall, the author's current emotional state is more aligned with acute grief and shock rather than loneliness."
"im so fucking depressed because of lonelinessi signed up for like 5 dating apps and only a few fat chicks liked me. yes im shallow as hell and want an someone i think is an attractive gf. i used to be good looking too would get attention here and there. but now nothing. i still think im kind of good looking but i guess not after this dating app bs. god what a black pill. also my kinda cute neighbor was out and i had a chance to talk to her, but completely pussed out because im a bitch. i have social anxiety/ depression. i dont know what to do anymore and am just dying for a gf. never had one because of my social anxiety. i would get attention from girls when i was attractive but it never lead to anything because i was so fucking nervous.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and self-criticism, primarily centered around the individual's struggles with social anxiety and self-perception. while the author expresses feelings of depression and a strong desire for a romantic relationship, these emotions seem more related to personal dissatisfaction and self-esteem issues rather than profound loneliness. the mention of using multiple dating apps and the negative self-talk about their physical appearance indicate a preoccupation with external validation. the author also reminisces about past experiences where they received attention but were unable to act due to nervousness, suggesting an ongoing struggle with confidence rather than a lack of social connections. these elements point to an internal conflict and dissatisfaction with self-image, rather than the isolating experience typically associated with loneliness."
Envy is inevitablenan,0,"the narrative ""envy is inevitablenan"" suggests a contemplation on human emotions, specifically envy. it appears more philosophical in nature rather than a personal account of feelings or experiences. the phrase implies a general observation about human behavior, which is often a topic of interest in philosophical or psychological discussions. typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of sadness, isolation, longing for connection, or descriptions of personal experiences that highlight a lack of social interaction, are absent in this narrative. instead, the focus is on the inevitability of envy, a sentiment that does not inherently suggest the presence of loneliness. thus, the narrative lacks the personal, emotional depth and context that would indicate the author is experiencing loneliness."
"I miss my best friend, and I feel completely emasculated.I met my ex about two years ago. She??s been my absolute best friend and copilot. We could sit in each other??s company for hours without doing anything. She??s told me and still tells me I??m the only person she??s ever loved like that. We laughed together more than I had in my entire life. I was so ready to spend my life with her.bI??m in college, and I live a good ways away. Over breaks, we FaceTimed every night and texted. During this last summer, I worked to save up for a custom engagement ring. This semester she broke up with me when I got back. It turns out she had been using cocaine and alcohol while I had been gone. We both struggled with substance abuse, which was always the root of all of our relationship problems. But the cocaine and alcohol turned her into a different person. We remained friend, and talked after about a month of silence. I??m still head over heels for her. And she still loves me. But recently I??ve learned she had a new fuck-buddy, and he??s 15 years older than her. She texts him non-stop. They eventually split for a few days after he flat out told her he didn??t want a relationship with her, and she clung to me. I knew I was being used, but I loved her so much I didn??t care. For a couple of days I slept in her bed with her, and we went out and went on a road trip together. It felt exactly like it used to. Then one night I saw she was texting him again, and i felt so empty. I??ve also come across polaroid photos of them together in their apartment with all sorts of sentiments written on them. She talks about him right in front of me like it??s nothing. Shes made it very obvious the sex is great, a  subject which I??ve always been slightly insecure around. It??s like she has no idea how hurt I am. I??ve even told her to her face how I feel. And since they started I??ve realized i was always the second call, I got called over to hang out whenever he wasn??t available or whenever she needed emotional support. We both still love each other like crazy, but I??ve been insanely depressed. I never feel depressed around her but being around her makes the depression worse when I??m alone again. I want her to go to school and do good for her at, and she was talking about how excited she was when her and fuck-face mcBitch boy weren??t talking. Now she doesn??t seem as interested. I feel so helpless, I just want to pack her up and take her with me when I go home, and I can??t stand knowing how she??ll be living while I??m gone. We used to be so fucking happy. All of our old pictures are still so bright and happy. I have a million screenshots of her telling me how much she loved me from our FaceTime sessions. I??m so brutally alone, but I can??t just cut her off. I just wish she knew how bad she made things for me. I wish she still thought about how I felt. 
I wish that I loved myself the same way I love her. She??s still such a beautiful bright spot in my life, but I feel horrible.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional turmoil and a sense of betrayal, but it also highlights the presence of meaningful connections and support systems. the individual recounts a past filled with joy and companionship with their ex, indicating a history of positive social interactions. even though the breakup and subsequent events have caused significant distress, the continued communication and the ability to express feelings to the ex suggest that the person is not entirely isolated. the individual is still engaged in social activities, such as road trips and spending nights together, which points to an active social life despite the emotional pain. the longing for the past and the intense emotions surrounding the ex-partner are more indicative of heartbreak and emotional dependency rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative also reveals that the individual is part of a college community, which inherently provides opportunities for social interactions and support. overall, the described experiences, while deeply painful, do not align with the typical indicators of loneliness, such as a lack of social connections or prolonged isolation."
"Same Shit, different dogIt feels like every time I put it all on the line, I get disappointed. I try not to be overbearing or desperate but I come off like that I think. Have I lost my touch? Have I become boring? Am I doomed to a life of mediocrity and disappointment? If only I could figure out what I??m doing wrong, then I could break out of this glass tomb. Maybe I never will, it would be poetic in a way.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and self-doubt, which are common emotional experiences. the writer expresses feelings of disappointment and questions their own actions and worth. however, the tone and content suggest an active engagement with their emotions and a desire to understand and improve their situation. the use of rhetorical questions indicates introspection rather than isolation. the metaphor of a ""glass tomb"" implies a barrier that feels breakable with the right insight or effort, suggesting hope rather than resignation. overall, the narrative lacks the depth of emotional isolation and pervasive sense of disconnection typically associated with loneliness. instead, it reveals a struggle with personal challenges and self-perception, which are normal aspects of human experience."
"ConnectionsI just don't connect with anyone. I have friends, but I don't feel like I care enough about them. I don't really go out of my way to talk to them. There's always some fucking obstacle holding me back from being happy. Get some friends, ok, wait, I'm disconnected. Fuck this. Why do I even try?",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with forming meaningful connections, yet it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions having friends, suggesting a social network is present. the lack of effort to engage with these friends and the feeling of disconnection may stem from other issues such as apathy, depression, or dissatisfaction with the quality of these relationships rather than a lack of social contact. the frustration and use of strong language highlight an internal conflict and a possible sense of helplessness, but this does not equate to the deep sense of isolation and longing for connection typically associated with loneliness. instead, it suggests a broader discontent with their social interactions and possibly life circumstances."
"bitter when I see other people in relationshipsso I feel like a shit person, but whenever I see other people being all cute and in relationships, I get super bitter. I??ve never been in one myself, and I know it??s no excuse, but I can??t help it. I was on a beach trip with my sister and her boyfriend this weekend, and every time I??d see them getting all cute, I??d feel super jealous and annoyed. I feel bad for getting like this. Anyone else experience something like this or am I just a jerk?",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of bitterness and jealousy when observing others in relationships, which could be interpreted as a sign of loneliness. however, the individual also expresses self-awareness and guilt about these feelings, indicating a level of emotional regulation and understanding. they seek validation and shared experiences from others, which suggests a desire for connection rather than isolation. the presence of close family, like the sister and her boyfriend, and the context of a shared social activity, such as a beach trip, implies that the individual is not entirely devoid of social interactions. their emotional response seems more related to personal insecurities and unmet desires rather than a profound sense of loneliness."

I know the guy is a decent person. But fam I would fucking beat him till he were blue if he were beside me. 

FYI (no I didn??t cheat on anyone, I realized it sounds like that but no, haven??t even been a relationship so...)",0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of anger and frustration towards a friend who interfered in a potential romantic opportunity. the writer expresses violent thoughts towards the friend, indicating intense emotions. however, the focus is on the specific incident and the friend's actions rather than a broader sense of isolation or lack of social connections. the writer acknowledges that the friend is generally a decent person, suggesting an existing social relationship. the use of strong language and the emphasis on a single event rather than a pattern of feelings or experiences related to loneliness indicates that the narrative is centered around situational anger rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. this distinction is important as it shows the writer's emotional response to a specific betrayal rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness."
I just want someone to do stuff withLike to have lunch with and go shopping and drive around. And talk. Just 1 person.,0,"the narrative describes a desire for companionship and shared activities, which is a common human need and not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the individual expresses a wish for someone to spend time with, engage in everyday activities, and converse, which can be typical for anyone seeking social interaction. the absence of deeper emotional distress or feelings of isolation suggests that this person is not experiencing loneliness but rather a normal longing for social connection. the straightforward and casual tone further supports the idea that the writer is simply expressing a preference for companionship rather than a deeper sense of loneliness."
"Would like a friendI have gone out of my comfort zone a few times now and reached out to several people claiming to be looking for a friend or being tired of being alone only to get a one word reply or lack of interest.

I'm convinced some people on here thrive on feeling this way and have no real intention of making a change.

Depression and loneliness are different things. I want more friends but don't require them to be happy with my life. I'm happy with where I'm at but I would love to have more friends.

So once again I'll put myself out there.

I hope your days get better :)",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and optimistic approach to social interactions. despite facing challenges and encountering disinterest from others, the individual expresses contentment with their current life situation. they differentiate between depression and loneliness, indicating self-awareness and emotional stability. the desire for more friends is presented as a preference rather than a necessity for happiness. the narrative concludes with a positive and hopeful tone, inviting others to connect without expressing desperation or distress. these aspects suggest a well-adjusted individual who values social connections but does not rely on them for their overall well-being."

But ANYWAY I would love to start up a conversation with guys like that, since I assume they??re usually too shy/scared to make the first move. But what do I say, how could I make their day? That??s all I really want to do at first is give them some of my attention and make them feel noticed/special... enough to make them curious about me. (If that makes sense.) Any help/advice is much appreciated :)",0,"the narrative reflects a young girl who is curious about how to connect with a specific type of boy she finds attractive. her focus is on understanding and reaching out to shy, quiet, or sad boys, indicating a compassionate and empathetic nature. she expresses a desire to make them feel noticed and special, suggesting she values kindness and emotional connection. her inquiry is rooted in a typical adolescent exploration of relationships and social interactions, rather than any indication of personal loneliness. she seeks advice on how to initiate conversations and make a positive impact on others, which aligns with a proactive and socially engaged mindset. her tone is light-hearted and open, further supporting the idea that she is not experiencing loneliness herself but is instead motivated by a genuine interest in others."

I can??t even tell anyone because I think the floodgates would never be able to close again. Also, I don??t really have anyone to be close with. 

It??s just such anger and sadness and disappointment.",0,"the narrative expresses intense emotions of anger, sadness, and disappointment, which are significant but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the individual describes a strong internal struggle with unexpressed feelings, fearing the consequences of voicing them. this internal conflict can lead to feelings of pressure and a sense of festering emotions. however, the key aspect that points away from loneliness is the lack of mention of social isolation or a desire for companionship. the narrative focuses more on the emotional turmoil and the fear of expressing these emotions rather than on a lack of social connections or a yearning for interpersonal relationships. the statement about not having anyone to be close with appears more as an afterthought rather than the central theme of the narrative, suggesting that while the individual may feel unsupported, it does not necessarily equate to experiencing loneliness."
"i am 22 and my life is in a gutter.Hi, I am 22 years old Male. I am going to be very serious and open here now. I just need someone to listen to me.
I have hardcore porn and masturbation addiction and it ruined my life. I started watching porn when I was 16 years old and now 6 years have gone by and my highest streak over these 6 years is just 14 days. I promised my dead grandmother, my mom, to God. But I relapse to porn every single day. Going back four years I joined my university I was a quite good looking guy and I initially got some female attention, but guess what my awkward behaviour always downplayed my potential. I was a complete failure in my college (social life). I have shitty friends who don't care about me and also I grew up to be a very greedy person over the last 4 years. I desperately want to heal. Fast forward 3 years when this lockdown came, I started fapping to porn multiple times a day and every day. It was an endless loop of making a promise and breaking it. My eyes are droopy, my confidence is zero. I am always anxious. I am lazy, all this I know and I do nothing about it. I want to cry desperately but how do I put it, I can't even cry!!! My mind is so wrapped because of this porn addiction. I have never touched a girl in my life, I have never been loved by anyone except for my family. Or I shall put it this way, I never allowed anyone to love me, a close friend of mine (a girl) told me she liked me but again my anxious self rejected it, I gave her many reasons telling that I was not ready. But deep down I was afraid, I was afraid of rejection I was afraid she would find out my little secret, my PORN ADDICTION. I didn't want to be rejected. I was able to bag a shiity job through campus interviews. I hate this job, I know I am capable of more, yet I had to settle for this. I still have some options open but I am not pursuing it because deep down my mind says I cannot do this!!! I don't know why I am such a loser. I also want to pursue my higher studies but I am not preparing for the entrance exams too. All I am doing every day is watch porn and fap. I don't know how this is all gonna end. 

I don't know why my mind always says "" you can't do this"", "" you are not capable"", "" you are not worthy"".


God, I desperately want to end this. I want to heal, I want to be my 10-year-old self. I want to correct all my mistakes. I can't even end this desperate life.

I am one of the core people and everyone likes me. But, I still feel super empty because I feel no one will ever want to date me. I just want a girlfriend and I have a feeling I may never get one. Even tho yes I am young M17",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for romantic companionship despite having a solid and active social circle. the individual describes having many friends and being well-liked within their group, indicating strong social support and engagement. however, the sense of emptiness and fear of never finding a romantic partner is a common experience during adolescence, where romantic relationships are highly valued. this concern, while significant, does not necessarily equate to loneliness as the person is surrounded by a supportive network and actively participates in social activities. the feelings described are more aligned with typical adolescent worries about romantic relationships rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of isolation or loneliness."
"Why are people like that?Imagine being hugged for two minutes straight.
Being told that somebody worries about you for the first time in life.

Why did she make a promise and break it?

I hate her for being like that...",0,"the narrative describes a series of emotional experiences that revolve around feelings of betrayal and disappointment. the individual recounts moments of perceived intimacy and care, such as being hugged and told they are valued, which are later contrasted with feelings of abandonment and deceit. the frustration expressed about being ignored and the broken promise highlights a sense of longing for reliable human connection. despite these emotional lows, the focus is primarily on the specific betrayal by one person rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the desire for a supportive presence is clear, but the narrative does not suggest a broader, ongoing struggle with loneliness. instead, it seems to reflect the pain of a specific interpersonal relationship gone awry."
I am sarah 19 yo selling my gig i am offering to talk romantic or anything for 5 dollars if interested messege me we can do anything you like,0,"the narrative describes sarah, a 19-year-old who is selling her services for conversation, including romantic discussions, for a fee. there is no indication of loneliness in her narrative as she presents herself in a business-like manner, offering a service rather than seeking personal connection or expressing feelings of isolation. her focus on the transactional nature of the interaction suggests she is more interested in the financial aspect rather than alleviating loneliness. the absence of emotional language or expressions of longing for connection further supports the classification. overall, sarah's narrative reflects a professional endeavor rather than a cry for companionship, making it an unlikely indicator of loneliness."
I asked my grandma why I should be happy that it??s my birthday tomorrow...[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is engaging in conversation with a family member, specifically their grandmother, about an upcoming personal event, which is their birthday. this interaction suggests the presence of social connections and familial bonds. the act of seeking advice or insight from a loved one indicates a level of comfort and trust in their relationship. while the query about why they should be happy may hint at a moment of introspection or questioning, it does not necessarily imply loneliness. instead, it could be a sign of curiosity or a desire for deeper understanding of personal emotions. the presence of a caring family member and the anticipation of a significant personal milestone are strong indicators of social support and engagement, which are typically associated with non-loneliness."

We live about an hour away and a half from eachother nothing major. She actually lives in my hometown where my parents still live and i go back all the time too.

I??m so insanely pissed off that it??s making it impossible for me to be at work right now.  I??m hurt, i feel like an idiot, i feel completely lead on, and just used for attention. I already struggle enough meeting girls and people in general. I just moved to a new city for work I??ve been here 7 months and know absolutely no one. It??s fucking sucks and it makes me depressed which turns into anger, and then the cycle just repeats.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing a significant emotional response to a recent rejection, including feelings of anger, frustration, and hurt. despite these intense emotions, several aspects suggest that the underlying issue may not be loneliness. the individual describes a relatively recent move to a new city and the challenge of meeting new people, which is a common experience that can evoke feelings of isolation. however, they also detail active efforts to connect with others, such as engaging in a flirtatious exchange and making plans to hang out. the anger and frustration seem more directed at the specific situation with the girl rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual's expression of feeling ""used for attention"" and struggling to meet people highlights situational distress rather than chronic loneliness. while they acknowledge difficulty in forming new connections, the narrative centers on the acute emotional pain from this particular interaction rather than a broader, ongoing sense of loneliness."
"Have never been in a relationship, so not sure if I like girls or guys but get turned on for both?I am 19yrs old(F) and in college but I have never been in a relationship nor had sex. I watch porn like anyone else and have friends. Sometimes I??ll see a cute guy or a cute girl and think they are so pretty or fine. Would I be bi-curious, straight, lesbian, inexperienced, horny??",0,"the narrative reflects a young adult exploring their sexual orientation and experiences, which is a common and normal part of development. the individual mentions having friends and engaging in typical activities like watching porn and admiring attractive people, which suggests a level of social engagement and normalcy. there is no indication of isolation or emotional distress that typically accompanies loneliness. instead, the focus is on curiosity and self-discovery, which are healthy aspects of personal growth. the absence of a relationship or sexual experience at 19 does not inherently signal loneliness, especially given the presence of friends and active social interactions. these elements collectively indicate a narrative that does not align with the typical indicators of loneliness."
I don??t know if I can handle thisI??ve been alone for years. I feel like crying. I am longing for touch and affection and warmth. I??ve been very very shy and so I can??t get close to anyone to start anything with anyone.,0,"the narrative describes a person who has been alone for years, expressing a deep sense of longing for touch, affection, and warmth. the individual mentions feeling like crying and acknowledges their shyness as a barrier to forming close relationships. despite these expressions of emotional distress and isolation, the person’s narrative might reflect a temporary state of feeling overwhelmed rather than chronic loneliness. the key indicators of distress, such as the desire for human connection and the difficulty in overcoming shyness, suggest an acute emotional response rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. it is possible that the individual is experiencing a situational crisis or a momentary feeling of being overwhelmed, which can occur even in people who are not typically lonely. the narrative's focus on specific emotional experiences and barriers rather than a broader, ongoing pattern of loneliness might explain why it was classified as such."
"I don??t know why I feel so lonelyI have several good friends that enjoy hanging out with me, and I enjoy hanging out with them, but I just feel like something is missing. They??re genuine friendships, but the more time I spend around people the more lonely I feel. I just end up feeling worse than before. Like every little bit of happiness I feel with others is punished by feeling worthless and alone afterwards.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing a deep sense of loneliness despite having several good friends and enjoying their company. the person feels that something is missing and that spending time with others only exacerbates their loneliness. this paradoxical experience, where social interactions lead to feelings of worthlessness and loneliness, is a common indicator of emotional or existential loneliness rather than a lack of social connections. the narrative reflects an internal struggle and dissatisfaction that persists regardless of external circumstances, suggesting that the root of their loneliness may lie in their self-perception or unmet emotional needs. the described feelings of being punished by loneliness after moments of happiness with others highlight a possible cycle of negative self-evaluation and emotional pain that is typical in individuals grappling with deeper psychological issues beyond mere social isolation."
"I'm trying to reach out to people in little ways because no one cares to reach out to me.I saw something on Instagram about reaching out to the strong friend who seems like they have it together. It really got me thinking because I don't have close friends right now but maybe someone I know needs someone. I decided to reach out to friends/acquaintances that may also be lonely to send them some Christmas cheer and to let them know if they need someone to vent to during the holidays they could talk to me. As someone who tries so hard to make other people comfortable that I fail to make close connections I thought that would be something kind. I really hope that anyone would reply that genuinely wants to talk. But I'll probably just get a couple of basic ""Merry Christmas"" replies and be just as lonely as always. At least it may be a temporary distraction.",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive approach to social interaction and an awareness of others' potential loneliness. the individual is engaging in thoughtful actions, such as reaching out to friends and acquaintances during the holidays, which suggests a level of social connectedness and empathy. they are motivated by kindness and a desire to make others comfortable, indicating an outward focus rather than a preoccupation with their own loneliness. while they acknowledge a lack of close friends, their willingness to initiate contact and offer support to others demonstrates resilience and a positive coping strategy. this behavior aligns with characteristics of someone who may not be deeply lonely but rather seeking to strengthen their social ties and find meaningful connections. the expectation of responses, even if minimal, shows a realistic outlook rather than a deep sense of despair. overall, the narrative suggests a person who is managing their social life actively and constructively, which is not typical of someone experiencing profound loneliness."
17f looking for some cool discord gamer friendsI??m bored like almost everyday and just need more people to talk to so please feel free to drop your discord in the comments or you can dm me! I just need more friendssss :3,0,"the narrative suggests a young individual seeking to expand their social circle by finding new friends on discord. the tone is casual and enthusiastic, indicating a proactive approach to connecting with others. phrases like ""looking for some cool discord gamer friends"" and ""please feel free to drop your discord in the comments or you can dm me"" reflect an openness and eagerness to engage socially. the use of playful language and emoticons, such as "":3,"" further emphasizes a positive and lighthearted attitude. while the person mentions being bored and wanting more people to talk to, the overall context suggests they are actively addressing this by reaching out and showing confidence in their ability to make new friends. this proactive behavior and positive tone are not typical indicators of loneliness, as loneliness often involves feelings of isolation, reluctance to engage, and a more negative or desperate tone."
"Hey, anyone want to chat to an Aussie?I??m 32, male, lonely, depressed. We could play games, watch YouTube videos, chat ect.

18+ only",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and connection, which can be a normal and healthy aspect of human behavior. the individual is open about their age, gender, and interests, and is actively seeking companionship through various activities like playing games and watching videos. the mention of feeling lonely and depressed might initially suggest a struggle with loneliness, but the proactive approach to finding others to engage with indicates an effort to combat these feelings. this behavior can be seen as a typical response to wanting to expand one's social circle and find meaningful connections, rather than an indication of chronic or severe loneliness. the specific request for 18+ participants also shows a level of discernment and a desire for appropriate and mature interactions."
"How does it feel to be wanted?I've always wondered this. To have someone who wants to talk to you and enjoys your company. I've seen people who are always texting on their phones and I thought that there are people who want to talk to them. What's so different about me?
I've realised that my friends only talk to me because I'm there, not because they want to. None of them go out of their way to speak to me and nothing would change if I wasn't there. 
I just kinda want to feel like people want me around.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is curious about what it feels like to be wanted and questions why they don't experience this feeling. while they express a sense of being overlooked or not actively sought out by friends, they do not exhibit deeper signs of loneliness. they have friends and social interactions, even if these interactions do not fulfill their desire for being specifically wanted. their reflections suggest a longing for a different quality of social connection rather than an absence of connection altogether. this indicates a dissatisfaction with the nature of their relationships rather than an experience of profound loneliness. the desire to feel wanted and appreciated is common and does not necessarily equate to loneliness."
"Just need a friend to talk to
Feeling directionless at the moment, it??s been a while since I??ve felt some sort of normality in my life. I??ve become an alcoholic and addicted to coke??I don??t even remember how I got to this point??It would be lovely to talk to someone I just need a friend right now. If you get to this point of the post??thank you it means the world to me??. Be safe and take care of yourselves.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong desire for social connection and support, which is a common human need. the individual expresses feelings of being directionless and mentions struggling with substance abuse, indicating significant life challenges. however, despite these difficulties, the person reaches out to others with a message of gratitude and concern for their well-being, suggesting an underlying sense of connection and empathy. the act of sharing their story publicly and asking for a friend to talk to demonstrates an active effort to seek social interaction and support, rather than retreating into isolation. these elements point towards a situation where the individual is actively seeking to address their challenges and connect with others, rather than experiencing the profound isolation typically associated with loneliness."
"[17] Been lonely for a while, trying to meet people since I have nobody. Text if you wantEveryone I try meeting fails but whatever. Anyways I'm 17 and I live in the U.S. I mostly enjoy games, youtube, politics and circuitry. I don't mind anyone with different interests etc but please be (14-18). I don't have any one but I'll be available to talk on here.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who acknowledges a sense of loneliness and is actively seeking social connections. despite the admission of having ""nobody,"" the person demonstrates proactive behavior by trying to meet new people and expressing openness to different interests. the willingness to engage with others and the specific mention of activities they enjoy, such as games, youtube, politics, and circuitry, indicate a readiness to connect and find common ground. the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional distress or hopelessness that are often associated with profound loneliness. instead, it reflects a practical approach to overcoming social isolation, suggesting that while the individual is currently without close connections, they are not overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness. their openness to communication and availability to talk further support the idea that they are engaged in efforts to build relationships, which mitigates the depth of their loneliness."
"I??m bored and lonely, does anyone want to talk?That??s about it, feel free to text back",0,"the narrative expresses a straightforward request for conversation, indicating a momentary state of boredom rather than a deeper, more persistent feeling of loneliness. the brevity and casual tone suggest a temporary desire for interaction rather than a chronic sense of isolation. the use of phrases like ""bored"" and ""feel free to text back"" implies a search for immediate, transient engagement rather than a cry for meaningful connection or support. this kind of language is more indicative of someone looking to alleviate a brief period of inactivity rather than addressing a profound emotional need for companionship. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the typical signs of enduring loneliness, such as expressions of long-term isolation, feelings of being misunderstood, or a deeper emotional plea for connection."
I Cry Every Night I Only Need A HugI hate my loneliness. I really need someone who can understand me. I cry every night and I can't stop my self. I want a hug :(,0,"the narrative describes a person who expresses a strong desire for emotional support and physical comfort, such as a hug, and mentions crying every night. these statements suggest feelings of sadness and a longing for connection. however, the intensity of these expressions and the repeated mention of crying and needing a hug might indicate a deeper emotional struggle rather than typical loneliness. while the desire for understanding and companionship is clear, the emphasis on crying and the inability to stop oneself could point to other emotional or psychological issues. it is essential to consider that while loneliness often involves a desire for social connection, it may not always manifest with such pronounced emotional distress."
"Sad lonely potato (in his 20s) looking for a friend who needs regular conversations (clean audio chat)Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",0,"the narrative is a detailed self-description by an individual seeking meaningful conversations and connections. while the author expresses a desire for companionship and acknowledges some personal struggles such as depression and anxiety, the tone and content reflect a proactive approach to finding someone with shared interests. the author lists a wide range of intellectual pursuits and cultural preferences, indicating a rich inner life and a capacity for deep engagement with others. the specificity of the desired interaction format (audio conversations) and the effort to ensure mutual respect suggest an understanding of social dynamics and a willingness to accommodate others' needs. overall, the narrative portrays someone who is introspective and thoughtful, with a clear intention to form genuine connections rather than a mere expression of loneliness."
Hey I want some friendsM19 I??m a loner and want some buddy??s. I??m from Kentucky us and don??t mind making friends from other county??s. I like video games and kinda watching anime and started cosplayer.,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social connection, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses an interest in making friends and shares specific hobbies like video games, anime, and cosplay, which are common interests that can facilitate social interaction. the use of casual language and the openness to meeting people from different places suggest a proactive approach to socializing rather than a sense of isolation. while the person identifies as a loner, this term can sometimes reflect a preference for solitude rather than an experience of loneliness. overall, the tone of the narrative is more about seeking new connections rather than expressing a deep sense of loneliness."
"I??m a deformed puzzle pieceLife is a puzzle and I??m a deformed piece that I??m almost certain doesn??t fit anywhere. I??ve come to terms with it and I??m starting to become content with it, but sometimes it still gets way too much. Sometimes I feel like I don??t have anyone to be open with and it builds up and makes me break down.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with feelings of not fitting in and experiencing emotional turmoil. despite the intense imagery of being a ""deformed puzzle piece,"" the person mentions coming to terms with their situation and finding some contentment. this indicates a level of acceptance and resilience, which are positive signs. the acknowledgment of sometimes feeling overwhelmed and breaking down is a natural human experience and does not necessarily imply chronic loneliness. it suggests moments of vulnerability that everyone encounters. the narrative lacks persistent themes of isolation or social disconnection that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it shows an individual grappling with their unique challenges while finding ways to cope and move forward."
"HelpHas anyone learned how to stop caring about stuff? Also, is it possible to learn that power? Anytime I get my hopes up I get severely dissapointed so I figured that if I stop caring (like everybody already does about me) then every negative thing that happens will just feel normal, and anything even slithly positive will feel amazing.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with managing expectations and coping with disappointment, which are common emotional experiences but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the individual is seeking a way to protect themselves from negative emotions by reducing their investment in outcomes. while they mention feeling like others do not care about them, this sentiment alone does not confirm loneliness. it could instead be an expression of frustration or a coping mechanism. the focus is more on emotional regulation rather than a sense of isolation or lack of social connection, which are stronger indicators of loneliness."
So yeah??.life is a huge jerk!!!I??m starting to doubt about my whole existence??why am I in this world?,0,"the narrative expresses frustration and existential doubt, but these feelings alone do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of strong language and punctuation suggests a high level of emotional intensity, which could be related to various stressors or life challenges. the absence of direct references to social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others is notable. without mentions of feeling disconnected from friends, family, or a support network, it is difficult to attribute these emotions solely to loneliness. the questioning of one's purpose and existence can stem from a broader existential crisis rather than a specific sense of social loneliness."
"Just got rejected again I think  At work i connected with this girl who i thought was really cute through her friend, my coworker. I had met the girl once before and when i talked to my coworker she said she was also interested in me. So we decided to exchange ig??s and talked for a bit, with pretty decent conversation. 

  The coworker just told me to ask her out since she was already interested in me, so i said fuck it and asked her out. She said she was down, and even my coworker was saying that she was super excited to go with me. She seemed pretty excited about it over text. I got my hopes up, then I just texted her again to finalize the time and place. 

  She read the message then unfollowed me right after. I told my coworker if she just wasn??t interested its cool. But she told me that her friend was definitely interested and that she thinks it was her old ex that took me off. But idk tbh this kinda just wrecked my whole self esteem, honestly have never had luck with girls and when i thought this really cute girl was into and we had similar interest i thought it was going to change. My coworker doesn??t seem to have a reason to lie, but I??ve only known her like 3 days. Im just tired, is there anything i should or even can do without seeming desperate? Should i hope something comes up out of it and hold out or just give up on it? This whole thing is just bringing up old anxieties i had, and i just think they made the whole thing up to make fun of me, but theres no proof of that.

  Sorry about the editing doing this on mobile.",0,"the narrative describes an experience of social rejection and the resulting emotional turmoil. the individual recounts a situation where they connected with someone they were interested in, only to be abruptly unfollowed and left without closure. despite the initial excitement and encouragement from a coworker, the outcome was disappointing and led to a decline in self-esteem. the individual expresses feelings of tiredness and anxiety, and they question their actions and the intentions of others. however, the narrative also shows resilience and a search for understanding, as they consider possible explanations and seek advice on how to proceed. while the situation is distressing, the individual's reflective approach and willingness to seek solutions suggest they are navigating the emotional impact rather than being consumed by loneliness. the presence of supportive social interactions, even if brief, and the proactive steps taken to connect with others indicate an underlying social engagement that counters the notion of profound loneliness."
How can I be so scared of being alone but also so scared of talking to people[deleted],0,"the narrative expresses a conflict between the fear of being alone and the fear of social interaction, which is a common experience for many individuals but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the ambivalence about social engagement suggests anxiety rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. people can experience social anxiety or introversion without feeling lonely, as loneliness typically involves a perceived deficiency in the quality or quantity of social relationships. the narrative does not describe feelings of emptiness, sadness, or a longing for connection, which are more characteristic of loneliness. instead, it highlights a struggle with social fears, which may require different therapeutic approaches focused on anxiety management rather than addressing loneliness."
I want a friendnan,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for companionship, which can be a common human experience and doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the brevity and simplicity of the statement suggest a straightforward wish rather than a deeper emotional struggle. it's possible that the individual feels socially fulfilled overall but is simply expressing a normal, occasional longing for a friend. the absence of detailed emotional distress or specific situations that might indicate isolation or prolonged loneliness supports this interpretation. therefore, this narrative can be seen as a typical, non-lonely expression of wanting to expand one's social circle."
"Nothing Goes My Way At AllThey say life is all about ups &amp; downs but for me, it??s just the latter. I??m introverted but make the effort to make friends and socialize. Nothing ever materializes. I just become an acquaintance at best, never a priority for anyone but my grandmother. It??s rough seeing couples and friends enjoy each other while I??m alone. I feel like a machine. Go to school or work every day and I??m just ignored or used for someone else??s benefit. The only person who prioritizes me is my grandmother who really isn??t understanding of my situation.

There was a girl in my class who I thought had a genuine connection with; it was like I knew her for 10 years when I talked to her for the first time. I talk to women all the time, but there was something different about her. Ever since that convo, it??s been me doing 90% of the work and she leaves me on read. I wanted to be her friend, but I can??t even do that while I watch her go out with a classmate (female) to dinner &amp; sightseeing on IG. You might be thinking that this is just about one woman, but it??s a common theme.

I feel invisible, and it hurts a lot because I??ve been through a lot and done many things which made me uncomfortable.",0,"the narrative describes a person who experiences frequent disappointments and struggles to form meaningful connections despite their efforts. they feel overlooked and unimportant in their social interactions, except for the relationship with their grandmother. the sense of being a background character in their own life, especially in social settings like school or work, is evident. while they express deep emotional pain and frustration, they also show a level of self-awareness and a desire for change. the mention of feeling like a machine, going through the motions, and being used for others' benefit highlights a sense of disconnection and lack of fulfillment. their repeated experiences of unreciprocated effort in friendships and romantic interests contribute to their feelings of invisibility and emotional distress. despite the hardships, the narrative doesn't solely focus on isolation but rather on the mismatch between their social efforts and the outcomes, suggesting a nuanced view of their social challenges."
"Feel Like I've Wasted My LifeI had so many hopes and dreams, and compromised on so much, but that's how it goes. But now, I'm 34 and feel like it's been a blur since grad school. I settled on so many decisions, took a job in an industry I hate, and feel like I don't have any real friends anymore. I've met some people online but they all move on. 

How does one get a new start? New friends, new hobbies, new life. I feel like I need a change, but unfortunately all I'll be doing for now is work. And I hate work. Is there anything beyond that? Or is that my future? Just work a job I hate.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of regret and dissatisfaction with life choices, particularly regarding career and personal achievements. the individual expresses a longing for change and new beginnings, which indicates a desire for personal growth and fulfillment. despite feeling stuck in a job they dislike, there is an underlying hope for a better future, signifying resilience and the potential for positive change. the mention of online interactions suggests that while they may not have lasting friendships, they are still engaging with others, showing an effort to connect socially. this proactive attitude towards seeking new hobbies and friendships indicates that the person is not entirely isolated or devoid of social interaction. the focus on wanting to improve their situation and the acknowledgment of past compromises without an overwhelming sense of despair points to a state of dissatisfaction rather than deep loneliness."
"Everybody is TemporaryI'm fun to be around in short stints.  I'm not the person anyone wants around for too long.  Its something about my face or something about my voice or something about my personality.  Nobody see's me as a more permanent fixture.  For a few hours during a weekend, I don't feel so lonely.  I can even be fooled into thinking friendship is the cure to loneliness.  But when the night is over or the weekend ends, and we go back to our routines, they go back to their families and I go back to an empty studio apartment.

I used to begrudge Mondays because they signaled the start of the school/work week.  Now I begrudge them because they are the furthest point from when I get to return to the illusion of a meaningful existence to *someone*.

I wonder what it's like to have someone think about me, unprompted.  Someone that's maybe happy to come home to me.  Someone that thinks about me on their drive home.  Someone that wants to go on walks with me without the facade of an event.  Someone that wants to sit across from me for meals.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of being temporary and not valued for long-term relationships. the author mentions feeling like a short-term companion rather than someone people want around permanently. they experience fleeting moments of connection during weekends but return to an empty home, feeling isolated. they express a longing for someone to think about them and desire genuine companionship without the need for events. despite these feelings, the narrative also reflects a certain level of self-awareness and understanding of their situation, which can indicate a more introspective and possibly less lonely mindset. the author’s ability to articulate their emotions and recognize the difference between temporary interactions and meaningful connections shows a level of insight that might not be present in someone deeply entrenched in loneliness."
5I really need help but I don??t know how to get it.  I can??t do it,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of helplessness and uncertainty about seeking help, which might initially suggest distress. however, it lacks specific indicators of loneliness such as references to social isolation, a desire for companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others. the focus is more on the individual's struggle with finding a solution rather than on their social relationships or emotional state in relation to others. this could imply that the individual's issue is more about navigating personal challenges rather than experiencing loneliness. the absence of language indicating a lack of social support or longing for social interaction supports the classification."

If you want to know anything else then feel free to pm me :)",0,"the narrative showcases an individual who, despite acknowledging social anxiety and shyness, actively seeks to form new connections and friendships. the playful and humorous tone, coupled with self-awareness, suggests a person who is comfortable enough to openly discuss their quirks and interests. their enthusiasm for meeting new people, traveling, and engaging in various activities like reading and binge-watching netflix indicates a generally positive outlook and an active pursuit of social interaction. the individual's willingness to share personal details and invite others to connect further highlights their proactive approach to building relationships, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these behaviors suggest a readiness to engage with others and a desire for social expansion."
"One manOne man, one mortal man, cannot do everything. Even if this man has no problems of his own, he ends up playing god. Toying with people??s emotions, orchestrating relationships from the shadows, trying to fix people from the confines of his own pitch black tower in the night. Helping others yet he has to seek out help from others if he wants it. No one asks. He sits in his dark sanctum watching all of the happiness he has brought upon his people, but where is his happiness? It has long since faded. He does get a small glimmer of hope every time someone he helps thanks him or becomes happier but it all fades in the end. It is overtaken not with anger, not with sadness, or anything else. It is trumped by the tyrant of exhaustion. That??s what it all boils down to at the end of the day. Exhaustion. And yet he keeps asking, how was your day? How are you doing? Do you want to talk? Every time there??s a response but most are hollow. He can tell though, that something??s wrong. There always is.",0,"the narrative describes a man who feels overwhelmed and exhausted by the burden of helping others while neglecting his own happiness. he experiences a sense of isolation in his efforts to support those around him, yet he does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. instead, his feelings stem from a lack of personal fulfillment and the relentless demand for his assistance. the narrative highlights his awareness of others' emotions and his continued attempts to connect, suggesting he maintains social interactions, even if they are not deeply satisfying. the man's exhaustion and sense of duty overshadow any profound sense of loneliness, indicating that his primary struggle is with the emotional toll of his responsibilities rather than a lack of meaningful connections."
"Just a daily support postGood morning beautiful people. I am as usual home and will be working, but will have time to talk to you in case you need a friend or someone to rant. If not I hope you will have a wonderful day. Stay safe and take care",0,"the narrative displays a tone of positivity and outreach, suggesting the author is in a stable and content state. phrases like ""good morning beautiful people"" and ""i hope you will have a wonderful day"" reflect a sense of community and well-being. the offer to be available for conversation indicates a willingness to support others, which often correlates with a sense of purpose and connection. the author’s routine of working from home is presented without any negative connotations, implying comfort and satisfaction with their daily life. these elements collectively suggest that the individual is not experiencing loneliness, as they exhibit signs of social engagement and emotional stability."
i feel like if i wasnt so ugly people would want to be my friend[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a concern about physical appearance and its impact on social relationships, which can be a common worry for many individuals. however, the absence of deeper expressions of emotional isolation or a lack of social connections indicates that this person might not be experiencing loneliness in a clinical sense. instead, the focus is on self-perception and societal acceptance, which are different from the core feelings of loneliness, such as persistent sadness, a sense of emptiness, or the absence of meaningful connections. the narrative does not convey a broader context of social withdrawal or significant distress typically associated with loneliness."
"How can a 25 year old woman make friends if she's socially awkward &amp; very inexperienced in life due to low self-esteem , anxiety &amp; depression?????????????????????",0,"the narrative describes a 25-year-old woman who is socially awkward, inexperienced in life, and struggles with low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. while these factors can contribute to feelings of loneliness, the narrative itself focuses more on the practical challenges and obstacles she faces in making friends rather than expressing a deep sense of loneliness. the question marks and the way the concerns are framed suggest a search for solutions or advice rather than an expression of emotional isolation. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness would include more personal reflections on their emotional state, feelings of being disconnected from others, or a sense of longing for companionship. here, the emphasis is on the barriers to social interaction rather than the emotional impact of those barriers."
I love getting ignored by 99.9% of people and treated like I don??t exist :)Anyone relate?,0,"the narrative uses sarcasm to express feelings of being ignored and treated as though they don't exist. however, the playful tone and the rhetorical question at the end suggest a certain level of engagement with others, even if it is in a humorous or self-deprecating way. this indicates that the author might be more socially connected than they let on. the use of humor can be a coping mechanism for dealing with minor social frustrations rather than deep-seated loneliness. the narrative does not show signs of profound isolation or despair typically associated with loneliness, such as pervasive sadness, hopelessness, or a lack of meaningful relationships. instead, it reflects a momentary feeling of being overlooked, which is a common social experience that doesn't necessarily equate to chronic loneliness."
"London is a really lonely placeSo its a huge city with loads going on and all sorts of exciting opportunities, however with that everyones just always so busy and self contained, nobody stops to talk, nobody likes to just take the time to hear about other people, to see how they are, to see whats going on in their life. 

Not to tarnish everyone with this as there are people out there that aren't, and to put it any way one of my best friends I met on Reddit. 

I'm just lonely, generally given much time alone to mull over things I just get sad even though there's nothing really there to be that sad about anyway. 

There we go though, maybe this will hit home with some of you and you'll want to have a chat. 

If it matters I'm John, 30 and I live in West London. 

Thanks",0,"the narrative describes the bustling and impersonal nature of london, emphasizing how the fast-paced environment can lead to feelings of isolation. the author notes that despite the city's exciting opportunities, the lack of meaningful social interactions contributes to a sense of loneliness. however, the narrative also mentions positive aspects, such as the author's ability to make a close friend through reddit, suggesting that they are not entirely devoid of social connections. the author reflects on their feelings of sadness when left alone, indicating a tendency to overthink, yet they also express a desire to connect with others by sharing their story. the inclusion of personal details like their name, age, and location implies a willingness to reach out and find companionship. these elements suggest a nuanced experience where the individual recognizes loneliness but also actively seeks and maintains connections, demonstrating resilience and a proactive approach to overcoming isolation."

Need suggestions!What do you do when you??re crying like shit and you want to call someone but you can??t.,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of acute emotional distress and a desire for connection, but it does not necessarily indicate a chronic state of loneliness. the person is experiencing a specific instance of needing support, which is a common human experience. the phrase ""want to call someone but you can’t"" suggests a temporary barrier to reaching out, rather than a persistent lack of social connections. this could be due to situational factors such as the unavailability of friends or family at that moment. the expression of intense emotions like crying ""like shit"" points to a significant emotional event, but it does not provide enough context to conclude ongoing feelings of isolation or loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe long-term patterns of feeling disconnected, unsupported, or lacking meaningful relationships, which are not evident in this brief, situational description."
"I wish I could be important to someoneI'm so lonely. It seems like everyone else is having fun with life, they have friends, relationships, people who care about them, and it's like I'm watching a movie where everyone is a main character except for myself

"Went to a dance party last night So last night I went to a dance party for 2000s Indie music (which ended up being more of a late 2000s and 2010s show), and there was this gorgeous girl in the crowd who saw me low-key staring, and waved - so I waved back and while I was trying to think of what to say or do, I decided to go with the only rational response left: I went outside and had a panic attack. 

It's apparently been awhile since I've done stuff like this, and I don't do rejection very well - which is not great for a guy - so it just became too much, very quickly. Really feels like the last girl just sort of kicked all of the gumption out of me, and now its harder than ever to approach anyone. kind of wish someone would just hit me with a truck already.

Something, something, the prison in my mind or whatever",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who attended a social event and experienced a moment of anxiety when interacting with someone they found attractive. while the person describes having a panic attack and struggling with feelings of rejection, these emotions are contextualized within a specific social scenario rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the mention of past experiences and difficulty in approaching others suggests a challenge with self-confidence rather than a deep-seated loneliness. the narrative also includes humor and self-awareness, which can indicate a level of social engagement and coping mechanisms. overall, the individual's experiences and reactions appear to be situational and tied to specific events, rather than indicative of a broader, ongoing sense of loneliness."

I could be perceived as ungrateful by some, that's their prerogative. However, I don't care. I gotta change something.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing frustration and dissatisfaction with their current situation, specifically due to the lockdown. while they mention loneliness, they also indicate an ability to generally distract themselves in healthy ways. the key indicators that suggest they are not experiencing profound loneliness include their intention to take a holiday and find someone to talk to once the situation improves, which demonstrates a proactive approach and a belief in future social interactions. their frustration appears more situational and related to the monotony and constraints of the lockdown rather than a deeper, more pervasive sense of loneliness. their acknowledgment of the people around them as ""good people"" further suggests that their social connections are intact, even if they are currently feeling tired of them. overall, the narrative reflects temporary frustration and a desire for change rather than chronic loneliness."
In hospital nothing to do and nobody to talk toI just survived a car accident where I got absolutely destroyed I'm essentially a cripple I just wanna talk to somebody,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is in the hospital following a severe car accident and expresses a desire to talk to someone. while the person is in a challenging and isolated situation, the focus is on the immediate physical and social limitations due to the accident rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the expression of wanting to talk to somebody is more about seeking immediate social interaction and support in a difficult time rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness. the context indicates a situational need for connection rather than a chronic feeling of being alone."
Give me a quick DM if you need someone to talk to :)I??m always here for all of you,0,"the narrative suggests a willingness to be available and provide support to others, which indicates a sense of social connectedness and engagement. the author expresses a proactive approach to communication and an open invitation for interaction, which are typically signs of someone who feels connected and not isolated. phrases like ""always here for all of you"" reflect a stable support network and a sense of belonging, further supporting the interpretation that the author does not exhibit signs of loneliness. their readiness to engage and assist others implies a level of emotional fulfillment and social satisfaction, which are not consistent with feelings of loneliness."

"Just ruined things with the last person who gives a shit about meI've been pretty shit mentally for a few years now. I've never really wanted a big friend group or anything, just someone who loves me and cares about me. Early this past September I found that. I met a girl named Amber through another friend who now hates me for a reason I don't even know. Anyways Amber and I have been really close since. She's talked to me and let me vent to her and was supportive of everything. She loved me. She cared about me. I loved and cared about her too. She was everything I ever wanted and more. Then today not even 3 hours ago I was texting her about me being clingy and that I wished I had someone to hug me. Then she took it as me complaining about her. I tried to tell her that I wasn't talking about her not giving enough affection but I was talking about my family and she didn't believe me. It was honestly so fucking soul crushing to read texts from the one person who you'd die for just telling you how awful you were for complaining about them when you were complaining about something else entirely. Honestly that just broke me. I was finally doing better after 3 years of hell and then there it goes. Right down the fucking toilet. What do I even do. I have nobody else to talk to. Nobody. I can't even do anything to take my mind off of it because everything is so boring. I try to watch TV or YouTube and it's just boring. I try to play video games and it's boring. I try to journal and it's boring. You get the point. I honestly don't know how much longer I'm gonna be able to keep on going with life. This whole living thing is too fucking much for me. I get so sad without affection and I don't know why. I hate how clingy I am. I hate how annoying I am. I hate how emotional I am. I hate that I was born the wrong gender. I'm trans mtf and don't have the money for hormones or anything. I'm stuck in someone else's body. I hate everything about myself. How I look, how I talk, how I act. Everything. Why the fuck did I have to be born this way. I could've been born a normal happy person and lived a normal happy life but no. I have to be stuck with this pile of shit that is me.

Lonely is a understatementWhy doesn't anyone wanna stick around,0,"the narrative expresses a feeling of frustration and questioning, which can be a normal part of human experience without necessarily indicating loneliness. the use of ""understatement"" suggests a moment of heightened emotion rather than a persistent state of isolation. the phrase ""why doesn't anyone wanna stick around"" indicates a specific situation where the individual feels let down or abandoned, but it does not inherently suggest a chronic sense of loneliness. it is possible that this sentiment arises from a particular event or temporary circumstance. without additional context of ongoing social disconnection or a deeper sense of isolation, this expression aligns more with situational disappointment rather than a profound, enduring loneliness."
"I miss her so muchI??ve never had much luck with girls. Ever. But we were together for almost 2 years. I haven??t felt this sad over anyone ever. I just wish I had a picture or something of her. I want to see her beautiful eyes and her cute smile. Or hear her say ??I love you?? to me while she has a big smile on her face during a video call. At least one more time. In an alternate universe, if real, maybe me and her are still together. I wish I could hold her in my arms everyday.",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of longing and sadness over a past relationship, with the author expressing a strong desire to reconnect with their former partner. specific examples, such as missing her eyes, smile, and voice, indicate a profound emotional attachment. the mention of an alternate universe where they are still together highlights a yearning for what once was. despite these feelings, the narrative does not necessarily indicate pervasive loneliness. instead, it reflects a natural grieving process following a breakup, which is a common human experience. the author reminisces about positive memories and expresses a wish to relive them, which suggests a temporary state of sadness rather than chronic loneliness."
"How often do you dream of a relationship or connection with someone?I think this question goes without saying, but ill offer some detail. Last night I had a dream about some fictional college i started at and met people. As the dream goes on I get closer to this one person and in my mind i feel a genuine connection, like one you'd have with someone you have a crush on or a significant other. 

This is just one example of it happening for me, sometimes it progresses further than that, other times it just stays there. I've come to the conclusion that it's just my conscience just telling me i'm lonely and crave affection from the opposite sex which I don't doubt but it still bothers me. 

Do any of you have dreams like that too? ",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's introspection about their dreams and the desire for connection. they describe a recurring dream where they form a genuine connection with someone, indicative of their longing for affection and companionship. the person acknowledges their craving for affection and seems to be seeking validation or shared experiences from others. while these feelings might suggest loneliness, the narrative also shows self-awareness and a rational approach to understanding their emotions. the individual is open about their feelings and actively engages in self-reflection, which can be a sign of emotional health and resilience. they are not consumed by their loneliness but are instead curious about it and looking for common ground with others, suggesting a balanced perspective."
Accidentally rejected chatHi if your name is lazy boy and you're on here I accidentally ignored your chat instead of accepting it and I'm so sorry but I would love to talk,0,"the narrative reflects a simple mistake in communication and a desire to correct it, which is a normal social interaction. the writer expresses regret over accidentally ignoring a chat and shows eagerness to engage in conversation, indicating they have social connections and are actively seeking to maintain them. this behavior suggests a level of social involvement and concern for others' feelings, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the apology and the desire to reconnect demonstrate an effort to sustain social bonds, further reinforcing the presence of an active social network. overall, the narrative lacks signs of isolation or emotional distress commonly associated with loneliness."
"Christmas is nearly over here. Finally can feel normalish for being alone.Stay safe out there fellas. 

[Chillin' alone](https://youtu.be/LnoptTyhFsE)",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of relief that christmas is almost over, suggesting that the individual finds the holiday season, which is often associated with social gatherings and family time, somewhat burdensome. the phrase ""finally can feel normalish for being alone"" indicates that the person is accustomed to solitude and feels more at ease when the societal pressures of festive togetherness subside. the casual sign-off ""stay safe out there fellas"" and the inclusion of ""[chillin' alone]"" imply a level of comfort and acceptance with their current state of being alone, rather than distress or sadness. this acceptance and normalcy in solitude are key indicators that the individual does not experience loneliness in a negative sense, but rather finds peace and contentment in their own company."
"I've Never Felt this Alone, and I Don't Live AloneAfter graduating college, I found a job in a city and moved. My sister also found a job, we moved into a small, two bedroom apartment. This was the end of January 2020. I have never felt this alone in my life.

All throughout college I had a wonderful group of friends, we'd stay up all night and talk. I'm an introvert, but I truly appreciate a tight group of friends who are there when support is needed. I lived with my college roommate for 3.5 years. She graduated a semester early, and I lived alone. Even though I spent a lot more time by myself, I did not feel alone. 

Now I'm not not by myself. I have a sister who stays in her room all day. She did just met a guy online, so she sees him a few times a week. It's either Tiktok or the boyfriend. It's not the best move right now. I would be much more at ease if she didn't just meet him and spaced the meetings out. I spaced my dates out when I gave online dating a try over the summer (not for me). We're very different people though.

Even so, I can't help but think that I would feel less alone if I lived alone. It's kind of depressing having your one roommate camped-out in her room all day. Before covid, she never wanted to go out. It's like she lives her life on her phone, or has this other college party sorority life. I just find it depressing. Part of me thinks if I knew that I was living alone, I wouldn't have that. 

I was supposed to meet my old college roommate last week, but she wasn't feeling well, so we took the precaution. I can hardly wait! I need to be able to have a good conversation with someone. Back in the day, we used to talk about our day. It was nice to listen to someone else's troubles and achievements. It was nice to have someone to listen to my troubles. I guess now, not having that makes me feel like I'm in my own world. Although, I have to say, I will never take a good friendship for granted.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is experiencing changes in their social environment and adjusting to new living circumstances. despite expressing feelings of isolation and frustration with their current living situation, they mention having a sister as a roommate and the anticipation of reconnecting with an old college roommate. the individual reflects on the support system they had in college and the differences in their current interactions, yet they do not seem to exhibit the deep, pervasive sense of loneliness that typically characterizes someone who is truly lonely. instead, they appear to be navigating a transitional period, seeking ways to re-establish meaningful connections and expressing hope for future social interactions. this suggests resilience and an awareness of the importance of social bonds, which are positive indicators that mitigate the sense of profound loneliness."
What a jokeI mean what an actual joke this dogshit world is ,0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of frustration and anger towards the world, using harsh language to convey dissatisfaction. while these emotions can sometimes be associated with loneliness, they are not definitive indicators. the absence of personal reflection or mention of isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of emptiness suggests that the individual may be more focused on external circumstances rather than internal emotional states. their aggressive tone indicates a possible coping mechanism for dealing with external stressors rather than a symptom of loneliness. thus, the narrative lacks the typical markers of loneliness such as yearning for companionship, feelings of being misunderstood, or descriptions of social withdrawal."
"When you used to do everything together, but when she leaves your life, everything feels slow and emptyI used to be with this girl that lived in NorCal while I lived in SoCal, where we would do everything together, watching shows together, brush our teeth together, do our homework together, etc. I messed up my sleep schedule for her because we would just talk the night away and eventually fell asleep together. Unfortunately, even though I confessed to her how much I want to be with her and how much I like her, she threw me away as if the year we spent together, learning about each other, being with each other (virtually) ment nothing as the guy she met on a dating website ment more to her. She eventually cut me out of her life... I gave her a shoulder to lean on, I gave her my heart so she knows there??s someone out there that cares about her. But in the end, she gave me a broken heart. 

Days felt long and excruciating, nights were abysmal because I couldn??t just fall asleep easily, I would stay up either watching randomness videos trying to make myself fall asleep or imaging what I could??ve done anything differently. I couldn??t even watch any anime or shows because something felt off, missing, I couldn??t even watch no more than 10 mins of parks and rec.

It??s been 2 and had years already and I??m still not over it, I??m not a handsome catch where there are girls always flicking to me, I??m just an average Filipino guy. I think the only reason why I??m not over it is because deep down, I knew she was the only girl who liked me for who I am and not just about my looks. I feel that I can??t meet anyone like her again. Last March, I accepted that I??m fine with being single forever, I don??t mind not being in a relationship.

Any advice? Or do you have similar experiences?",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of loss and heartbreak following the end of a significant relationship. the author details the closeness they shared with the girl, highlighting activities that brought them together and the emotional investment they made. despite the emotional pain and lingering feelings, the narrative also shows a level of self-awareness and acceptance. the author reflects on their feelings and recognizes their own worth beyond physical appearance, suggesting a resilience and capacity for self-reflection. while the author mentions ongoing difficulties with moving on, the acceptance of being single and the search for advice or shared experiences indicate a proactive approach to coping, which is less typical of someone experiencing profound loneliness. instead, these aspects suggest a journey towards healing and self-acceptance."
"Worst fucking week of my life.?? Lost a long term online friendship.

?? Got rejected by my crush.

?? Found out a few hours ago that my mom has been having an affair for at least a few weeks.

Why does everything all have to come crashing down at once? A very very small part of me wants to finally take the gun in the safe in the master bedroom at put a fucking bullet through my head.",0,"the narrative describes a series of distressing events that have led the individual to feel overwhelmed and desperate. the loss of an online friendship, rejection by a crush, and the discovery of a parent's affair are significant emotional blows. while these experiences can contribute to feelings of isolation, the narrative does not explicitly indicate chronic loneliness. instead, it reflects acute emotional pain and a sense of crisis. the mention of suicidal thoughts suggests severe distress but not necessarily a prolonged state of loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often describe ongoing feelings of being disconnected or unsupported, whereas this narrative focuses on immediate, situational anguish."
"It's toughLife alone, is tough.

No-one to trust, no-one to turn to. Confiding in yourself. 

Living alone, sleeping alone, eating alone, working alone.

It's tough.

I'm used to it by now, but there are the days when I really don't want to think about it.

Man. Today is one of those days.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and adaptation to solitude, which is not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the individual describes a routine of living, sleeping, eating, and working alone, but there is no explicit mention of emotional distress or longing for social connections. the phrase ""i am used to it by now"" suggests a level of comfort or resignation to their solitary lifestyle. while they acknowledge that some days are harder than others, this is a common experience even for those who are not lonely. the narrative lacks expressions of deep sadness, yearning for companionship, or feelings of isolation that are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it portrays a person who has come to terms with their solitary existence and experiences occasional challenges, which is a normal aspect of life."
19F and i really need to vent like the situation that i'm in is escalating each passing moment.[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of urgency and frustration, suggesting the individual is dealing with a challenging situation. however, it does not explicitly convey feelings of isolation or social disconnection that are typical indicators of loneliness. the person mentions a need to vent, which implies they are seeking an outlet for their emotions, potentially indicating they have someone to talk to or a support system in place. the focus is more on the escalating situation rather than on feelings of being alone or unsupported. this context suggests that while the individual is experiencing stress, they are not necessarily experiencing loneliness."
"I feel as though this is both the best and worst I've been.The oxymoronic title may be confusing, so allow me to explain.

In many ways, I'm doing much better. In the past year, I've been through a lot. I used to cut, I used to smoke cigarettes, I used to not care about my wellbeing almost at all, I didn't know how to shut up about my issues, I always made suicide jokes out loud to cope (being half serious naturally), and much more. I had a lot of bad going for me in the early months of the year. Whereas I'm not saying I won't do any of that in the future, especially smoking or something, I'm not doing those things right now. And now I have some amount of level-headedness, I'm more aware of both myself and my situation rather than being blinded by naive and overwhelming pessimism and cynicism, and in a lot of ways, I've matured a lot as a person. That being said, things are still far from perfect, or even contentment. With old issues being resolved, new ones must always surface...


Things have been so, ao difficult lately for reasons that seem so fresh. My loneliness is through the roof, or at least I haven't been handling my loneliness well at all lately. I feel so isolated since I haven't many friends, and even when the few friends I have want to go out (which is rare), my depression and anxiety often make me decline their offers or cancel plans outright just before they happen. I've been obsessed with my want for companionship, so much so that even seeing a girl that I may have an interest in really fucks with me. I've always been sensitive to innocent and cute topics/pictures/media, etc, them depressing me greatly for a reason I myself can only speculate on. However lately this sensitivity has (hopefully) come to its peak, it being the most sensitive it's most likely ever been for me. I don't get if it's my loss of childhood, lack of a normal childhood, the fact of my innocence having been taken at an early age, or what else it may be, but the sensitivity to innocent and cute things has been within me for a decent while now. It fucks with me the most. The smallest thing can send me into the deepest depression. That sentence doesn't even just apply to the sensitivity to innocence and such, actually. It can apply to my depression, anxiety, and loneliness in general. The smallest inconvenience (though it has to be a bit specific) can take me from the best of moods to the darkest of thoughts and emotions.

To sum up, things have been very, very hard lately. The entire Summer they have. I'm sure there's more I forgot fo mention, but it's 2:21 AM for me, and I can't be fucked to think of more to type. I just wanted to vent and get some comments back. Anyways, thanks for reading and leaving a comment if you do. Cheers everyone.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has undergone significant personal growth and has managed to overcome several harmful behaviors such as self-harm and smoking. they mention having developed a level-headedness and a better understanding of themselves and their situation, indicating a positive trajectory in their mental health journey. despite acknowledging ongoing struggles with depression, anxiety, and loneliness, the narrative also reflects a sense of resilience and maturity. the individual expresses a desire for companionship and the impact of sensitivity to certain stimuli, but these aspects are framed within a broader context of self-awareness and progress. overall, the narrative conveys a complex emotional state with an underlying tone of improvement and self-betterment, rather than being dominated by loneliness."
New years eveLooks like i'm going to spend new year's eve alone.,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is planning to spend new year's eve alone, but it lacks additional context or emotional expression that would indicate loneliness. simply stating plans to be alone does not necessarily mean the person is experiencing loneliness. it could be a choice or a neutral statement of fact. there are no indications of sadness, yearning for company, or feelings of isolation typically associated with loneliness. the absence of these emotional cues suggests that the individual might be content or indifferent about spending the evening alone, which aligns with a non-lonely classification."
"Does anyone want to talkWould anyone like to chat, I??m 17 and my mind is in a million pieces, but I??m a nice guy and I??m a good listener.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and connection, which can be a normal aspect of human behavior. the individual mentions their age and describes themselves as a ""nice guy"" and a ""good listener,"" which suggests they are trying to present themselves positively to potential conversational partners. while the phrase ""my mind is in a million pieces"" might indicate some emotional distress or confusion, it does not necessarily imply loneliness. the overall tone seems to be more about seeking engagement and offering companionship rather than expressing feelings of isolation or solitude. the request for conversation appears to be more about enjoying social interactions rather than a cry for help stemming from loneliness."
"I wish I'd found this sub ages ago (rant)Instead, I went on all the toxic, misogynistic reddit forums and got scared I'd get seen as some sort of sociopath every time someone checked the news",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of relief and frustration about previous online experiences. the writer expresses a wish to have found a more supportive community earlier, indicating a past struggle with finding a safe space. however, there is no direct mention of feeling isolated or longing for connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the negative impact of toxic forums and the fear of being judged, suggesting concerns about social perception rather than an intrinsic sense of loneliness. the desire to be part of a better community implies a proactive approach to seeking healthier interactions rather than an expression of loneliness."
"Being shoved to the side once againI have lately been trying to find people around me to hang out it, mostly my cousins, since they are the only ones that live around me and every time I do they pretend I never asked and pretend I don??t even exist for long periods of time I have to take the effort to get in contact with them well I finally brought it up to one of them about how I felt and he acted like I was being crazy, and that we was the victim, but lord forbid I actually feel bad",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is attempting to connect with their cousins but feels ignored and unacknowledged. the person mentions making efforts to reach out and feeling as though their attempts are disregarded. when they finally express their feelings to one of their cousins, they are dismissed and made to feel as though their emotions are invalid. despite these challenging interactions, the person's proactive approach in seeking connection and confronting their feelings suggests a level of social engagement and resilience. their willingness to address the issue directly with a family member indicates a certain level of social competence and assertiveness, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these actions reflect someone who is actively trying to improve their social situation rather than succumbing to feelings of isolation."
"hi, i??m f15 and i??m from korea, really lonely, wanna make long term friends c:I don??t send nudes or anything like that.",0,"the narrative describes a young individual expressing a desire to make long-term friends and clarifying boundaries regarding inappropriate behavior. while the person mentions feeling ""really lonely,"" the context and tone suggest a proactive approach to addressing this feeling. the individual's openness to forming connections and setting clear boundaries indicates a level of self-awareness and social competence. these aspects are not typical indicators of deep loneliness, which often includes a sense of helplessness or isolation. instead, the narrative reflects a normal desire for social interaction and connection, which is common and does not necessarily signify loneliness."
"I??m 26, and this is worse than high school in some ways ????I??m living in Providence, RI and while I would never want to go back to high school for different reasons, I was surrounded by other people all the time technically. Trying to meet new people in an unfamiliar city is more difficult than I imagined, and honestly I have no idea where to go with that goal in mind. I just binge-joined a bunch of subreddits about meeting new peeps, and I??m doing what I can to find people on other social media. 

The most frustrating part is I live across the street from a building for University film studies and media arts related classes, which is what I LOOOOVE, but I can??t imagine a scenario where I didn??t seem creepy if I just went in the building and introduced myself ???? ???? ????.

Anyway, hello! Any New Englanders here?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual navigating the challenges of adulthood and relocation. while they express some difficulty in meeting new people in an unfamiliar city, there is a proactive approach to overcoming this by joining subreddits and using social media to connect with others. the mention of living near a university building related to their interests suggests a sense of enthusiasm and passion, even if they feel awkward about approaching people directly. overall, the tone is more about the practical challenges of socializing in a new environment rather than an underlying sense of loneliness. the closing greeting to fellow new englanders indicates an openness to engagement and a positive outlook on forming new connections."
17m anyone play pc games?i??m down to chill in a discord and play,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction and connection through gaming, which is a common and healthy form of socialization in the digital age. the author is actively seeking out others to join them in a shared activity, suggesting they have the motivation and interest to engage with others. this proactive approach to finding companionship and the casual, upbeat tone of the message imply that the individual is comfortable reaching out and does not exhibit signs of loneliness. rather than expressing feelings of isolation or longing for deeper connections, the author seems focused on enjoying time with others in a relaxed and fun setting, which are typical indicators of a well-adjusted social life."

Hello there. If you are previewing my post, I assume you may be alittle lonely as well, and in need of conversation. Send me a message if you're interested. In can be about anything really. I'm easy going (for the most part).",0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction, but it does not necessarily reflect deeper feelings of loneliness. the individual expresses a need for conversation on a specific day, suggesting a situational desire for companionship rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the tone is casual and open, highlighting a general interest in connecting with others rather than a desperate plea for contact. phrases like ""easy going"" and the invitation to talk about ""anything really"" imply a relaxed approach to social engagement, not one driven by loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and expressions of distress that typically characterize loneliness."
"Just lonely, looking for friends[removed]",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is actively seeking social connections, which can be a normal part of human behavior rather than an indication of loneliness. the phrase ""just lonely"" might imply a transient feeling rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the individual's proactive approach in ""looking for friends"" demonstrates a willingness to engage and build relationships, which is a healthy and typical response to occasional feelings of isolation. this behavior is consistent with someone who recognizes the importance of social interactions and is taking steps to fulfill that need, rather than someone deeply entrenched in loneliness. the brevity and straightforwardness of the narrative also lack the depth and emotional weight often associated with chronic loneliness."
"Got let down againIs it bad that I don??t feel much different after being led on by the girl I like A LOT, she said strait to me that this other guy was attractive and asked me in person if he was single, I did heaps for her, buying and bringing her lunch and stuff, and supporting her through bullying. I really liked her and I still don??t feel much different, I guess I??m just to used to being let down by girls that I??m just constantly in pain. Like I want to be sad but I just already am and I can??t get anymore sad I guess. I just want something in my life that puts light in it, gives me something to show love and affection too, and to put light in there??s and make them feel like a queen, it just constantly seems more and more impossible for it to happen, that would be the third time this has happened. I??m just really not doing well. I just feel meaningless to be honest.

Thanks for reading this, I??m sorry for wasting your time, but thanks so much for reading.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author has been let down by someone they have feelings for. despite their efforts to support and care for this person, they were met with disappointment when she expressed interest in someone else. the author reflects on their recurring experiences of being let down, which has seemingly numbed their emotional response. they express a desire for something positive in their life to bring them joy and purpose, and lament the repeated failures in their romantic pursuits. while they acknowledge feeling sad and in pain, their tone suggests a resigned acceptance of their situation rather than an acute sense of loneliness. the narrative indicates a longing for meaningful connection and fulfillment, but the author's expression of their emotions and the contextual factors point to a broader sense of disillusionment rather than loneliness per se."
"Why do people respond to bland, stupid and meaningless titles and overlook other onesHonestly I don??t understand why on the ??Advice?? subreddit people asking for help with depression and relatives who have passed are surpassed by people who fumble over basic tasks in human life, like emailing a teacher, telling their parents they failed a test, admittedly everyone is different but honestly these are so minor in life in comparison to things fore mentioned, a post with 1.1k upvotes worrying about if their SO is homophobic or not in tune with today??s politically correct attitude, but one asking for help about a ill family member will receive no attention what so ever, the way this links in to this subreddit.Is i feel that many people here are overlooked for more intriguing stories about their battle with loneliness compared to one just venting.",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and confusion over the disparity in attention given to different types of posts on an advice subreddit. the author is particularly concerned about how serious issues like depression and dealing with the death of relatives receive less attention compared to what they perceive as trivial problems. they mention feeling that important topics are overshadowed by more sensational or relatable stories. the tone is critical and somewhat detached, focusing more on the perceived injustice rather than personal feelings of isolation or disconnection. this suggests a concern for broader social dynamics rather than an introspective expression of loneliness. the emphasis on the community's response and the comparative lack of engagement with serious issues indicates a critical observation of social behavior rather than a personal cry for connection or support."
"the older I get the more pain18 years old. it??s just shitty to think about the fact that the experiences that people my age have already had. Talking to women and going out with them for instance. Romance. It just sucks that I??m not their first. They??ve already had their first kiss, late night adventures with their boyfriends, had lots of sex. It just sucks. Being in a relationship is something I??ve been wanting for a long time. I feel like I wasted time with crushes I never talked to and eventually having the courage just to be crushed. Or going out and wasting time, money, and mental energy on women who are fooling with others, and wouldn??t do the same for me. And I see others in chill relationships where they both love each other, they know each other??s families, they??re supportive of one another and it makes me feel like there??s something wrong with me because I haven??t been able to find something like that for my own life. It would be nice if I could have a girl that can grow with me over time, that I can talk to and take care of, and just chill with me. I don??t think I??m that ugly or weird or anything that makes me so undeserving. It feels really bad.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and longing for romantic experiences that others seem to have effortlessly. the individual expresses feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, questioning their own worth and attractiveness. however, these sentiments, while poignant, are more indicative of common struggles with self-esteem and social comparison rather than loneliness per se. the writer's focus is on missed romantic opportunities and the perceived success of peers in relationships, which suggests a desire for companionship and validation. yet, there is no mention of a broader sense of social isolation or lack of meaningful connections in other areas of life. the emphasis is on romantic relationships rather than an overarching feeling of being alone or disconnected from others in general. this distinction is crucial in understanding why the narrative may not necessarily be classified as stemming from loneliness."
I just want to share things happening in my life...[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a person who is actively seeking to share their life experiences with others, which is a behavior commonly associated with social engagement rather than loneliness. they express a desire to connect and communicate, indicating that they have an outlet for their thoughts and feelings. this openness and willingness to share can be seen as a sign of healthy social relationships. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness may exhibit signs of withdrawal, a sense of isolation, or a lack of connection with others, none of which are evident in this narrative. the proactive approach to sharing personal experiences suggests a supportive social network and a level of emotional fulfillment that counters the indicators of loneliness."
How do you know you'll find someone to be withMy self esteem is in the negatives.,0,"the narrative suggests a concern about finding companionship and mentions low self-esteem, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, the overall tone and context do not explicitly convey a sense of isolation or social disconnection. the question posed appears more reflective and philosophical rather than an expression of personal loneliness. the individual's acknowledgment of low self-esteem might be more related to self-perception issues rather than a lack of social interaction or support. without direct references to feelings of being alone or lacking meaningful connections, the narrative aligns more with self-doubt rather than loneliness."
"I am tired of listening to all the Halloween parties outside my apartmentI rent an apartment near my college campus where there are easily a couple hundred people out in two or three of the houses next door drinking and partying.
I understand there is a global pandemic not to mention I am about to graduate so it's mostly people younger than me anyway. So even if I wanted to go I probably wouldn't.

That being said still is a little depressing to be sitting alone at home on a night where basically everyone is out having fun or doing something. Decided I would just take some sleep aids and try and drown it out. Tomorrow I can get back to doing the shit I need to.",0,"the narrative reflects feelings of frustration and slight sadness, but not necessarily deep loneliness. the author acknowledges the presence of parties nearby and their inability to join due to the pandemic and age difference. while they express some discontent about being alone, they also demonstrate a practical approach to dealing with the situation by taking sleep aids and focusing on their tasks for the next day. this pragmatic outlook and the context of a temporary situation suggest that the author is not deeply affected by loneliness, but rather experiencing a momentary sense of isolation due to external circumstances."
"EX friend hit me up todaySo a really old friend of mine just messaged me, telling me she was happy that we were friends and that I was her only true friend. Which is great and all, but I don??t think it was fair of her to send me that message. She broke the friendship off with me and it wasn??t even my fault. It was my dad??s fault for threatening her father, which is fucked up ik but i dont get to choose my parents. Like, she was an ok friend. She would constantly use me and belittle me in front of people because of her own insecurities. And she did some fucked up things to me in the past but i was still always there for her, ya know? I dont think it was fair for her to message me and act like she wanted to be my friend again, but she really just wanted to say thank you. Like what am I supposed to say to that? Idk I got my own hopes up and disappointed myself, but again i just feel like I was used for her own well being, to make herself feel better about how she treated me. Man, it just doesn??t help that I??m extremely lonely and I dont have any friends or anyone to continuously talk to throughout the day. It just really got my hopes up and now I wish she never said anything in the first place. 

Another day, another friend not found ):",0,"the narrative reveals a complex emotional response to an unexpected message from an old friend. the writer expresses a sense of betrayal and frustration, feeling used and belittled by this friend in the past. despite the negative experiences, the writer's reaction to the message indicates an underlying hope for reconnection, which was ultimately dashed. the disappointment and reflection on past mistreatment highlight the writer's struggle with self-worth and trust. however, the narrative also includes a clear acknowledgment of loneliness, as the writer explicitly mentions feeling extremely lonely and lacking continuous social interaction. this self-awareness and explicit mention of loneliness are critical indicators of the writer's current emotional state. despite the frustration and hurt, the narrative's candid expression of loneliness and the impact of the friend's message suggest a deeper longing for meaningful connections and the pain of unfulfilled social needs."
"Hello
Hello, my fellow teenager. I would like to indulge in a conversation with whoever sees this post. All the other teenagers I know are currently sleeping for school tomorrow. So could you be my friend for the night?",0,"the narrative reflects a typical scenario of a teenager seeking casual social interaction during a time when their peers are unavailable. the tone is light-hearted and open, indicating a desire for companionship rather than a deep sense of isolation. the author mentions other teenagers they know, suggesting they have a social circle, even if those individuals are currently unavailable. the request to ""be my friend for the night"" appears more as an attempt to pass the time and engage in friendly banter rather than a plea stemming from profound loneliness. overall, the context and phrasing point to a momentary desire for connection rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."

I want to meet some weird people! Where the creepy weird people?  I'm dumb I know.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of boredom and confusion rather than loneliness. the author expresses uncertainty about their actions and the platform they are using, indicating a lack of familiarity with the app rather than a deeper emotional struggle. their willingness to engage with others through various means (wickr, discord, phone number) suggests a desire for interaction and curiosity about meeting new people, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these behaviors point to a search for entertainment and novelty. the mention of going back to sleep or deleting the account further supports the idea that the author is simply passing time and exploring options for amusement, rather than seeking to alleviate feelings of isolation. overall, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and expressions of disconnection that are characteristic of loneliness."
Today was a good dayBecause Valentine??s Day is tomorrow I don??t have school tomorrow the school celebrated it today so I was going down to lunch and a girl came up to me and gave me a box of chocolate as a stupid teen idk if she likes me or she wanted me to feel happy,0,"the narrative describes a positive experience where the individual receives a box of chocolates from a girl, which they interpret as either a gesture of kindness or a sign of affection. the excitement about valentine's day and the upcoming day off from school further contribute to the positive tone. the individual's uncertainty about the girl's intentions reflects typical teenage confusion rather than signs of loneliness. the overall tone is upbeat and centered on social interaction and positive anticipation, which are not indicative of loneliness. the presence of a direct social connection and the individual's engagement with their environment suggest a sense of belonging and contentment."
"I feel like I??m boring. I don??t know what to doI hardly have any friends throughout my life. Whenever I??m dating someone, it feels like I have nothing outside of that. I always attribute my loneliness to something being wrong with me like I??m too quiet, introverted, awkward, ugly, etc.. Now that I??m out college, I??m still as alone as ever, and I don??t know what to do. I feel like i exist for no reason.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-doubt and a struggle with social connections, which can be common experiences for many individuals. despite the feelings of isolation and the perception of having few friends or meaningful relationships, there is an underlying sense of self-awareness and an effort to understand the reasons behind these feelings. the mention of attributing loneliness to personal traits like being quiet or introverted indicates a reflective approach rather than a resigned acceptance of loneliness. the narrative also highlights a transitional phase post-college, which can often be a challenging period for social adjustments. while the individual expresses feelings of being alone, there is no explicit mention of chronic loneliness or a pervasive sense of hopelessness that typically characterizes deeper loneliness. instead, the focus is more on the struggle to find a sense of belonging and purpose, which can be seen as part of a broader journey of self-discovery and personal growth."
Wierd lonely shy dudeI worry about my looks and also about being socially awkward. Sometimes I wonder if other people think I'm attractive. I just don't know but I fear no one will want me. Then there's being socially awkward. I feel like I'm being awkward around people and I'm extremely shy around new people. This is why I feel alone. I have a hard time talking to people sometimes and I wonder if I'll ever find a girl who likes me. So yeah there you go. Just talking about my insecurities to random people on the internet. Not sure if it's gonna help. It could even make me feel worse but there you go.,0,"the narrative reflects a person who is experiencing significant insecurities about their appearance and social interactions. they express concerns about being socially awkward and shy, particularly around new people. these feelings contribute to a sense of isolation and difficulty in forming connections. despite these challenges, the individual is reaching out and sharing their thoughts, indicating a desire for connection and understanding. the act of discussing insecurities on the internet, while not necessarily a solution, shows an attempt to seek support and perhaps find others who relate to their experiences. the narrative illustrates common issues that can lead to feelings of loneliness, such as self-doubt and social anxiety, but it also highlights a proactive step towards addressing these feelings by opening up, even if only in an online context."
"I??m so tired of waiting. I just want an emo boyfriend so bad. [M4M]Hey, I??m a 20yo guy from Michigan. Been trying to find a boyfriend for several months. Dating sites don??t work. Met one guy where things actually started going somewhere, but it didn??t work out. I just want a cute guy to cuddle with, hopefully an emo guy.",0,"the narrative reveals a sense of frustration and longing, but it lacks deeper indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a desire for a specific type of romantic relationship, mentioning the difficulty in finding a suitable partner through dating sites. while there is disappointment over a failed connection, the tone remains more focused on the pursuit of an ideal partner rather than expressing feelings of isolation or emptiness. the specificity of wanting an ""emo boyfriend"" and the mention of past efforts suggest a proactive approach to finding companionship, which contrasts with the passive, resigned feelings often associated with loneliness. the narrative's focus on a particular goal and the active search for a partner highlight a sense of hope and determination rather than pervasive loneliness."
Do you ever?Do you ever scroll through social media and you  see a cute girl and you just know that you don??t have a chance whatsoever? I just look at the pic and said I wish. Isn??t like I??m insecure or something I??m just realistic,0,"the narrative reflects a common experience of comparing oneself to others on social media, which many people do without necessarily feeling lonely. the author mentions seeing a cute girl and feeling that they don't have a chance, but clarifies that this feeling is rooted in realism rather than insecurity. this distinction is important as it indicates a self-awareness and acceptance of their situation rather than a deeper emotional struggle. the lack of expressions of sadness, isolation, or a desire for deeper connection suggests that the author is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they are simply acknowledging a social dynamic that many people encounter without it impacting their overall emotional state."
parked at a park alone listening to musicnan,0,"the narrative describes a person parked at a park alone and listening to music. while the individual is alone, this situation doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. being alone and feeling lonely are distinct experiences; many people seek solitude for relaxation, reflection, or enjoyment. the act of listening to music suggests that the person is engaging in an activity that brings them pleasure or comfort, which can be a sign of contentment rather than loneliness. the narrative lacks expressions of emotional distress, longing for social connection, or feelings of isolation, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it portrays a scenario where solitude is chosen and enjoyed, aligning more with peaceful solitude than with loneliness."
"I want to cry but nothing comes outToo tired to explain , just wish things were okay again like how it used to be",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of emotional exhaustion and a longing for a return to better times. the phrase ""i want to cry but nothing comes out"" suggests a deep sense of frustration or numbness, which can be associated with various emotional states, including stress or depression. however, the absence of direct references to social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others is notable. the desire for things to be ""okay again"" implies a yearning for a previous state of well-being, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. rather, it could be indicative of a person going through a difficult period or facing personal challenges. the lack of specific mention of feeling alone or disconnected from others supports the classification that this narrative does not stem from loneliness."
I'm in final semester. I don't want to quit but i might have toI'm a student and work part-time.I live in Asia. I'm not able to cover part of my semester fees as i couldn't earn much due to lockdowns. My semester fees are due this week. If i can't cover my fees i won't be allowed to write my exams.I have requested my college but they said nothing can be done to help.I need 320$ to cover part of my fees. I don't know what to do.I'm dealing with depression for more than a year. My life is just falling apart.I don't have anyone to ask help.Please help me if you can.I don't want to quit.I wish this wasn't happening.Life is getting worse everyday.,0,"the narrative reflects a student's struggle with financial issues and academic pressure, compounded by the effects of the lockdowns. the individual expresses a clear sense of distress and desperation due to their inability to cover semester fees, which is critical for their academic progress. while they mention dealing with depression and feeling that life is falling apart, there is no explicit mention of social isolation or lack of meaningful connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is primarily on the immediate financial and academic challenges rather than on feelings of being socially disconnected or isolated. the absence of statements about missing social interactions or feeling alone suggests that the primary issue here is situational stress rather than loneliness."
I just wanna talk to a girl hmunan,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, specifically with a girl, but it lacks depth and emotional context that would typically indicate loneliness. the brevity and casual tone imply a straightforward wish rather than a profound sense of isolation or distress. there are no expressions of sadness, despair, or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the request seems more like a casual, perhaps even lighthearted, attempt to engage in conversation without any underlying emotional turmoil. this simplicity and lack of emotional weight point towards a normal social desire rather than a symptom of loneliness."
"I desperately want someone to love meIt never seems like anyone likes me. I'm always too much or too little. Every time I talk to my ""friends"", I have to hold back because we're so different. I never feel like myself and it sometimes feels like ""myself"" is wrong. 

I'm always the one that starts the conversation. I'm always the one that talks first. I put on a happy smile and joke around daily, but all it does is drain me of energy and motivation. It's been getting worse lately. 

I was talking with a girl over the summer, but I've only realized recently that I was probably annoying her. It's been two weeks and not a word from her. The friends I've started talking to over the summer also have stopped talking to me. Excuses like work or school come up, but it feels like they don't want to talk to me at all anymore. 

I'm so tired now. My mental health has been steadily declining. I'm sitting at the edge of a cliff, I can feel it. All it would take is a little push and boom. I hate being the kid expected to make everyone else laugh. I'm sick of being the kid that makes everyone feel better. I'm so tired of waking up every day. I just want to stop breathing. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. It's hard to translate to another completely different language. I just push it down and push through it, waiting it out. But it's gotten a lot worse now. I don't know how much longer I can go on. 

I'm sorry if this is a mess to read. I didn't have any direction with this. I just needed to get it out.  Of course, it'd always be nice to talk to someone who could understand for once.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of isolation and distress, which can often be mistaken for loneliness. the individual describes a persistent feeling of being misunderstood and disconnected from others, frequently mentioning the effort required to maintain social interactions and the emotional toll it takes. despite the appearance of sociability, the underlying sentiment is one of exhaustion and despair. the references to unreciprocated communication, the facade of happiness, and the desire for a deeper connection suggest a struggle with self-worth and mental health. however, the emphasis on the lack of genuine connection and the overwhelming fatigue might indicate broader psychological issues beyond loneliness, such as depression or social anxiety. the narrative's complexity and the writer's explicit cry for understanding and relief highlight the need for comprehensive mental health support, rather than solely addressing loneliness."
"I have no idea of what??s going on in my lifeHi, I??m 24 &amp; I feel like 42 often, I really have no idea of what direction my life is charting in, I feel lost most times. I??m reaching out to anyone who might be interested in being a guide, mentor or advisor with a listening non judgemental ear.",0,"the narrative indicates a sense of confusion and lack of direction in life, which is not uncommon for someone in their mid-twenties. however, the individual is actively seeking help and reaching out for support, which suggests a level of social engagement and willingness to connect with others. the desire for a mentor or advisor implies that the person recognizes the value of relationships and is open to building them. these behaviors are not typical indicators of loneliness, as lonely individuals often withdraw and feel disconnected from others. the proactive approach to finding guidance shows an underlying optimism and a belief that support is available, further indicating that the person is not experiencing loneliness."
Anyone want to watch party stand up comedy on Amazon prime?I hope that I feel less lonely if someone else is watching with me while also alone. ...what have I become...,0,"the narrative reflects an individual's attempt to reach out for social connection through a shared activity, which is a healthy and proactive behavior. the person expresses a desire for companionship, indicating an awareness of their social needs and a willingness to address them. while there is a mention of feeling lonely, the tone suggests a temporary state rather than a chronic or deep-seated loneliness. the use of humor and the choice of a communal activity like a watch party imply an understanding of how to engage with others and seek enjoyment, which are positive signs of social functioning. the self-reflective question at the end indicates a moment of introspection rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. overall, the narrative showcases efforts to combat loneliness through social interaction and self-awareness, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
I Hate Who I Am[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a strong sense of self-loathing and frustration, which can be associated with various emotional and psychological struggles. however, it does not necessarily suggest loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or a longing for social interaction. in this narrative, the focus is primarily on self-perception and personal dissatisfaction rather than a desire for social connection or a sense of being cut off from others. while self-hatred can be a component of loneliness, it is not a definitive indicator on its own. thus, the absence of explicit references to social isolation or a craving for companionship supports the classification that the author may not be experiencing loneliness."
How can you stop yourself from being emotionally attached to persons who push you away?[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a concern about emotional attachment to individuals who are not reciprocating the same level of interest or affection. while this could be a sign of emotional distress, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the focus here is on managing personal feelings and boundaries rather than expressing feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. the individual is seeking advice on emotional regulation and self-preservation, which are common concerns in interpersonal relationships. the absence of explicit references to feelings of solitude, disconnection from others, or a desire for social interaction points towards a broader emotional challenge rather than loneliness specifically. this indicates a need for strategies to cope with rejection or unreciprocated attachment rather than a longing for companionship or social inclusion."
In dire need of a heartgasmnan,0,"the narrative ""in dire need of a heartgasmnan"" suggests a playful or whimsical tone rather than a serious expression of loneliness. the term ""heartgasmnan"" appears to be a creative, perhaps humorous, way of describing a desire for emotional excitement or romantic thrill. the use of ""dire need"" might imply urgency, but it lacks the deeper, more pervasive sense of isolation typically associated with loneliness. instead, it conveys a specific, situational desire for an intense emotional experience, which is not necessarily linked to a broader sense of social disconnection. the brevity and creativity of the phrase indicate a lighthearted approach rather than a cry for help or a reflection of chronic loneliness."
"I had my first conversation with my crush todayIt was more of a meme conversation that lasted 2-3 minutes, but I've never talked to her much so I just wanted to share because it made me really happy. I really hope we can become some sort of friends, even if it's just on the internet. Sorry if this seemed like a shitpost.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of joy and excitement stemming from a positive social interaction. the individual expresses happiness about a brief conversation with their crush, indicating an optimistic outlook and hope for future interactions. the desire to become friends, even if only online, suggests a proactive approach to building social connections rather than a sense of isolation. the casual tone and the apology at the end imply a level of self-awareness and a desire to share positive experiences with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative showcases an individual's engagement with social opportunities and a hopeful perspective on their social life."
THERAPY DISCORD SERVER - https://discord.gg/eubnbzy3t8[removed],0,"the narrative discusses a therapy discord server, which suggests a context of seeking and providing support within a community. the presence of an organized group setting implies access to social interactions and a support network, which are key factors in mitigating feelings of loneliness. the individual likely engages in conversations and activities with others who share similar experiences, fostering a sense of belonging and connection. these interactions can be crucial in developing and maintaining social bonds, which are essential for emotional well-being. the structured environment of a therapy server also indicates a proactive approach to mental health, further reducing the likelihood of experiencing significant loneliness. overall, the context and the elements of community and support in the narrative point towards a well-connected individual who is actively participating in social relationships."
"Evenings/nights are the worstEvery night I end up feeling super lonely to the point where I either end up on autopilot or keep doing uni work without stopping or even taking a break just so I don't have to think about anything else. It's exhausting and I'm struggling to cope, but I really don't have anything else to do:

1) Going out - Firstly, it's too expensive at the moment; secondly, it would only end up with me drinking alone because I physically cannot start conversations\*, it's different if someone comes up to me and starts one. Thirdly, I'm not a big drinker of alcohol anyway.

2)  Late Night Walks - It is far too cold for me to be doing that this time of year, it takes me literal hours to warm up from being freezing; it is currently 11:30 PM and 9??C (48??F) 

3) Watching TV, YouTube, etc. - I would usually do this, but my mind keeps wandering to how much better it would be if I had someone to watch it with as we cuddle, so now I can't even do this

\*I know what you're gonna say, ""Go to therapy"". Well, even though it'll probably be free (Yay NHS!), I just feel like there are people who need it more than I do, my problems aren't that bad. Plus, it'd feel disingenuous since it's their job and they get paid to care",0,"the narrative details a struggle with evening and nighttime loneliness, where the individual resorts to excessive university work to avoid confronting their feelings. they express a sense of exhaustion and a lack of alternatives, citing reasons such as the expense of going out, an inability to initiate conversations, and the cold weather preventing late-night walks. they also mention that watching tv or youtube is not enjoyable alone, as they yearn for companionship. despite recognizing that therapy might help, they downplay their own need for it, believing others have more pressing issues and feeling that seeking help might seem insincere. this narrative showcases several classic indicators of loneliness, such as a persistent sense of isolation, the struggle to find meaningful engagement, and the avoidance of confronting emotions directly. the individual's rationalization for not seeking therapy further highlights their internal conflict and self-deprecation, which are often associated with feelings of loneliness."
"NoneNo reason at all.

Sometimes, loneliness just hits you hard and there's nothing you can do about it.",0,"the narrative suggests a fleeting and generalized experience of loneliness, which is a common human emotion. the use of phrases like ""sometimes"" and ""just hits you hard"" indicates that the feeling of loneliness is not persistent or pervasive but rather sporadic and temporary. this kind of description aligns with typical, transient emotional states that many people experience from time to time. it lacks the depth and ongoing nature often associated with chronic loneliness, where individuals might describe prolonged periods of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a profound sense of being misunderstood. the absence of specific examples or detailed accounts of social disconnection further supports the interpretation that this is a momentary feeling rather than an enduring condition."
I want a hug[removed],0,"the narrative, ""i want a hug,"" suggests a simple, immediate desire for physical affection, which is a common human need. while it might initially appear to be a sign of loneliness, the brevity and directness of the statement do not provide enough context to confirm this. in many cases, individuals seek hugs for comfort, reassurance, or connection, but this does not necessarily indicate a deeper, persistent feeling of loneliness. it could be a response to a temporary situation or an expression of a basic emotional need rather than a chronic state of social isolation. without additional context or details about the individual's broader emotional state or social interactions, it is challenging to conclude that the person is experiencing loneliness solely based on this statement."
"Feel lost everytime I see someone I??m alright but almost immediately after I??m back to drained, alone, tired, sad, and angry meSucks ass",0,"the narrative expresses a range of emotions including feeling lost, drained, alone, tired, sad, and angry, which might initially suggest a sense of isolation or emotional distress. however, the brief mention of being ""alright"" when seeing someone indicates moments of social interaction or connection that provide temporary relief. the oscillation between feeling alright and then quickly returning to negative emotions may point to underlying issues such as stress, fatigue, or emotional volatility rather than chronic loneliness. the use of strong language and the intensity of emotions could also reflect frustration or a temporary state of mind rather than a persistent sense of loneliness. overall, while the narrative depicts significant emotional struggles, it lacks the consistent and pervasive sense of disconnection from others that is typically indicative of loneliness."
"Loneliness is driving me into fucking madness""you have to put yourself out there"" they say, yeah. fucking. right. What if I have already?
Is it always my fault that I'm lonely even if I always make the first fucking step, yeah... YEAH IT'S MY FUCKING FAULT ISNT IT? Even if I make the first move, I'm still at fault of being lonely, even if I'm being nice to others and really do try its still my fault that I'm lonely.

No wonder why people go on a rampage and it's only then when people feel bad and want to give the person a chance when they pass away after their rampage.",0,"the narrative expresses intense frustration and a sense of hopelessness about social interactions. the author feels that despite making efforts to connect with others, they are still blamed for their loneliness. this self-blame and perceived failure to form meaningful connections can be indicative of deeper emotional struggles. however, the tone of anger and externalizing blame suggests that the individual is not solely focused on their loneliness but also on the unfairness they perceive in social expectations. the reference to others' reactions only after tragic events hints at a broader societal critique rather than an introspective lament about personal loneliness. this broader focus and the intense emotional response might suggest that the narrative is driven more by frustration with societal norms than by an internalized sense of isolation."
Sad lonely depressed and heart brokennan,0,"the narrative contains words such as ""sad,"" ""lonely,"" ""depressed,"" and ""heartbroken,"" which are strong indicators of emotional distress. however, the brevity and lack of context in the narrative suggest it might be a generalized statement rather than a personal, in-depth account of loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include more detailed descriptions of their social environment, personal interactions, and specific events contributing to their feelings. the absence of such details here could imply that the narrative is more of an expression of momentary sadness or a general emotional state rather than a profound experience of loneliness. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the depth and specificity often associated with genuine loneliness."
Do you ever feel like your just gonna be lonely for the rest pf your lifeIf so how can i deal with it,0,"the narrative expresses a concern about feeling lonely for the rest of one's life and seeks advice on how to deal with such feelings. however, the question is posed in a hypothetical manner, suggesting that the author may be exploring the concept of loneliness rather than experiencing it intensely themselves. the use of ""if so"" indicates that the writer is considering a possibility rather than stating a current, ongoing experience. this can be seen as an inquiry into coping mechanisms for a potential future situation rather than an immediate cry for help. the narrative lacks personal anecdotes or descriptions of current emotional pain, which are often present in narratives written by individuals experiencing significant loneliness. instead, it appears to be a general question about loneliness, which might be indicative of curiosity or concern rather than a reflection of the writer's present emotional state."
My friend(s) left me again.This isn??t the first time.,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is experiencing a recurring situation where their friends have left them. while this might initially appear to be a sign of loneliness, the brevity and matter-of-fact tone of the statement lack the deeper emotional context typically associated with loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of sadness, isolation, or longing for connection, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative could imply a sense of resignation or acceptance of the situation, rather than an emotional struggle with solitude. the absence of explicit emotional distress or a desire for social interaction suggests that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness in the way it is clinically understood."
"How do you deal with anxiety regarding how lonely you are?I can??t fall asleep without having an existential crisis about the fact that my life will never be experienced by anybody else. Idk why this fact is so tough for me to digest. I wish I had some kinda significant other, or at least a really good friend that I could feel like we??re both in this together. But since that??s not the case (and won??t be for at least some time, due to external obstacles) I can??t help but feel these feelings of insignificance. Like this deeply painful melancholy.",0,"the narrative highlights feelings of anxiety and existential crisis, which are commonly associated with loneliness. the author expresses a desire for a significant other or a close friend to share their experiences, indicating a longing for connection and companionship. however, the mention of external obstacles preventing these connections suggests that the individual's feelings may be situational rather than chronic loneliness. the depth of their emotional pain and the struggle to find significance in their solitary experience are significant, but the context implies that these feelings might be transient and related to current life circumstances rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
"Free to chatHey, if anyone wants to chat this evening PM me. If your are lonely, sad or just need to talk!",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is open to social interaction and is offering support to others. the invitation to chat and the willingness to be there for people who might be lonely or sad indicates a proactive and empathetic stance. this behavior is generally associated with someone who is socially engaged and emotionally available, rather than someone experiencing loneliness themselves. the phrasing ""if anyone wants to chat"" implies a casual and friendly demeanor, not a desperate need for connection. overall, the context and tone of the message reflect a person who is extending a hand to others rather than seeking solace for their own loneliness."
"Being an Indian on the internet sucks.as soon as you say you are indian...they leave right in the middle. I hate it. where am I suppose to go when i am lonely?

Like for real what is the problem?",0,"the narrative reflects frustration and dissatisfaction with the experience of being an indian on the internet. the author mentions feeling rejected when revealing their nationality, which indicates a sense of being misunderstood or discriminated against. however, the narrative does not delve into deeper feelings of isolation or emotional pain that are often associated with loneliness. the author's focus is on the specific context of online interactions rather than a pervasive sense of disconnection from others. the question ""where am i suppose to go when i am lonely?"" appears more rhetorical and directed at the unfair treatment rather than an expression of genuine loneliness. this indicates that while the author is upset and perhaps feeling unfairly treated, they are not necessarily experiencing the broader, more persistent emotional state of loneliness."
"Doing a movie marathon alone is kinda boringI pulled out all my VHS tapes and vcr. Watching movies from childhood and a bunch of my old parents stuff which ive never seen.

So far. Watching every tape.i got.no matter what. 

Why? Idk just doing something",0,"the narrative describes an individual engaging in a movie marathon alone, expressing a sense of boredom rather than loneliness. the person mentions a lack of company to share laughs with, but this seems to be more about missing out on a shared experience rather than feeling isolated. the act of listing numerous movies watched and inviting others to chat about them suggests a desire for social interaction, yet the overall tone is more casual and lighthearted. this individual appears to be filling their time with a nostalgic activity and is open to connecting with others, indicating a sense of contentment and self-sufficiency rather than loneliness. the detailed recounting of movies and the effort put into watching them all also implies a level of engagement and enjoyment in the activity itself."
"I'm here, I'm alone and I always will be.As the title says, I am alone. I'm 36, and the only woman who ever payed attention to me left me in August of 2018. There was always a part of me that thought that I would end up this way and feared it. I always tried my best to always show love and compassion with everything that I've ever done. I never think of only myself, I honestly don't know how to. 

I've had brief conversations with people online, but it never fails that when I start developing feelings for that person, they always say that they don't feel the same way and I wind up with a broken heart, it's happened twice so far. People that I think that I can see a future with shatter me all over again. Of course I don't want them to know how deeply they've hurt me so I pretend everything is fine, even go as far to wish them luck in their ventures as I lay broken. I would never want to want them to feel hurt because they've broken my heart, but I'm so tired of giving my all to someone only to be met with rejection. Why can't anyone ever feel toward me what I feel toward them? 

I just moved into a new apartment and literally days afterward the quarantine happened. I've been shut off from pretty much all social contact. It's been so hard, I had a panic attack the other day because of all of this, the second one of my life. 

How many times can I do this? How many times can I give up pieces of myself until I'm empty? I love everyone, is it so hard for just person to love me back? Maybe I'm asking the impossible, maybe I should just resign myself to a life of longing and loneliness. Nihilism and I have never got along too well, but it could be time to become reacquainted. I don't want to suffer anymore and I don't know how to assuage that. 

Another thing, I'm tired of people telling me that I'm good looking or that I have a great personality. If either of those things were true life wouldn't be the way that it currently is. 

Thank you to whomever read my drunk ramblings. &lt;3 you guys.",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of isolation and emotional pain. the individual expresses feelings of perpetual loneliness and heartbreak, detailing experiences of unreciprocated love and repeated rejection. despite their efforts to show love and compassion, they struggle to form meaningful connections. the quarantine has exacerbated their isolation, leading to panic attacks and a sense of hopelessness. their self-worth is questioned, as they struggle to understand why others don't return their feelings. this constant cycle of giving and being met with rejection has left them feeling empty and resigned to a life of longing. they express a desire for love and connection but are overwhelmed by the repeated emotional pain. the narrative is a poignant depiction of someone grappling with profound loneliness and the emotional toll it takes on them."
"Linkin Park is the only thing that gets me through these lonely nights. Any LP fans?Well today is officially one month since the last time my ex girlfriend told me she loves me. In fact she blocked me and I haven't heard from her for nearly three weeks now. It's been extremely hard. The loneliness is nearly unbearable. I've come to love Linkin Park more than ever now though. I can relate to so many of their songs. I love Hybrid Theory, Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, and The Hunting Party. I'm also a big fan of Alice in Chains, even though I don't listen to them as much as I used to. Jar of Flies is one of my favorite albums ever. Anybody else here into rock? What do you listen to?",0,"the narrative expresses a deep appreciation for music, particularly linkin park and alice in chains, as a coping mechanism for difficult times. the mention of a recent breakup and the feelings of loneliness associated with it are evident. however, the narrative also shows a proactive attempt to engage with others by asking about their musical preferences, indicating a desire for social connection. this active outreach suggests resilience and an effort to combat feelings of isolation. while the individual acknowledges their loneliness, their engagement with music and attempts to connect with others reflect coping strategies that are typical of someone who is managing their emotions and seeking support, rather than being overwhelmed by loneliness."

I just want to rant.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author is frustrated about their friend consistently falling asleep during their chats. despite this frustration, the author shows understanding and empathy towards their friend's situation, acknowledging the long hours and exhaustion their friend must be experiencing. the author does not express feelings of isolation or a lack of social connection; instead, they seem to be venting about a specific circumstance. this indicates that while the author may be annoyed or disappointed, they do not exhibit the deeper emotional pain or sense of social disconnection typically associated with loneliness. the presence of a consistent communication partner, even if the interaction is cut short, suggests that the author does not lack social interaction or support."
VentWould like to vent everything in my heart,0,"the narrative ""ventwould like to vent everything in my heart"" suggests a desire to express emotions or thoughts that are currently being held inside. while the act of wanting to vent can sometimes be associated with feelings of loneliness, it is not an exclusive indicator. in this case, the narrative lacks specific elements that typically point to loneliness, such as expressions of isolation, a sense of being misunderstood, or a lack of meaningful connections with others. the brevity and general nature of the statement imply that the individual may simply be seeking a release or an outlet for their emotions rather than experiencing deep-seated loneliness. wanting to vent is a common and healthy way to manage stress and emotions, and without additional context pointing to social isolation or emotional disconnection, it does not necessarily indicate loneliness."
"29[M4F] Hows your night going?Looking for a friend who I can speak to all the time. Sometimes you just need somebody who you can talk to, about anything and everything.

Does effortless love exist?Where you don't need to try convince yourself that you want to stay? While it's actually because you're afraid to be lonely again,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of questioning and curiosity about the nature of love, particularly effortless love. the author is pondering whether such a form of love exists where one does not need to convince themselves to stay in a relationship out of fear of loneliness. this introspective query suggests a reflective state of mind rather than an immediate experience of loneliness. the focus is on understanding and exploring the dynamics of love and commitment, rather than expressing feelings of isolation or social disconnection. the narrative lacks direct indicators of loneliness, such as descriptions of feeling isolated, disconnected from others, or experiencing emotional pain due to a lack of social interactions. instead, it highlights a thoughtful consideration of relationship motivations, which is a normal aspect of human introspection and not necessarily tied to loneliness."

Is anyone else reading books to cope with how lonely they feel?Share your favorites so far!,0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking to connect with others through a shared interest in reading. the mention of feeling lonely is presented in a casual, almost communal way, suggesting the person is reaching out for companionship rather than expressing deep-seated loneliness. the request for favorite book recommendations indicates a proactive approach to finding common ground and fostering social interaction. this behavior is more characteristic of someone who is aware of loneliness but actively engaging in social strategies to mitigate it, rather than someone who is deeply entrenched in feelings of isolation. the tone and context imply a desire for connection and shared experiences, which are positive signs of social engagement rather than indicators of profound loneliness."
"Y'all know why I'm hereGot no one to talk to, if you wanna, dm me",0,"the narrative suggests a straightforward call for interaction, which can be interpreted as a normal desire for social engagement rather than a sign of deep loneliness. the brevity and casual tone imply a relaxed attitude towards seeking conversation. the use of ""y'all"" and ""dm me"" reflects a familiarity with social media culture, suggesting the individual is accustomed to online interactions. the absence of emotional language or expressions of sadness, isolation, or distress indicates that this is more of a casual outreach rather than a plea stemming from loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the depth and emotional cues typically associated with feelings of loneliness."
"Just needed to write it all downI've been in my room a whole week now. Due to the coronavirus we have been working from home since last friday. My ""office"" is a desk in one of the two wardrobes in my room. All of the jobs we had lined up for the summer have been cancelled because of the coronavirus so there is very little for me to do whilst sat at my desk.


I rent a room in a house with strangers. I have tried getting to know them all and offered hanging out etc but nothing ever comes of it. The 2 boys I live with just want to play their computer games and not really interact much. The girl I live with is never home so is a bit of a mystery to me. I've not seen or heard her at all since this coronavirus stuff has me indoors a lot. 


I moved here and broke up with my boyfriend who I lived with before. That was in November. 


Since then I have lost my closest friends because we were all part of the same friendship group. He moved in with some of them and their house is the place where they all hang out and have parties etc. I have seen my 2 ""best friends"" 3 times since we broke up. It has become so clear that they were never my friends but his.. the one that lives with him told me ""I want to invite you to things but he is going through a bit of a mental phase right now"". That is fine, I respect his space. It was my choice to break up.


For the sake of my mental health, I stopped drinking and doing any recreational drugs. I know it doesnt sound like a lot but I am 24 days sober and dont think I have been sober for that long since I started drinking as a teen. My ex and his friends all drink heavily and do drugs a lot. That's part of why I didnt really want to be together anymore because I didnt want that to be my life.


But now I'm so detached. I've been lonely like never before. I started seeing someone from work who moved to this city 6 years ago. He has a super close family and so many friends. He moved into this amazing place with his pals. And I'm so jealous. 


I've been here nearly 2 years. I know no one other than colleagues. I've made one real friend from my old job and now I'm starting to see that we aren't as close as I once thought either. My family all live hours away. 


Last weekend I wanted to go to my dads for the weekend but didn't. I don't know why not. I guess we aren't close enough for me to want to have done that.


The house my friends and ex moved into is so close to me. I keep trying to stalk my friend on strava to see exactly where they live but I cant work it out. I just want to walk past and see it but that's such an insane thing to do. I dont know why I started thinking that. 


I had started to try and meet new people through facebook groups and going to things regularly. Now this coronavirus has everyone staying home, I have no one again.


I have so much to do at home, I've got about a million hobbies lol. So the whole staying in thing is actually really good for me to develop my skills in those which I am grateful for. 


But fuckk this is so lonely and I feel numb. Without any social human interaction I can feel myself slowing down. I excersize every day and eat healthy but its other people I need. I miss everyone. I dont know how I'm going to go on like this for so long.  


I know everyone is in the same position and it's not going to last forever. I just wanted to tell someone what was going on with me.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has been staying in their room for a week due to the coronavirus lockdown, working from home with little to do. they live with strangers who are not interested in socializing, and they feel disconnected from their previous social circle after a breakup. despite attempts to make new friends and engage in hobbies, they express feelings of loneliness and detachment. they mention missing social interactions and feeling numb despite maintaining healthy habits. the narrative reflects a situation where the individual is struggling with isolation and the lack of meaningful connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. the expression of missing people and the difficulty in coping with prolonged isolation highlight the emotional toll of their current circumstances."
"????Her One.
The warmth of a hug. The feel of a cuddle. Something I dream of. So peaceful and settle. The feel of a kiss. The other palm against my hand. Waiting for what it will feel like to be truly loved by a man. The one I can hug and kiss to death. The one I will love so. The man I can shower in affection. Because his heart will be my home. My heart will race every time he looks at me. Beautiful butterflies will fill my soul. And if we have a height difference between us???.????????my heart will feel whole. It??s not just the beautiful moments where we watch Disney movies and cuddle with blankets and popcorn at our feet. But rather the moment where I can lay my head against his chest and listen to the sound of his heartbeat.??????It??s not just the beautiful moments we will create together in the future. The beauty of what awaits there. But thinking back and remembering how discouraged and how lost I felt. Losing myself to complete despair. 


Hope is never ever lost????. And when we feel as if it left us long ago. We have to trust that it never has.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of longing and romantic idealization, focusing on the warmth and affection that comes with a loving relationship. the author dreams of physical closeness, like hugs and cuddles, and describes these moments with vivid imagery. while there is a mention of past discouragement and despair, the overall tone is hopeful and anticipatory. the author expresses a belief in the future and the possibility of finding love, indicating a sense of optimism and resilience. the detailed envisioning of future happiness and the positive outlook suggest an emotional state that is more hopeful and forward-looking rather than consumed by loneliness."
"Forgot to turn off phone at movies, didn't matter.No one calls me (T.T)",0,"the narrative reflects a situation where the individual forgot to turn off their phone at the movies but notes that it did not matter because no one calls them. while this might initially suggest a lack of social interaction, the context does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the casual mention of forgetting to turn off the phone and the nonchalant tone suggest that the person is not significantly troubled by the absence of calls. it's possible that the individual has a balanced social life but is currently in a period where they are not expecting calls, or they might be comfortable with solitude. the use of humor, as indicated by the emoticon (t.t), also implies a level of emotional resilience and a lighter attitude towards the situation, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks deeper expressions of emotional distress or longing for connection that are commonly associated with loneliness."
"I wish she were hereI??m in a long distance relationship right now and I love my partner but it??s hard not being able to have her near me to cuddle, or kiss, or to have sex with. I talk to her the most out of the people I know and I feel like if we broke up I really wouldn??t have anyone to talk to.

It feels so lonely sometimes because when I go to sleep there??s no there to hold or cuddle. I miss her a lot. I don??t want to cheat but sometimes I really want someone to cuddle with or to kiss, or to feel their warm embrace. I??m so tired and I wish she was here.",0,"the narrative reflects a strong emotional bond and attachment to the partner, with the primary struggle being the physical distance rather than a lack of social connections or pervasive loneliness. the individual expresses love and a significant amount of communication with their partner, which suggests they have a meaningful relationship that provides emotional support. the yearning for physical closeness and the desire for intimate interactions are natural feelings in a long-distance relationship but do not necessarily indicate a deeper sense of loneliness. the concern about not having someone to talk to if the relationship ended highlights the importance of this specific relationship rather than an overall absence of social support. the longing for physical presence and intimacy is a common challenge in long-distance relationships, but the narrative does not suggest an overarching sense of isolation or loneliness beyond this context."
I don't know if I should keep trying.I'm only 20 but I've tried all my life to make friends and become more social. But it just hasn't happened for me. I think I'm probably just going to die alone. The idea really scares me and it makes me sad. But I'm starting to think I'm hopeless.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of struggle and despair, with the individual expressing feelings of hopelessness and fear about their social future. they mention trying throughout their life to make friends and become more social but feeling unsuccessful in these efforts. the fear of dying alone and the sadness it brings are clear indicators of distress. while these emotions and thoughts are intense, they may stem from a period of self-doubt or a temporary phase rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the individual is young and still exploring their social identity, which can involve experiencing such emotions. the mention of trying to make friends and being social indicates a proactive approach to combating loneliness, suggesting resilience and the potential for positive change."
"My ex of 2 years texted me today and I feel even more lonelier.She just sent me picture of a mug I gifted her maybe 5 years back and wrote: ""Found this. It's my new tea mug. Thank you!"" 

I barely ever receive any texts and receiving one from her just threw me back to the time when I wasn't struggling to get through a day. I wanted to talk to her more but tomorrow, I would be lonely again. And if I talked to her tonight, I won't be able to get through the day tomorrow. I will want more of her and I can't get that. 

I know many of you won't get it. And it's okay. I wouldn't be here if I had someone to text. I'll probably remove this post tomorrow. But at least for tonight, after this post, I might be able to sleep.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional response to an unexpected message from an ex-partner, which brings back memories of a happier time. the individual expresses a desire for more interaction but also acknowledges the pain that would follow, showing a level of self-awareness and emotional regulation. the mention of rarely receiving texts highlights a potential lack of social interaction, yet the narrative does not convey a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. instead, it focuses on the specific emotional impact of this single interaction and the person's ability to recognize and manage their feelings. the decision to possibly remove the post and the mention of sleeping better after expressing these thoughts suggest a momentary need for emotional release rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
23F Michigan US. Looking for chat and some funHi. I'm Mica. Bored and alone. add me on sc : Diazmica21,0,"the narrative presents a brief introduction of mica, a 23-year-old from michigan, who is looking for chat and some fun. while mica mentions being bored and alone, the tone and context suggest a casual and light-hearted approach to seeking social interaction rather than expressing deep feelings of loneliness. the use of ""bored and alone"" appears more situational and temporary rather than indicative of chronic loneliness. mica's proactive invitation to add her on snapchat suggests a desire for social engagement and connection, which is a positive social behavior. this proactive approach and the context of seeking casual fun rather than expressing emotional distress or isolation are typical indicators that mica is not experiencing significant loneliness."
Anyone around?Could use someone to talk to rn,0,"the narrative suggests a momentary need for social interaction, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper, persistent sense of loneliness. the phrase ""could use someone to talk to rn"" implies a temporary desire for companionship or support, which can be a normal, situational feeling. people often seek out others for conversation during moments of stress, boredom, or when they have something specific to discuss. this behavior is common and does not inherently point to chronic loneliness. the brevity and casual tone of the message further support the interpretation that the author is not experiencing an ongoing sense of isolation but rather a fleeting need for connection."
Looking for a friendIm kinda new to reddit. I miss talking to people or just having someone to talk to. I don't talk to anyone and I feel so alone. I'm on dating apps just to try and talk to someone but I'm really shy or unattractive so I don't make any friends on them. If anyone is out there who wants someone to talk to or just wants to talk to me id really appreciate having someone I can talk to. Im a 20 year old male if you care about that.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire for social interaction and companionship. the person expresses missing talking to people and feeling alone, which might typically indicate loneliness. however, there are no deeper expressions of emotional pain or prolonged isolation that are often associated with more profound loneliness. the individual is actively seeking connections through reddit and dating apps, showing a proactive approach to addressing their social needs. their shyness or self-perceived unattractiveness might hinder their success, but their efforts to reach out suggest they are not completely isolated. these actions imply a temporary situation rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the narrative shows a person in transition, actively seeking to improve their social interactions rather than being overwhelmed by loneliness."
"Need support
Lost my mom last week today her wake and funeral tomorrow just need someone to talk with.",0,"the narrative expresses a need for support following the recent loss of the author's mother, mentioning the wake and funeral as immediate concerns. this request for companionship and conversation in the face of grief is a natural response to bereavement rather than an indication of chronic loneliness. the focus is on the acute emotional distress caused by a significant life event, rather than an ongoing sense of isolation or lack of social connections. the specific mention of needing someone to talk with during this period highlights a situational need for emotional support rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness. typically, loneliness involves a more enduring sense of being disconnected from others, whereas this narrative reflects a temporary need for comfort and support in a time of mourning."
"I just woke up and I still feel like shitSo, i was feeling especially down today after school, so I took a nap. I woke up, and I still feel like shit. 
Oh well.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is feeling down and took a nap to alleviate their mood but woke up still feeling the same. while the individual expresses a sense of malaise, there is no indication of deeper, chronic loneliness. the language used is casual and lacks the depth of emotional isolation that often accompanies loneliness. the phrase ""oh well"" suggests a level of acceptance and resignation rather than the despair or longing for connection typical in lonely individuals. the absence of references to social relationships or a desire for companionship further supports the conclusion that this is a temporary state of feeling low rather than a symptom of loneliness."
20f Lonely but have a positive outlookJust want to find someone who cares,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for connection and acknowledges feelings of loneliness, but it is important to note the presence of a positive outlook. the individual is hopeful and actively seeking someone who cares, which suggests a proactive approach to overcoming their feelings. this optimism and forward-thinking attitude can be indicative of someone who is not deeply entrenched in loneliness. instead, they recognize their current emotional state and are taking steps to address it, which is a healthy and constructive response. the balance between acknowledging loneliness and maintaining a positive outlook indicates resilience and an underlying sense of well-being, which are not typically associated with chronic loneliness."
I??m lostI feel so alone every day I??m trapped inside my house. Every moment of everyday is spent thinking about how nice it would be for life to be over. I just want to end it so bad. I just want to sleep. I??m sick of having nothing.,0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of despair and hopelessness, which can be indicative of severe depression. phrases like ""i feel so alone every day"" and ""i just want to end it so bad"" suggest feelings of isolation and a desire to escape from their current state. however, the primary focus seems to be on the overwhelming desire to end life and the exhaustion from enduring their situation, rather than a specific longing for social connection or the pain of social isolation. while loneliness can be a component of depression, the narrative's emphasis on suicidal ideation and a pervasive sense of emptiness points more towards a severe depressive episode rather than loneliness as the primary issue."
Can??t think of oneDeadass been trying to think of who I can open up to even the slightest bit but can??t come up with anyone,0,"the narrative expresses a struggle to find someone to open up to, which might suggest a momentary difficulty in identifying a confidant rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the use of casual language and the term ""deadass"" indicates a conversational tone, possibly implying that the writer is sharing a temporary frustration rather than a chronic state of isolation. the inability to think of someone to confide in at this moment does not necessarily reflect an ongoing lack of social connections or support. it might simply be a situational feeling where the individual is currently unable to pinpoint a suitable person for sharing their thoughts. this suggests that the individual may generally have social connections but is experiencing a transient barrier to communication."
"ParadoxMost of the selfhelp ""how to talk to everyone/ anyone"" states that first impression is crucial, cutting time to make an impact with each new edition by couple of seconds. Fine, not trying to diminish the worth of the field. Work on yourself takes time and effort, also acknowleged. But. Nobody became the person needing help in a vacuum. Outside circumstances have a roll. Not all of them are changeable. Point? You need the interaction to up your self-confindence, you can't interact if you don't eradiete self-confidence.",0,"the narrative discusses the challenges of self-help advice, particularly in the context of making first impressions and building self-confidence. it acknowledges the effort required for self-improvement and the influence of external circumstances, emphasizing that not all factors are within one's control. the narrative reflects a rational and analytical perspective on self-help literature without expressing personal feelings of isolation or distress. the focus is on the logical critique of self-help methodologies rather than on personal experiences of loneliness. this objective analysis and the absence of emotional language related to loneliness suggest a mindset that is more concerned with understanding and addressing practical issues rather than seeking emotional connection or expressing a sense of being alone."
"Went to an A Day TO Remember concert by myself...I drove two hours from my home to the city where the venue was at. And then I went to the venue 3 hours early to gaurantee me to be in the front to see one of my favorite bands. There were some geniuses like me who were waiting very early too. 

One of them noticed my My Her Academia lanyard and started to converse with me about anime and such. Next thing I knew, I was conversing with the whole group of people waiting to see ADTR hours before the entrance opens. I was surprisingly making them laugh, I didn't have to hide or fake anything about myself and they were extremely nice people who love anime, gaming, and ADTR (and music similar to that) like me. They honestly gave me these best friend vibes even though I barely just met them.

We ended being in the front row together and it was an extremely fun show. I did get their social medias so we can keep in touch someday. It just sucks that they all live so far away and I probably may never get to see them again...

Everything here in my hometown sucks. People hate me and treat me like shit for little to no reasons. I've just had a shitty social life for pretty much all my life and I don't really have friends at the moment. I just wish I can move out and see those people again or meet more people similar to them. But they don't really have rock/metal concerts here in my area since shows like that don't sell well. I'm convinced that I'm just living in the wrong area and I'll meet people that I can feel genuinely comfortable with once I get the opportunity to move away someday.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who experienced a positive and engaging social interaction at a concert, despite initially attending alone. they found common interests with others, such as anime and music, and felt a genuine connection, even obtaining social media contacts to keep in touch. while they express dissatisfaction with their current social environment and a desire to relocate to a place with more like-minded individuals, the positive experience at the concert and the proactive steps to maintain new connections indicate an overall sense of social competence and optimism. these aspects suggest that the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness, as they are capable of forming meaningful social interactions and hold hope for future connections."
"Just really going through it right now
Went on a few dates with a girl I work with. Unfortunately things just didn??t work out. I didn??t make a move really on the first two dates, because of work situation, and when we got to the 3rd I felt like she just asked me out to put me in the friend zone based on the hints in the conversation.

I tired for a 4th date, but she turned me down when I tried to follow up on a 4th date by inviting her roommates, and then said she ignored my text and said she was tired when the time of the date came.

I??ve decided to just start ignoring her and our group chat. I really like her, but I have enough friends that I barely keep up with, and conversing with her hurts knowing that it??s not going to happen. 

I??ve been focusing on lifting, yoga, and running. Those are the things that make me feel at least a little happy, even if it??s only for a few hours. 

But at night when I have nothing to do but sit in my room. I feel absolutely terrible. I??ve had trouble sleeping as well over the past two weeks and I just awake sad.

Yeah I know I sound silly getting attached so quickly, but we did know each other for a while at work. It??s been a long time since I??ve had a girlfriend, and this whole summer when I was out doing stuff I just wished I had a partner by my side to share the moments with. 

Basically I??m just sad, and I??ve been really going through it the two weeks. Sucks I got so attached so quickly. No contact is going to be rough. My friends have tried to get me to open up about it, but I don??t think I can talk about it without tearing up.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual experiencing a temporary period of sadness and disappointment due to a failed romantic pursuit. although the person describes feelings of sadness, particularly at night and difficulty sleeping, these emotions are contextualized within the specific situation of the failed dates and unreciprocated romantic interest. the individual also mentions having a social circle and friends who are supportive and willing to listen, which indicates a level of social connectivity and support that typically mitigates feelings of loneliness. they also engage in activities such as lifting, yoga, and running, which provide moments of happiness and suggest active coping mechanisms. the desire for a partner to share experiences with over the summer hints at longing for companionship, but this is not uncommon and does not necessarily equate to loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a situational sadness rather than chronic loneliness, characterized by temporary emotional distress rather than pervasive feelings of isolation."
Lonely can chatI'm 23m and alone for now.  I'm here for 1 hour if anyone wants to have a chat,0,"the narrative indicates that the individual is currently alone but does not necessarily suggest a deeper sense of loneliness. the person mentions being alone ""for now,"" which implies a temporary state rather than a chronic feeling of isolation. the invitation to chat for an hour shows a proactive approach to seeking social interaction, suggesting they are open and willing to connect with others, which is not typical of someone experiencing loneliness. additionally, there is no expression of emotional distress or feelings of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. the straightforward and casual tone further supports the interpretation that the individual is simply seeking temporary companionship rather than expressing a deeper emotional need."

"Haven??t been hugged by someone other than family in a whileMy boyfriend and I can??t see each other outside of school right now due to circumstances. I have a very touchy love language when I want to be touched. I crave affection. Especially romantically. I haven??t actually hung out with him in 5 months.

"Any girl looking to be emotionally dependent?I am Maddy, 26, from India. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have never been able to function properly being lonely.

Please PM me if u want. :-)",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is openly seeking emotional support and connection due to personal struggles with depression and anxiety. while the person mentions loneliness, the focus is on their proactive approach to finding companionship and support. the desire for emotional dependence and reaching out for connection can be seen as a coping mechanism rather than an indicator of deep-seated loneliness. the tone, though reflective of vulnerability, shows an active pursuit of solutions and engagement with others, which suggests a level of social functioning and initiative that may not align with typical indicators of profound loneliness. the individual’s willingness to reach out and express their needs publicly indicates a level of social interaction and hopefulness that contrasts with the isolation and withdrawal commonly associated with loneliness."

\&gt; twitter .com /star\_shine0303",0,"the narrative displays a strong expression of anger and a desire to take drastic actions against perceived evil in the world. while the tone is aggressive and concerning, it lacks the typical indicators of loneliness such as feelings of isolation, sadness, or longing for connection. instead, the focus is on an external target and a sense of mission or purpose, albeit a negative one. the use of exclamation marks and the inclusion of a twitter handle suggest an attempt to engage with others or provoke a reaction, which contrasts with the withdrawn or introspective nature often seen in narratives of lonely individuals. thus, the narrative does not align with the common psychological markers of loneliness."
you all are fucking retards[removed],0,"the narrative exhibits a high level of aggression and hostility, which can often be a defense mechanism or an expression of frustration. however, it lacks the introspective and reflective qualities that are commonly associated with loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, sadness, or a longing for connection. in contrast, this narrative's aggressive tone and use of derogatory language suggest a different underlying issue, such as anger or contempt towards others, rather than a sense of personal loneliness. the absence of any mention of personal emotions, experiences of isolation, or desire for social interaction further supports the interpretation that the author is not expressing loneliness in this instance."
Why does it always have to get bad when I??m home alone? (TW?: Vent)[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a temporary emotional reaction to being home alone rather than a chronic sense of loneliness. the use of the phrase ""always have to get bad"" indicates a pattern of discomfort or distress, but it doesn't necessarily imply a deeper, pervasive loneliness. the writer's focus seems to be on situational triggers rather than an underlying sense of isolation. the mention of ""home alone"" might hint at situational anxiety or a negative association with solitude, but it lacks the depth and persistent yearning for social connection typically seen in narratives of loneliness. the absence of more detailed expressions of longing for companionship or a sense of being disconnected from others supports the classification. this reaction could be more aligned with situational distress or anxiety rather than a chronic experience of loneliness."
"Late Night Voice Chat?It??s pretty late. I have like no friends to talk to. Ppl on here who have added me are offline. I??m on discord if anyone wants to talk,,, about anything really. ",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is seeking late-night conversation on a platform like discord. while they mention having no friends to talk to and that people who have added them are offline, this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it is possible that they are simply looking for casual interaction at an odd hour, which is not uncommon. the use of ""if anyone wants to talk"" suggests an openness to social engagement rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the tone does not convey a profound emotional distress or a sense of disconnection from meaningful relationships, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a momentary desire for companionship that is situational and not indicative of a chronic state of loneliness."
What the fuck is going on?fuckingtalktome,0,"the narrative exhibits a strong sense of frustration and urgency, which might initially suggest distress, but it lacks the deeper context typically associated with loneliness. there are no mentions of feelings of isolation, longing for companionship, or descriptions of social disconnection. instead, the language used indicates a demand for immediate attention or communication, which could stem from various sources of frustration or anger rather than loneliness. the absence of any reference to personal relationships, emotional pain linked to solitude, or a sense of being excluded from social interactions further supports the classification. the direct and aggressive tone points more towards an acute situational reaction rather than an ongoing emotional state of loneliness."
"HiyaAnother night of 3 hours in front of my laptop before work. I hope everyone out there is having a happy night. Im not that interesting but if anyone ever needs an ear, Im usually around, hence my being in this group. I know as I read posts here there is a lot of negativity but hopefully people feel better after venting and realize there is a path there,some of us just get lost more easily walking on it. Have a good night even if youre by yourself.",0,"the narrative suggests a sense of community and empathy towards others. the author expresses a desire to support and listen to others, indicating social engagement and a willingness to connect. they acknowledge the presence of negativity but frame it in a positive light, suggesting that venting can be therapeutic and that there is a path forward. the mention of spending time in a group and hoping for others' happiness reflects an outward focus rather than an inward sense of isolation. the tone is generally hopeful and considerate, emphasizing shared experiences and understanding rather than personal despair or loneliness. the closing remark, ""have a good night even if you're by yourself,"" shows a recognition of solitude but not necessarily loneliness, as it carries a supportive and reassuring message."
You ever just want to really start somewhere fresh but not run away from ur problems just get new friends and a new life?Was in a long relationship and all I can say is it ruined me really hard. It took so much of my dignity away that I cannot be me anymore in this town. I lost a lot of friends and don??t have anyone like I used to and I just want new friends and a new life. Nothing here for me anymore and I??m going crazy sitting in this smal town where all I can think about is him. Anyone have suggestions when they feel like this? When they want to meet new people but it??s so hard?,0,"the narrative describes a person who feels a strong desire to start fresh and make new friends after a painful breakup. they express feelings of being ruined and losing their dignity, which has led to a sense of not being able to be themselves in their current town. they mention losing many friends and feeling isolated, but the focus is on the proactive desire to find new connections and build a new life. this suggests a drive to change their circumstances rather than a deep-seated sense of loneliness. their request for suggestions on meeting new people indicates an openness to social interaction and a willingness to take steps to improve their situation, which are not typical indicators of profound loneliness. instead, these elements reflect a situational struggle and a proactive approach to overcoming it."
"MisconceptionsSo... I don??t mean any part of this in a bragging way but I used to think that if you were attractive that??s all you had to do to find love, well I know I??m not ugly that??s for sure but it doesn??t mean anything, I??m so single and overlooked it??s like a sickness, I decided I??d post about it after my third suicidal attempt, I??m deeply unsure of what to do at this point I??m just spiraling down...down...down any advice is more than welcome",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of distress and confusion regarding the correlation between physical attractiveness and the ability to find love. the author expresses feelings of being overlooked and single despite believing they are not unattractive. this misconception has led to significant emotional turmoil, evidenced by the mention of multiple suicidal attempts and a sense of spiraling downward. while these emotions are intense and indicative of severe psychological distress, they do not necessarily point to loneliness specifically. the narrative focuses more on the frustration and hopelessness related to unmet romantic expectations rather than the broader social isolation or lack of meaningful connections that typically characterize loneliness."
20 m4f looking for someone to fall asleep with 18+Just sleepy,0,"the narrative suggests a straightforward and casual request for companionship without deeper emotional undertones. the phrase ""looking for someone to fall asleep with"" implies a desire for physical closeness or comfort, which is a common social need but doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the use of ""just sleepy"" further reinforces the idea that the primary motivation is related to sleep rather than an emotional void. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of meaningful connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the tone appears light and practical, focusing on a specific, situational need rather than a chronic emotional state. this context suggests that the individual's request is more about fulfilling a basic human need for companionship at a particular moment rather than addressing a deeper sense of loneliness."
"No one is ever going to want me.I'm 23 and have never even held the hand of a significant other.

People often disparage me because I complain about being alone, they tell me there's more to life than being in a relationship, but i disagree.

I live a very simple life, and have nothing else I want other than a wife, someone to love and someone that loves me.

I'm happy at times, but a piece is missing, and that causes me so much pain that it's unbearable.

Why am I cursed to be unloved?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who expresses a deep desire for companionship and a significant other, which is a common human longing. the person describes a sense of incompleteness and pain due to the absence of a romantic relationship, yet acknowledges moments of happiness. this indicates an awareness of other aspects of life that bring joy, even if they feel overshadowed by their primary desire. the individual also notes societal responses to their complaints about loneliness, suggesting they have some social interactions and are not entirely isolated. the intense focus on romantic relationships as the sole source of fulfillment can be seen as a narrow perspective rather than an overall state of loneliness. the narrative shows a struggle with unmet desires rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness affecting all areas of life."
"Struggle builds character, supposedly. TW: Trauma Dump. [M23].I feel like my entire life is a never ending game of whack a mole. Whenever I deal with one thing, something else comes up. COVID hit and I was forced to be alone with my thoughts. I wasn't particularly social before COVID, but I had to be. I had to go to university and socialize. I had a reason to get out of bed, get dressed and go somewhere. Then, I had no reason whatsoever. I'd get up, attend my lectures on Zoom, fall back asleep. My eating habits were horrible, I'd barely eat. I smoked a lot, a pack a day maybe. Cried myself to sleep every night. I was so unhappy with myself. 

Things started looking a little better (pandemic wise) after a few months. I had lost whatever social confidence I had within me after things went back to ""normal"". Case numbers were going down, restrictions were getting less extreme. I was able to see my friends more regularly. My friends are sort my go to, as opposed to my family. My anxiety was getting worse, though. It would spike when I'd go out, before going out, and even after going out. My panic attacks were worse. I wouldn't cry before, when I'd get a panic attack. Then, I started to cry. Barely being able to breathe + having a stuffy nose is a bad combination. I felt weak, I felt like I was a burden to anyone that I'd talk to.

It stayed that way for a while. I was depressed. I went to a psychiatrist and a therapist. Didn't feel like I was getting better. If anything, I was more bothered by the fact that I was taking medication to suppress whatever it was that was bothering me in my environment. I was not tackling the issue head on, I was merely putting on a band-aid and had managed to convince myself that things were getting better. They weren't. I stopped taking the anti-depressants.

I got diagnosed with Vitiligo shortly afterwards. It started to develop around my hands, and around my lips. A few random spots around my body. You can't really see the patches around my lips, unless you look closely. The ones on my hands are obvious. It stopped, but the dermatologist had told me that there's no way of knowing whether or not it'd get worse. No way of knowing how fast or slow it would spread. Someone who overthinks as much as I do doesn't do well with unpredictable diseases that have no cure. As you can imagine, my anxiety got worse after learning that.

Now I'm just on autopilot. I've lost control of the reigns. I'm just on the ride, seeing where it takes me. I'm slowly feeling weaker and weaker. I yearn to be alone and not feel lonely. I can't seem to get my life together. I need to start looking for a job. I need to start creating objectives. I'm just so tired all the time. I'm hopeful, still. I hope that things will get better. I'm hopeful that I'll meet a guy who'll tell me how to make a day go by. Someone to fall in love with. Be there for me, and I for him. Till then, I guess I'll see how things go. Thank you for reading the entire thing, really. I appreciate it, and I hope you're okay.",0,"the narrative reflects a deeply challenging period marked by numerous personal struggles, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, deteriorating mental health, and the onset of vitiligo. despite the detailed recounting of hardships and the evident distress, there are subtle but significant indicators that point away from a profound sense of loneliness. the narrator mentions having a support system, notably friends who they can rely on, which suggests some level of social connection and interaction. while they express feelings of anxiety, depression, and exhaustion, they also display a degree of resilience and hope for the future, such as the desire to meet someone special and the acknowledgment of a need to set objectives. these aspects, combined with the fact that they actively sought professional help and continue to hold onto hope, suggest a complex emotional state that, while certainly troubled, does not solely hinge on loneliness. the presence of social ties and a forward-looking perspective are crucial elements that differentiate their experience from one characterized primarily by loneliness."
"To those who need itAs terrible as your life seems right now, it will get better. It??s a little more difficult this year because of Covid, but we will prevail. There are people out there who care about you, even if you don??t think so. Cherish those people who are close to you and make you feel comfortable. And if you feel like you??re gonna be lonely the rest of your life, I promise that??s not the case. There??s a number of things that can help your situation, with your mental state being the priority. If you practice healthy habits, it can improve your mental state, eventually making you a happier person. You shouldn??t even have to worry about being lonely because there??s so many people in the world who would love to get to know you. Many people would be happy to talk to you if you??re genuinely happy and comfortable in your own skin.

I know it??s not easy to do things to ??magically make you happy?? but it??s a journey to improving yourself (remember to practice self-love) with a hard-earned reward to get even a few quality people in your life. Because it??s better to have people who are there for you instead of inflating your ego with many acquaintances (who tend to be shallow individuals).

Sorry for the long post... Thanks for reading!",0,"the narrative reflects a positive and supportive tone, offering encouragement and practical advice to those who may be feeling down or lonely. the author emphasizes the importance of mental health and self-improvement, suggesting that practicing healthy habits can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life. the focus on cherishing close relationships and the reassurance that there are people who care indicates a perspective of someone who is not currently experiencing loneliness. the narrative also highlights the value of genuine connections over superficial acquaintances, which suggests a level of social awareness and emotional stability. overall, the narrative is characterized by an optimistic outlook and a belief in the potential for positive change, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"The songs I listen to.. Are not ment for me...Its ment for the real people with emotions worth protecting and fighting for or against. 

Im not worth it.. I am anger. I am hate. I am done.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of anger and self-worthlessness, but these emotions do not necessarily equate to loneliness. the individual discusses a sense of detachment from the music they listen to, feeling that it is meant for ""real people"" with valuable emotions, which suggests a struggle with self-esteem rather than a lack of social connection. the repeated declarations of being ""anger"" and ""hate"" indicate intense internal conflict, but there is no mention of isolation or a longing for social interaction. instead, the focus is on personal emotional turmoil, which can exist independently of loneliness."
"Even if everyone in your life thinks you??re terrible, to 99.9% of the world you??re still a blank slate[deleted]",0,"the narrative reflects a philosophical viewpoint on self-perception and the perception of others. it suggests that no matter how negatively one is viewed by those around them, the vast majority of people in the world remain unaware and indifferent to one's existence. this perspective indicates a certain level of detachment and resilience rather than loneliness. there is no mention of emotional pain, longing for connection, or isolation which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative implies a broader, more abstract contemplation of identity and societal judgment, which does not inherently point to feelings of loneliness. the tone lacks the emotional depth and personal context that often accompany narratives of loneliness, suggesting that the author is more focused on a generalized observation rather than expressing personal distress or a desire for social connection."
"I will never find a girlfriendI met a girl online on this dating app called ""Lovely"". I gave her my number and asked if she wants to chat more we could. She could for 1 minute yesterday. She sounds cute but she said she has to go and she just wanted to talk to me for a little. Today I text her and told her if she ever need anyone to talk to I'm always near my phone. She didn't reply and I'm worried. I want her to know that I'm attracted to her but I don't know when or how to say it. I know I know. We just met each other but I want to talk to her I'm scared to call her. Btw im 18 and shes 17 I'm probably not her type :( 

I migh as well cut myself and be deppressed allday cause I will never feel love from a girl :(",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently met someone online and is eager to establish a deeper connection. the person expresses anxiety and self-doubt about the interaction, worrying about the lack of response and feeling uncertain about how to communicate their feelings. despite the evident emotional turmoil and self-deprecating thoughts, the narrative does not strongly indicate pervasive loneliness. instead, it reflects common experiences of young individuals navigating early romantic interests and facing typical uncertainties and insecurities. the focus on a specific interaction and the immediate emotional response to it, rather than a broader sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections, suggests that the individual may be more focused on this particular situation rather than experiencing a deeper, more chronic sense of loneliness."
Someone start a conversationSorry but hi and hey is no fun im bored at work with nothing to do,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of boredom and a desire for engagement, particularly in a work setting where the individual feels unoccupied. the use of casual language such as ""hi"" and ""hey"" suggests a relaxed approach to initiating conversation rather than a deeper emotional need. the expression of being ""bored at work"" indicates situational dissatisfaction rather than an ongoing emotional state of loneliness. the individual’s primary concern appears to be the lack of stimulating activities rather than a lack of meaningful connections or emotional support. this context points more towards a temporary state of ennui rather than the persistent and pervasive feelings typically associated with loneliness."
"What do friends even do anyway?I haven't had a proper friend in years, and even before then my relationships with others were fading. Now, I want to have friends again, or at least, I think I do. But I have no idea what friends even do anymore, nor how to actually make one. I'm 18, fyi. I can't be the only one with this problem, right?",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of confusion and curiosity about friendship, stemming from a long period without close relationships. while the individual acknowledges a desire to reconnect and form new friendships, there is a distinct lack of emotional distress or feelings of deep isolation that typically accompany loneliness. the person is seeking understanding and seems open to learning and engaging with others, rather than expressing despair or hopelessness. their query about whether they are alone in their experience also suggests a level of self-awareness and a proactive approach to their social situation, which are not common indicators of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a transitional phase rather than a state of loneliness."
"Found the purpose in lifeIt??s just to spend time in a way that it??ll feel fast until you die. But I found a cool cheat code, it??s called pills and vodka.",0,"the narrative reflects a nihilistic outlook on life, suggesting a sense of purposelessness and a desire to make time pass quickly. however, the mention of using ""pills and vodka"" as a ""cheat code"" to speed up time indicates a coping mechanism for dealing with life's perceived meaninglessness rather than loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often express feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, and a desire for social interaction, none of which are evident in this narrative. instead, the focus here is on escapism and substance use, which can be indicative of other psychological issues such as depression or existential despair, but not necessarily loneliness."
"Got rejected again.Except this time I don't even have friends to talk to about it.

I'm clearly going to die alone.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of rejection and despair, but these sentiments do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author mentions not having friends to talk to about their rejection, which could be a situational feeling rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the phrase ""i am clearly going to die alone"" reflects a moment of hopelessness and fear of future loneliness, but it is more indicative of an immediate emotional response rather than an ongoing condition. it is important to differentiate between transient feelings of isolation due to specific events and a persistent sense of loneliness that permeates daily life. the narrative lacks consistent indicators of long-term loneliness, such as a pervasive sense of emptiness, chronic lack of social interaction, or deep-seated feelings of disconnection from others."
"I keep pushing people away.I don't understand why I do it. I don't think I am a misanthrope, I *fantasize* about having a real bond with someone. I don't have anybody I can call a friend, I push them away a long time ago, they left because I suck at being a friend.

I had a chance to be with someone new, I met him online, I liked him, I felt like was like me. I just decided to ghost him and I can't bring myself to talk with him again.

I suck, I'll die alone.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is struggling with interpersonal relationships and exhibits self-deprecating thoughts. they mention pushing people away and feeling incapable of maintaining friendships, which are behaviors often associated with loneliness. however, despite these struggles, the narrative also reveals an awareness of their actions and a desire for genuine connection, as seen in their fantasies about bonding with someone and their initial positive feelings toward a new acquaintance. the internal conflict and self-awareness suggest that the individual might be dealing with issues related to self-esteem or social anxiety rather than loneliness itself. the fact that they have had opportunities to connect but chose to withdraw could indicate a fear of vulnerability or rejection rather than a fundamental sense of isolation."
"Looking for a genuine friend (platonic). I'd appreciate it if you could upvote but you don't have to.Tbh I haven't had a friend since high school (unless you count my dog haha). I have social anxiety, so I tried making friends online. Nevertheless, it seems extremely hard to find a real friend since the convos tend to die out after a few messages. Besides, I always felt like the I was the one carrying the conversation. It'd be great if I could find a meaningful connection, not just chatting about some random topics. I am into reading, philosophy, animals, tv shows, sports and puzzles. I turned 21 last week btw. Feel free to send a Dm if you wanna be friends. No nsfw stuff btw.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for genuine platonic friendship and highlights past struggles with social anxiety and maintaining conversations. the mention of not having a friend since high school, except for a pet, suggests some level of social isolation. however, the individual shows proactive behavior by seeking connections online and expressing clear interests such as reading, philosophy, animals, tv shows, sports, and puzzles. the upbeat tone, humor about the dog, and openness to new friendships indicate a positive outlook and resilience. the person's proactive efforts to overcome social anxiety and their clear communication about boundaries also suggest a level of self-awareness and emotional stability, which are not typical indicators of deep loneliness. instead, these aspects reflect a person who is socially cautious but hopeful and actively engaged in improving their social life."
Sick of ChristmasI so dn wish this Christmas can be over with. I just can't handle it.,0,"the narrative expresses a strong dislike for christmas and a desire for the holiday season to end quickly. while this sentiment could be interpreted as a sign of stress or frustration, it does not inherently indicate loneliness. many people experience heightened stress during the holidays due to various reasons such as financial pressures, family dynamics, or personal expectations. the narrative lacks specific references to feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on an aversion to the holiday itself, suggesting that the individual's feelings are more related to situational factors rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness."
"You ever wish someone had you in their thoughts as much as you had them? But only to realise they just don??t really care about you?It??s normal. There??s nothing wrong with someone not caring about you. They just don??t. But then you realise if only you were a certain type of way that interests that person. That if something impossible to change about you COULD change that brings their attention as they have for others. Man. Breaks my heart sometimes. And I??m not necessarily speaking about a partner in life. It could be anyone. If only I morphed in a type of way that made them happier. Maybe I won??t be so lonely. But then again why does it have to take that much? What is wrong with an individual that they have to change for others. It??s not right for it to be this way :( whatever. Just have zero love in my heart. I??m not looking for any ??text?? comfort. If you want to though, just comment a ??????.

Thanks for reading. I love you",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of longing for reciprocal care and attention, along with a recognition of the pain that comes from feeling unvalued by others. the author reflects on the desire to change themselves to gain acceptance and love, which can be a common feeling among individuals. however, there is also a clear acceptance of the situation and an understanding that it is not right to have to change oneself for others. the author ends with a seemingly contradictory statement of love, which may indicate a complex emotional state but does not necessarily point to loneliness. the request for a simple comment rather than emotional support suggests a level of self-sufficiency and perhaps a coping mechanism that doesn't rely on deep emotional connections. overall, while the narrative contains elements that could be associated with loneliness, such as the desire for mutual care and the pain of feeling unappreciated, the tone and context indicate a level of acceptance and resilience that suggests the individual may not be experiencing profound loneliness."
It??s my birthday lol and I??m alone and decided to work so I can at least spend my time with strangers then myself...And currently crying in a Starbucks line missing my ex and wishing my best friend were to be here and just feeling so alone...,0,"the narrative reflects an individual spending their birthday alone, choosing to work to avoid solitude, and expressing sadness and longing for their ex and best friend. while these elements suggest feelings of sadness and isolation, the context of choosing to be among strangers and seeking out a public place like starbucks indicates an attempt to engage with the outside world. this behavior suggests a coping mechanism rather than a deep-seated state of loneliness. the act of crying and missing loved ones is a natural emotional response to a significant day rather than a chronic condition of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects temporary feelings of sadness rather than a persistent state of loneliness."
"36 [M4F] Norway, looking for a connection of some kind.I am not going to write a lengthy post since I am a bit unsure of what I am looking for and if this is the right place.

I am a bit complicated as a person, and as much as I like to believe I am looking for that special someone I am not exactly sure how that is going to happen, but you never know right?

First and foremost I am often sleepless and bored, I have been through a lot and maybe it would be nice to have a conversation with someone every now and then. But then again, I am not super social and chatty by nature. I am a reserved person in many ways, and somehow also the most demonic assclown you have ever met.(Yeah I know, I dont even make sense to myself most of the time)

Blargh, there is so much to say but my thumb hurts just thinking about it. Im just gonna throw some random things out there and leave it at that:

I am not easy to categorize or put in a box, frustratingly so.

Been through more than most, and in different ways you might think.

And I am a very dark person by nature, but people seemingly find me hilarious.

I like long walks at night, animals, books, playing music, science and murder people who eat pineapple on pizza.

I think that does it for now, here is a few pictures btw.(bonus catpics, his name is Purrzum and has a catnip problem)

"what's the point of everything?I never felt like someone actually cared about me. Besides the people who blatantly played my emotional weaknesses, others seemed to be nice until suddenly (at least to me) they stopped being nice. Just like they milked me enough and wanted to get rid of me.

I hoped I would get to interact more with other people now (online of course) since everyone is forced to stay home, but it's even worse than before, what's left for me is sleeping too much, doing some work, criticizing myself for sleeping too much, playing LoL or overwatch the with 1-3 people who sometimes join me in Discord and then try to sleep again.

Meanwhile other people seem to have fun mentioning their friends in Instagram stories or doing video calls with multiple people, I don't seem to be one of these friends. I think I get more notifications from Duolingo than I get from the so-called 'social media'. My WhatsApp conversations feel like a wasteland. Even worse when it comes to females. I have zero female people I'm in regular contact with. It hurts.

I wish I could at least use this time to do the things I wanted to do: read, learn more French, educate myself in psychology, but I don't even feel like doing that anymore. I'm just wasting time instead. A small part of me is hoping that our current society gets destroyed by the virus so that the people who survive can re-build everything on reasonable grounds.

Why do I have such radical thoughts? Probably because I've realized (other people of course may have other opinions) that we'd rather hold on to shallow, imaginary concepts than solving the real issues.
Not only our leaders, but millions of people are rather interested in the economy, the stock market, in God and religion. All of these things are made up by humans. Humans are just lucky that they subjugated the Earth. We would never be able to destroy the Earth though, only ourselves. 

This makes me sick. Combined with the pain I've suffered in the last years, it made me scream at my mother and brother yesterday. My mother hurt me so much by, in a combined effort with my father who's not living with us anymore, ruining the only serious relationship I had in my entire life. I never told her that and even yesterday, when I screamed unspeakable things to her, she didn't seem to care about what she did.

My brother is a thankless bastard. He only learned to take things, not giving anything back. That behavior dramatically increased because, although he's younger than me, he was my parents' favorite child. Even now my mother is doing everything to give him what he wants while I've been voluntarily working for years to stand on my feet by running a decent online business, almost finishing my university studies and organizing almost everything in my life on my own. 
My brother happily takes anything I'm sharing with him, including my Spotify or Netflix account. But he never (literally) shares anything with other people. I could say many more things but it seems clear to me that he's got a very distorted opinion on what a family should be like.

People say 'if you see one asshole in the morning, that's an asshole but if you see assholes all day, you're the asshole'. Maybe I am. And everyone would probably agree on that. 'Look how you screamed at your poor mother dude!', that's what most people would think. 
Part of me wants to apologize for screaming and swearing. But then, what's the point? I don't see any point. 

I'm just stuck here for the next weeks. Maybe I'm even in the wrong sub because I'm not really lonely. Sadness and great rage are with me most of the time.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of frustration, disillusionment, and emotional pain. the author describes feeling misunderstood and mistreated by those around them, including family members. despite these negative emotions, the narrative includes interactions with others, such as playing games with people on discord and maintaining an online business. these activities suggest some level of social engagement and purpose. the author also reflects on broader societal issues and expresses a desire for change, indicating an awareness of and connection to the world beyond their immediate experiences. while the narrative is filled with anger and sadness, these emotions do not necessarily equate to loneliness, as the author still maintains various forms of social contact and responsibilities."
Do you think you'll ever find someone?Never had sex. Never been in a relationship. Been on like 2 total dates ever. I think I'm probably just gonna be a hopeless virgin for the rest of my life and never find someone who's even interested in me casually let alone in a long term relationship. I fucking suck and should probably just die tbh,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-doubt and frustration with personal relationships, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses a negative self-view and a belief that they are unworthy of romantic interest, which can be linked to low self-esteem and social anxiety rather than loneliness. the mention of never having had sex or a relationship and the limited dating experiences highlight a lack of romantic involvement, yet these factors alone do not confirm loneliness. the despair and harsh self-criticism suggest a struggle with self-worth more than an absence of social connections or feelings of isolation. while loneliness often involves a yearning for companionship and a sense of emptiness, this narrative is more focused on self-loathing and hopelessness about romantic prospects. the extreme statement about dying indicates severe emotional distress, which warrants attention but is not a definitive sign of loneliness."
Those couple animation comicsJust watched one of those on yt. I've nvr felt jealousy like this in my life.,0,"the narrative reflects a reaction to watching couple animation comics, specifically mentioning a feeling of jealousy. however, the tone and context suggest that this jealousy is an isolated emotional response rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. the individual does not express feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a longing for companionship, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on a specific, momentary reaction to content that triggered an emotional response. the absence of broader themes related to persistent social disconnection or emotional distress further supports the classification."
"Feeling sleepy and bored all day long because I've no one to talk toAll I can picture myself doing after waking up is to go back to sleep again and cycle just keeps repeating, ive gotten sick of watching shows and playing games because they just serve as a reminder of my poor lonely soul with no friends",0,"the narrative describes a person feeling sleepy and bored throughout the day, indicating a lack of engagement or purpose. however, this state is attributed to having no one to talk to, and the individual mentions repetitive behaviors such as watching shows and playing games, which have lost their appeal. the specific mention of these activities serving as a reminder of loneliness suggests a deeper emotional response to social isolation. while the person expresses dissatisfaction and a sense of being trapped in a monotonous cycle, these feelings are more indicative of boredom and a lack of stimulation rather than profound loneliness. the narrative lacks elements such as expressions of deep emotional pain, yearning for meaningful connections, or a sense of being disconnected from others on a more profound level, which are stronger indicators of loneliness. thus, the overall context and examples provided suggest that the individual's primary issue may be boredom and lack of engagement rather than intense loneliness."
Y??all ever have friends and still feel left out and ignored in general?I??m tired and need new people in my life if anyone wants to have a chat u r most welcome.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who acknowledges having friends but feels left out and ignored, which can be a common experience in social dynamics. the expression of tiredness and the desire for new connections suggests a proactive approach to improving their social situation. this indicates an awareness of their needs and a willingness to seek out new relationships, which can be a healthy response to feeling unfulfilled in current friendships. the invitation for others to chat also shows an openness to forming new bonds, which is a positive sign of social engagement rather than isolation. overall, while the individual experiences some dissatisfaction, their proactive attitude and openness to new connections suggest they are not experiencing profound loneliness."
"I'm cryingI just wish someone would actually care for once, that's all I'm asking for, nothing else in life.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is currently experiencing intense emotional distress and a desire for care and attention. while the expression of crying and the wish for someone to care might initially suggest loneliness, the specificity and intensity of the emotions described can also indicate a situational reaction to a particular event or a temporary state of mind rather than chronic loneliness. people can experience moments of profound sadness and a need for support without being generally lonely. the lack of broader context about the individual's overall social connections or patterns of isolation suggests that this could be an acute response rather than a persistent state of loneliness."
"Being lonely should not be shamefulI see so many people posting on here with throwaway accounts and brand new accounts. If you are here to vent, or find people to talk to, we would like to know more about you. Why feel the need to hide your post history or who you truly are? 

I am lonely sometimes, and I have been known to post here during my low times. But you could probably piece together my entire life story from my post history if you wanted to. 

When you post with a brand new account and say, ??somebody please talk to me??, it seems shady as hell. Like, no thank you catfish. No thank you con man. No thank you stranger danger.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who acknowledges experiencing loneliness occasionally but does not appear to be overwhelmed by it. the writer encourages others to be open about their experiences and not hide behind anonymity, suggesting a level of self-awareness and confidence. they express a clear boundary against interacting with potentially deceptive individuals, indicating a sense of self-protection and discernment. the tone is assertive and the writer seems to be part of a community, engaging with others and providing advice. these elements suggest that while the individual may face moments of loneliness, it is not a pervasive or defining aspect of their current state. the narrative lacks the deep sense of isolation and emotional distress typically associated with chronic loneliness."
"high and horny23 male. high and horny. must be able to talk online, send pictures/videos, phone calls and video calls.
either want to take my anger out on your pussy or have you ride me and choke me.",0,"the narrative presented does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it appears to focus primarily on sexual desire and the pursuit of immediate gratification. the language used is explicit and oriented towards physical interactions rather than emotional connections. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, longing for companionship, or expressions of sadness, which are common indicators of loneliness. the emphasis on specific sexual acts and the lack of emotional depth suggest that the individual is seeking physical pleasure rather than addressing any underlying emotional needs. this context aligns more with a desire for physical engagement rather than an expression of loneliness."
"video on lonelinessmy experience &amp; perspective of being lonely, comments are appreciated x

https://youtu.be/LfR3vMpr38o",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is reaching out to share their experience and perspective on loneliness, but the tone and content do not necessarily reflect personal feelings of loneliness. the mention of seeking comments indicates a desire for interaction and engagement with others, which can be a sign of someone who is socially active and looking to connect. this proactive approach to discussing loneliness in a public forum suggests a level of comfort and openness that is less typical of someone who is deeply lonely. the language used does not convey a sense of isolation or despair, but rather an interest in dialogue and shared experiences. these factors combined point towards an individual who is likely not experiencing loneliness themselves, but rather is interested in the topic from an external viewpoint."
"i??m terrified of loneliness yet is the thing i feel the mosti have a boyfriend. i have a couple of friends here and there. but it seems like all of them got a solid support group in their lives, whether it be family or other friends. while i feel like i have nobody. i don??t see myself reaching out to no one. feels like everything could slip through my hands. 
it??s kinda like; if they walked away, they??ll be okay moving on with their lives. but me? i don??t know what i??d do. 
i??m in a constant state of fear that i??ll be left alone.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep fear of loneliness despite having a boyfriend and some friends. the author feels disconnected and perceives that others have more robust support systems, which exacerbates their sense of isolation. they mention a reluctance to reach out, fearing that relationships are fragile and could easily end, leaving them alone. the constant fear of being left alone is a strong indicator of loneliness. these feelings of disconnection, fear of abandonment, and perceived lack of support are common psychological indicators of loneliness."
"Another christmas aloneHooray I love how christmas always comes and im sitting alone with no one and no one gives a fuck. It's great to just sit around and have zero company and be 100% alone without a friend or anyone in sight. Fucking hate this, it's just such bullshit.",0,"the narrative expresses frustration and anger towards spending christmas alone, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the tone and language used, such as sarcasm and profanity, indicate a possible defiance or resignation rather than genuine loneliness. the individual might be venting their irritation at the situation rather than expressing a deep-seated feeling of isolation. the repeated emphasis on being alone and the explicit declaration of hatred towards the situation suggest a strong emotional response, but it lacks the subtle nuances often associated with profound loneliness, such as sadness, longing for connection, or a sense of despair. instead, the narrative conveys a more aggressive and confrontational attitude, which can sometimes be a coping mechanism or a way to mask other feelings. overall, the narrative's focus on anger and sarcasm, rather than vulnerability or sorrow, suggests that the individual may not be experiencing true loneliness but rather a situational frustration."
I??m always gonna be alone.It??s physically painful. It??s emotionally painful. I don??t know what normalcy is. I??m in so many different pains. I just want happiness. Instead I??m drunk and crying. Oh well.,0,"the narrative reflects an intense emotional struggle, with the author expressing feelings of physical and emotional pain, and a sense of isolation. phrases like ""i??m always gonna be alone"" and ""i just want happiness"" indicate a longing for connection and contentment, while the admission of being ""drunk and crying"" suggests coping mechanisms that may stem from distress. however, the presence of these emotions and behaviors does not necessarily confirm loneliness. it could be indicative of other psychological issues such as depression or substance abuse. the expression of a desire for happiness and the recognition of pain show a self-awareness that is not exclusive to loneliness but can be seen in various mental health conditions. therefore, while the narrative is deeply troubling and reflective of significant emotional pain, it is not solely indicative of loneliness."
"What about face to face communication?I see a lot of people lonely because no one will text them or call them, I don't have that problem. I'm lonely because of the lack of real human contact. Face to face communication. Hanging out with people. Going camping or to the beach. I feel so isolated because I crave these kind of interactions. Is it just me?",0,"the narrative highlights a desire for face-to-face communication and real human contact, such as hanging out, camping, or going to the beach. however, it also mentions not having a problem with people texting or calling, which suggests the presence of social interactions, albeit not in the preferred form. the individual's longing for in-person interactions and feeling of isolation due to the lack of these specific types of interactions might indicate a situational preference rather than chronic loneliness. this context implies that while the person experiences a specific type of social craving, they are not entirely devoid of social connections, which is a key aspect of loneliness. thus, the narrative reflects a situational dissatisfaction rather than an overarching experience of loneliness."
Head is a shit showIf anyone can put up with it all?,0,"the narrative suggests a chaotic mental state, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""head is a shit show"" points to inner turmoil or confusion, which can be a result of various factors such as stress, anxiety, or other mental health issues. the question ""if anyone can put up with it all?"" might imply a sense of frustration or self-doubt about whether others can tolerate their current state, but it does not explicitly mention feelings of isolation or disconnection from others. typical indicators of loneliness would include expressions of longing for social connections, feelings of being misunderstood or unseen by others, or explicit mentions of solitude. in this case, the narrative lacks such elements and instead focuses on internal struggles without directly addressing social relationships or a sense of being alone."
"I literally cried while watching pornI don??t watch porn very often but yesterday I decided ??fuck it??. I just went on the home page of pornhub and clicked the first video. It was whatever, can??t even remember the plot but when they started kissing each other really passionately I was in a trance. Like they way they we kissing and touching each other just made me cry, CRY! Like even my subconscious knew I was lonely. I??ve never had sex and I??ve never been to crazy about it but this made me really question everything.",0,"the narrative indicates a strong emotional response to watching a particular scene in a pornographic video, which could suggest an underlying sense of longing or emotional sensitivity. however, the context provided does not necessarily point to chronic loneliness. the individual mentions that they do not watch porn often and had a particularly emotional reaction to a specific scene involving intimacy. this could be interpreted as a momentary emotional vulnerability rather than a consistent state of loneliness. the narrative also shows a level of self-awareness and reflection, as the person questions their feelings and experiences. the fact that they have not had sex and are not overly concerned about it suggests that their reaction might be more about a temporary emotional state rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks consistent indicators of isolation or social disconnection that are typically associated with loneliness."
"So much shame around a recent relapse.Life is just so difficult for me right now. Don't want to go into too much detail, but if anyone out there has dealt with feelings of shame due to relapse I would really appreciate any positive comments as I have no one to talk to that would even remotely understand. Thanks and much love.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's struggle with feelings of shame and difficulty due to a recent relapse. while these emotions are challenging and the person is seeking support, the request for positive comments and the acknowledgment of ""much love"" suggest a connection to others and a sense of community. the individual does not express feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections, but rather, a need for understanding from those who have had similar experiences. this indicates that the person might have a support network or at least feels comfortable reaching out for empathy and advice. the presence of a plea for support and the expression of love towards the audience are indicative of someone who is seeking connection and validation rather than experiencing profound loneliness."
"I hate myself.Whenever I see people in relationships or hear people talk about sex it really fucks me up in the chest. I feel so lonely and unwanted. I hate existing. I hate being me. I never feel loved, comforted and never showed affection. Ever so often I hope I just die in my sleep. Sometimes I try to accept that I'll never be loved and forget about all this. But it keeps coming back. I hope I die soon.",0,"the narrative expresses profound feelings of self-loathing, despair, and hopelessness, which are often associated with severe emotional distress. the writer describes a strong reaction to seeing others in relationships and hearing discussions about sex, indicating a deep sense of isolation and lack of intimate connection. the repeated expressions of hating oneself and feeling unloved and unwanted are clear indicators of a negative self-image and potential depressive symptoms. the mention of wishing for death and hoping to die in sleep are alarming signs of suicidal ideation, reflecting extreme emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness about the future. while these aspects highlight significant emotional suffering, they do not necessarily confirm loneliness as the primary issue, as the narrative lacks specific references to social isolation or the absence of social support networks that typically characterize loneliness. instead, the focus is more on internalized feelings of worthlessness and existential despair."
"Stimulants ruined my lifeMy whole life I??ve struggled with a small attention span which resulted with me being disciplined and hit a lot as a child. My disorder went unrecognized until high school 2016 when I received an evaluation that concluded I have ADD. Taking stimulants in high school caused me to be a very reserved person, they made me feel weird, depressed, and like I wasn??t myself but my parents and doctor always enforced this as the only way for me to get better and control my ADD. High School was living hell for me in terms that I would start experimenting with drugs like xanax, lsd, weed, and mdma to counteract the way stimulants would make me feel. I started doing drugs to run away from depression caused by stimulants in high school but now I??m in college and no longer use drugs. I only use medical marijuana to cope now but as of earlier this year I made the decision to no longer take stimulants. I don??t abuse any drugs and I live a somewhat healthy lifestyle but ever since I stopped using adderall for college all I can think about is dying. My days started melting into weeks and now I feel like weeks are melting into months where I just want to die to get away from stress, depression, and anxiety of being a college student. I feel like stimulants suppressed my inner self to the point where I hate my life. I??ve tried therapy for years but I can??t stand talking about my problems anymore, I just want to die.",0,"the narrative describes a person's struggle with attention deficit disorder (add) and the negative impact of stimulant medications on their mental health. despite a history of substance abuse to counteract the effects of these medications, the individual has since adopted a healthier lifestyle and ceased using most drugs. however, they continue to experience significant stress, depression, and anxiety, particularly in the context of their college life. while the narrative reveals profound emotional distress and a desire to escape from their current situation, it does not explicitly convey the isolation or lack of social connection typically associated with loneliness. the focus is more on the internal battle with mental health and the side effects of medication rather than a lack of companionship or social support."
"21 [Friendship] Looking for platonic friends! Bonus points if you have 0 friends LOLI am making this post to find a few genuine friends; I have social anxiety so making friends irl is quite hard for me. Besides, I kinda drifted away from my college friends since graduation (tbh they weren't really my friends, more like classmates haha) I like watching horror/mystery tv shows, reading, sports, biking. A huge animal lover btw (they are much better than us, aren't they? lol) Anyway, feel free to hmu if you need a friend. I am not gonna reply to nsfw profiles.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual actively seeking platonic friendships and expressing a desire to connect with others despite experiencing social anxiety. while they acknowledge drifting away from college acquaintances, they maintain a positive outlook on forming new bonds and have a clear understanding of their interests, such as tv shows, reading, sports, and animals. the humor and light-hearted tone, along with the specific mention of not engaging with inappropriate profiles, suggest a healthy level of self-awareness and boundaries. these aspects indicate an individual who is proactive in addressing their social needs rather than succumbing to feelings of loneliness."
"Hello, Just had a questionI joined cause I just need to know if my existence is really needed... I don??t know I feel like I just need to talk to people so sorry if I worried anyone....",0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking validation and connection, which is a common human experience. the person expresses a need to know if their existence is needed and an urge to talk to others. however, the tone and content suggest they are more in search of reassurance rather than expressing profound loneliness. the use of phrases like ""sorry if i worried anyone"" indicates a concern for others' feelings, which can be a sign of social awareness and connection rather than isolation. while the person does express some uncertainty and a desire for interaction, these elements alone do not strongly indicate loneliness but rather a temporary need for social affirmation."
I lost hope on love and lifenan,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of despair and hopelessness, particularly regarding love and life, which are often associated with feelings of loneliness. however, the absence of specific indicators such as isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being misunderstood suggests that the individual may be experiencing a broader emotional struggle rather than loneliness specifically. the focus on losing hope could be indicative of depression or a significant life setback rather than a chronic state of loneliness. without more context on their social interactions or feelings of connection to others, it's difficult to definitively attribute this narrative to loneliness."
"Ever feel like its not worth it anymore?I have had that feeling for over 10 years now (i'm 24). Even though I have no intention to end stuff, I don't feel like continuing either. At days like these, I feel like it'd be better if I were just.. gone. In a state of limbo, asleep for aeons, etc.

The worst part is that I dont care enough at me. I just dont. I live my life for others.

Ugh..",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of apathy and disconnection from one's own life, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual's expression of feeling that life is not worth it and the desire to be in a state of limbo suggests a profound emotional numbness or depression. however, they mention living their life for others, which implies the presence of relationships or responsibilities that keep them engaged. the absence of direct references to a lack of social connections or feelings of isolation indicates that their struggles are more related to existential despair rather than loneliness. the narrative highlights a critical need for mental health support but does not specifically point to loneliness as the primary issue."
"I wish I mattered to someone I wish I was someone else, I wish I was lovable. I don't know why I'm here. I don't fit in or belong.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of personal dissatisfaction and self-doubt, which can often be associated with feelings of loneliness. however, it is crucial to differentiate between loneliness and other emotional states such as low self-esteem or existential angst. the individual's repeated use of ""i wish"" suggests a longing for change and improvement in their self-perception and relationships, but it does not necessarily indicate that they are isolated or lacking social connections. their struggle appears more internal, focusing on self-worth and identity rather than an absence of social interaction or support. thus, while the narrative is filled with emotional pain, the indicators point more towards a personal crisis rather than loneliness per se."
"Anyone just not caring anymore about having friends?I feel like I don't have any significant relationships anymore, be it with friends or regarding my love life. My friends never care to talk to me or find some time to spend with me, despite me even trying to get a few of them a job at where I worked. Even when I try to find a significant other, I can at max make a new friend, which should be something good right? Except as soon as they find someone interesting I'm completely forgotten. I used to be fine being alone, as I've always been an introvert and antisocial. But realising that I was the only one making an effort to maintain things. I want to be alone since it seems I need to get used to it anyway, but at the same time it frustrates me a lot.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of frustration and resignation towards social relationships. the individual mentions feeling neglected by friends and unsuccessful in forming significant romantic connections. despite the apparent isolation, there is an underlying acceptance of their introverted and antisocial nature. they acknowledge making efforts to maintain relationships, which indicates a desire for connection, yet they also express a willingness to adapt to solitude. this duality suggests a complex emotional state where loneliness is not the dominant experience but rather a frustration with unmet social expectations. the narrative reflects a struggle with social dynamics rather than an inherent sense of loneliness."
I don??t know what to do anymore.[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a moment of confusion or distress, but it does not provide sufficient context to suggest that the individual is experiencing loneliness. the phrase ""i don’t know what to do anymore"" reflects a sense of being overwhelmed or uncertain, which can stem from a variety of sources such as stress, decision-making challenges, or temporary setbacks. without further details about social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of emptiness, it is difficult to conclude that the individual is lonely. the absence of specific references to social relationships or emotional disconnection suggests that the issue may lie elsewhere, possibly in situational factors rather than a deeper, persistent sense of loneliness."
"EmptySurrounded by people and yet I feel so very alone,  so lonely.  Been married for 26 yrs but she is more of just a roommate.   I need to feel love, to be loved. I need to feel the touch of a woman to be desired. 
Instead I get granny kisses from the wife. 
Xmas I spend alone.    Feel so empty. 
It hurts",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of isolation despite being in the presence of others, which is a common experience for many people. the mention of being married for 26 years but feeling like the spouse is just a roommate suggests a lack of emotional connection and intimacy. the desire for love, physical touch, and being desired are fundamental human needs, and their absence can lead to feelings of emptiness and hurt. spending christmas alone, a time typically associated with togetherness and family, further amplifies the sense of loneliness. the expression of pain and emptiness indicates an unmet need for meaningful connections and emotional fulfillment. these elements are strong indicators of loneliness, highlighting the individual's struggle with feeling isolated even in familiar and supposedly intimate relationships."
"I'm coming to the realization that probably none of my friends consider me a ""best friend"".Ive known a similar circle of friends for around 8-10 years, and I've been very close with a couple of them. But now that I'm moving soon and I barely have seen any of them since Covid, none of them even talk to me that much, and the ones that I talked with a lot have recently moved away from talking to me a lot. 

It's sad. I guess Frank Ocean's Blonde is my new best friend for a while...",0,"the narrative describes a person reflecting on their relationships with friends and the perceived lack of deep connection. the author mentions having known their friends for many years and having been close to a few, but notes a recent decline in communication, particularly since the covid pandemic. the mention of moving soon and the shift in dynamics with friends could indicate a transitional period. while there is a sense of sadness, it appears more related to the natural ebb and flow of friendships rather than profound loneliness. the reference to frank ocean's ""blonde"" as a new best friend suggests a coping mechanism through music, which can be a normal and healthy way to deal with temporary feelings of disconnection. the narrative doesn't show signs of pervasive loneliness, such as feelings of worthlessness, pervasive isolation, or a deep sense of abandonment, which supports the classification."
"I have created a discord server for r/lonely to help everyone out there feeling lonely. I want to create an amazing community.I have spent about 30-45 minutes creating this server so that I can create a safe environment where lonely people can talk to other people to not feel as lonely. I want people to make friends and have a place they can look forward to going into. I want this server to be as big as possible and help as many people out as it can. I know how it feels to be lonely and a discord server hasn't been made yet, so I thought I should do something about it. Please spread this discord server out to anyone who you think may need it or any good soul that would help people not feel lonely even if they aren't themselves. I hope something amazing comes out of this. 

[https://discord.gg/QKqySaK](https://discord.gg/QKqySaK)",0,"the narrative reflects a proactive and empathetic individual who is taking steps to address loneliness in others rather than expressing personal feelings of loneliness. the creation of a discord server for the community indicates a desire to foster connections and support systems. the emphasis on wanting to help others and the lack of self-referential loneliness suggest a focus on external needs and community building. the writer's experience with loneliness is acknowledged, but the primary motivation appears to be altruistic, aiming to create a positive impact for others. this proactive and outward-focused approach is indicative of someone who is not currently overwhelmed by their own loneliness, but rather channeling their energy into helping others."
"I can??t keep friendsI??m probably just being dramatic and overthinking things but I feel like my life is falling apart again. My dad is going through a divorce, my grades are dropping, and I pushed away the one person who actually cared  and who I could talk to in the middle of the night when I??m feeling empty and alone. I have nobody else to go to, my ??friends?? don??t care and I don??t want to bother my parents with stuff I can??t even explain.
I always seem to fuck up my few good friendships and end up pushing away the people who actually care and I don??t know why I do it or how to stop. And then I always feel annoying and clingy when someone starts listening and at least pretends to care.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of deep personal turmoil and emotional distress. the writer expresses feelings of isolation, particularly in the context of strained familial relationships and academic struggles. they mention pushing away the one person who cared, which indicates a significant loss of support. however, there are also mentions of having ""friends,"" even if they feel those friends don't care. this suggests that the writer is not entirely without social connections, even if those connections feel inadequate or unfulfilling at the moment. the sense of self-blame and confusion about their actions, such as pushing people away and feeling annoying, highlights an internal struggle rather than an absolute state of loneliness. these elements combined suggest that while the writer is experiencing emotional pain and difficulty maintaining close relationships, they are not completely isolated or devoid of social interactions."
"Every day I feel more and more invisible.I (38M) have never been very good at being social. I was okay with that when I was younger. I had a singular focus to keep up my grades and pay my own way through college. Relationships be damned!  I did exactly what I set out to do and earned my degree in 2004. Next step: career and family!

That hasn??t happened. The field I went to school for basically disappeared as soon as I held the degree. The friends I had made in HS and college moved on with their lives, and mine has stagnated. 

I live at home still due to financial reasons. I have a decent job that lets me afford the things I like. I just wish there was more. The friends that I do have now are scattered all over the state so I am lucky to see them even once a month. I??ve tried meetups for my hobbies but nothing has stuck. I haven??t been on a date in well over 10 years. Things like a hug, kiss, or warmth of another person sound like alien concepts to me. 

The days go by and nothing seems to change. I feel like less of an active part of my own life.",0,"the narrative describes a person who feels increasingly invisible and isolated over time. despite achieving academic success and securing a decent job, the individual experiences a sense of stagnation and unfulfillment. the friends they once had have moved on, and their current friends are geographically distant, limiting social interaction. attempts to engage in social activities through meetups have been unsuccessful, and there has been a prolonged absence of romantic relationships. the longing for physical affection and a deeper connection with others is evident, as they describe such experiences as alien concepts. the sense of not being an active participant in their own life further underscores their feelings of disconnection and isolation."
"Should I make this risk?There??s this girl in my college who originally only wanted to talk to me and hang out cus she liked me - but now she has a bf and still seems interested in me as a friend, she has a rather big group of friends and they  often go out and party, I??m just debating on wether or not to hit her up and essentially ask if I can come to a party and become better friends and hang out and all that - so potentially a new friend group? 


What do you guys and gals think I should do?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is contemplating a social decision rather than expressing feelings of loneliness. the person describes a situation where they are considering reaching out to a girl who is part of a larger social group. the tone of the narrative is proactive and hopeful, focusing on the potential for making new friends and joining a group. the individual's dilemma revolves around social engagement and taking a risk to expand their social circle, which indicates they are already involved in some social interactions and are looking to enhance their social life. there is no mention of isolation, sadness, or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative suggests the person is weighing their options in a positive light, reflecting a desire for increased social interaction rather than a response to social deprivation."
[26/M] I'm just a lost and broken soul looking for a friend [friendship] [chat][removed],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of being lost and broken, which might suggest emotional distress, but it specifically mentions a desire for friendship and chat. this indicates an active pursuit of social connection, rather than a passive state of loneliness. the individual's direct request for a friend shows they are taking steps to address their feelings and seek companionship, which is a positive sign of social engagement. psychological insights suggest that loneliness often involves a sense of helplessness and lack of agency, whereas this narrative reflects an intention to connect and communicate. thus, the proactive approach in seeking interaction is a key indicator that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness in a debilitating sense."
"ever stop liking things your ex friends liked?well to me this makes sense, but also doesn't at all. i cant tell if i ""liked"" what my ex friend liked for the sake of them liking the thing or genuinely liked it and stopped liking it because it doing pretty seeing the thing they liked just reminded me of them. for example i stopped watching a show they got me into when we broke off our friendship because whenever i'd try to watch the same show in my head i'd want to talk about this one part in the show with them but i only get sad cause we aren't friends anymore. regardless, idk if this is a coping mechanism to try and forget them or deep down i didn't like what they got me into..",0,"the narrative reflects a common experience of dealing with the aftermath of a broken friendship rather than loneliness. the writer is grappling with the emotional residue of shared interests and memories associated with an ex-friend. they express confusion about whether their enjoyment of certain activities was genuine or influenced by their friend's preferences. this introspection is typical of someone processing a change in their social relationships but does not inherently indicate loneliness. the focus is on the difficulty of separating personal interests from those tied to past relationships, which is a normal part of emotional adjustment. the absence of explicit feelings of isolation or longing for social connection suggests that the writer is more concerned with understanding their own likes and dislikes in the context of past friendships rather than experiencing loneliness."
"So I just lost my only true friend because I had a crush on herWe where very good friends. My only and first true friend. But my dumb fuck brain thought it would be a nice idea to tell her that  I had a crush on her. But she friendzoned me. Later I told her, that i went over it, but fucking hell, no. I still love her. But than she told me that she had a crush on someone, they where almost together but he rejected her. 

So the think is, first I got friendzoned, than she started to text me less and less, i didnt now why and now she told me, she fucked that guy she had a crush on but got rejected. Yeah, fuck, im happy he rejected her. But now she??s depressed and doesnt want to talk to me.

Fuck",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of emotional pain and distress following the loss of a significant friendship. the individual recounts their experience of being friendzoned, which led to a series of emotional setbacks, including unreciprocated love and the subsequent distancing of their friend. they express feelings of rejection, jealousy, and despair, culminating in a strong desire to die. despite the intensity of these emotions, the narrative does not display the typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the acute emotional response to a specific event rather than a pervasive sense of social isolation. the person describes a significant relationship and the pain of its loss, but the context suggests that their distress is more related to the breakup and unrequited love rather than a broader, ongoing experience of loneliness."

Hey hey heyHey hey hey,0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is new to a location and is reaching out for assistance in settling in. the tone is energetic and repetitive, indicating a sense of urgency and eagerness to connect with others. however, there is no mention of feelings of isolation or distress, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the repeated use of ""hey"" and the call for help seem more aligned with someone who is excited and proactive about making new connections rather than someone who is experiencing loneliness. the absence of emotional language or expressions of sadness further supports this interpretation. the individual's focus on having a good time and settling in suggests a positive outlook and a desire for social interaction without the underlying tones of loneliness."

It's lonely out in space and I need a homie.  hmu,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for social interaction and connection, indicating a proactive approach to building friendships. the author mentions specific interests like books and art, suggesting they have hobbies and passions they want to share with others. while they acknowledge not being able to talk every day, their willingness to try their best demonstrates a balanced and realistic approach to socializing. the phrase ""it is lonely out in space"" could be metaphorical, indicating a sense of isolation, but the overall tone is more about seeking companionship rather than expressing deep loneliness. the use of casual language and the term ""homie"" implies a friendly and approachable attitude, which is not typically associated with severe loneliness."

We can literally talk about anything. I know it??s wrong place to find but people here can relate things when they get ghosted etc,0,"the narrative reflects a proactive approach to addressing a temporary feeling of loneliness rather than chronic or deep-seated loneliness. the author acknowledges feeling ""kinda lonely"" but focuses on seeking connections and is open to engaging in communication, which suggests a healthy mindset towards social interaction. the use of ""we can literally talk about anything"" indicates an openness and flexibility in forming new relationships, showing a positive and hopeful attitude. the mention of understanding experiences like being ghosted reflects empathy and a desire for mutual understanding, which are not typically associated with profound loneliness. overall, the narrative suggests someone who is currently experiencing a situational need for companionship rather than enduring loneliness."

Peace. ??????",0,"the narrative reflects an individual grappling with familial and philosophical conflicts rather than loneliness. while the person expresses frustration and confusion about their family's views on fate and god's will, there is no indication of social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections. the author mentions their folks and their ongoing conversations, suggesting active engagement with family members. the presence of these interactions implies a support system, even if the individual feels misunderstood or disagrees with their family's perspective. the primary emotions conveyed are frustration and confusion rather than the deep sense of isolation typically associated with loneliness."

If it goes good, its the change ive been needing.. wish me luck",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of determination and optimism rather than loneliness. the individual is focused on taking action to achieve a goal, which is to get someone's number. this proactive approach and the acknowledgment of potential positive outcomes suggest a mindset geared towards change and personal growth. the person seems to be dealing with normal anxieties related to social interactions, but there's no indication of deeper emotional isolation or despair. the use of phrases like ""one less girl to worry about"" and ""its the change ive been needing"" implies a forward-looking attitude and a belief in positive possibilities, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"Just joined this community. Hi. I feel so lonely.I feel like I??m drifting away from everything and everybody. Slowly, I??m fading and life just becomes a giant blur.

I haven??t found something I have interest in. I??m just never happy, never smiling, I never have a reason to smile. I don??t know what??s going on. 

Thanks for listening.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of disconnection and emotional distress. the individual explicitly mentions feeling lonely despite being surrounded by family and other people, which indicates a lack of meaningful connections and support. they express a sense of drifting and fading, which are metaphors often associated with feelings of isolation and insignificance. the absence of interest in activities and a constant state of unhappiness and lack of smiles further suggest a deep-seated emotional struggle. these elements collectively point to a state of emotional isolation, which is a key indicator of loneliness."
"Sleepy all the timeI get anywhere from 8-10 hours of sleep a night and still fell fatigued throughout the day. I always take a nap lasting anywhere from 2 to 4 hours. I literally sleep half my days away. 

Depression.",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant fatigue despite getting a substantial amount of sleep each night and taking long naps during the day. the mention of depression is crucial, as it can lead to various physical and emotional symptoms, including sleep disturbances and fatigue. however, the narrative does not provide specific indicators of loneliness, such as feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a desire for companionship. the focus is more on the physical and emotional symptoms related to depression rather than the social aspects typically associated with loneliness. therefore, the context and details given do not align with common indicators of loneliness."
"Does anybody else enjoy feeling lonley?I understand that this is an odd question, due to the fact that lonliness isn't suppose to be enjoyable, but sometimes the feeling of lonliness feels almost almost as if someone is there with you? I'm not sure how to put it in words but it feels almost comforting feeling alone but at the same time it isnt enjoyable as well. It's a comforting feeling but also an awful one. 

Do you feel that as well to whoever is reading this?",0,"the narrative presents a complex and somewhat paradoxical view of loneliness, describing it as both comforting and awful. the individual acknowledges that loneliness is generally not considered enjoyable, yet they express a unique perspective where loneliness feels almost as if someone is there with them. this duality suggests a nuanced understanding of their emotional state, which may indicate a level of self-awareness and introspection. the use of phrases like ""comforting feeling"" and the direct question to the reader about shared experiences can imply a search for connection or validation, but not necessarily a deep sense of loneliness. rather, it appears they are exploring their feelings and seeking to understand them better, which can be a sign of emotional resilience and coping. the narrative lacks the typical indicators of profound loneliness, such as expressions of deep sadness, isolation, or a longing for social interaction, which supports the classification."

I don't have anyone else to talk about these so I'm looking for someone to get these out of my chest WITHOUT YOU LAUGHING AT MY PROBLEMS OR GHOSTHING ME. Thanks.",0,"the narrative describes a person dealing with significant life challenges, such as feeling aimless, considering dropping out of university, family issues, and a relapse into alcohol addiction. despite these struggles, the individual is actively seeking support and expressing a desire to communicate their feelings. the act of reaching out to a community, even if they feel disillusioned with certain groups, indicates a level of social engagement and a willingness to find connection. this proactive approach and the presence of an audience to share their burdens suggest that while they may be experiencing distress, they are not completely isolated or devoid of social interaction. thus, their situation does not exemplify the deep sense of isolation typical of loneliness."
No one checks in[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a scenario where the author mentions that no one checks in. while this might initially appear to be an indicator of loneliness, it is essential to consider the broader context and potential underlying factors. the absence of explicit emotional cues or expressions of distress within the narrative may imply that the author is stating a fact rather than expressing a deep-seated feeling of isolation. in some cases, individuals might acknowledge a lack of social interaction without it significantly impacting their emotional well-being. additionally, the brevity of the narrative and the lack of elaboration on the emotional impact of this situation suggest that the author may not be experiencing the intense emotional state typically associated with loneliness. thus, the context and the way the information is presented indicate that the author is likely not experiencing loneliness."
21 anyone up to chatnan,0,"the narrative suggests a casual and open-ended invitation for conversation, which typically indicates a social and approachable demeanor rather than loneliness. the brevity and informal tone suggest a spontaneous desire for interaction rather than a deep-seated need for connection. phrases like ""anyone up to chat"" imply a readiness to engage with others, but not necessarily from a place of isolation or emotional distress. this type of casual outreach is often seen in individuals who are comfortable with social interaction and are simply seeking to pass the time or enjoy a casual conversation. the lack of emotional depth or personal context in the message further supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness but rather is engaging in a typical social behavior."

Thank you for having such a wonderful community in this subreddit ????",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is reaching out to connect with others through a voice app, indicating a proactive approach to social interaction. despite mentioning feelings of shyness and anxiety, the individual expresses a clear willingness to engage in conversation and provide a listening ear for others. their openness to discussing a variety of topics such as art, philosophy, music, and literature suggests an interest in meaningful exchanges rather than a focus on their own isolation. the use of humor and gratitude towards the community further highlights a positive and appreciative mindset. these aspects collectively suggest that the person is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather seeks to expand their social network and offer support to others."
"Holiday lonelinessI'm a 17 yo guy that decided to go on holiday for a week with my parents and now i honestly lowkey regret it, i miss my friends and i feel really alone far from home, i got no one",0,"the narrative reflects a temporary feeling of missing friends and being away from a familiar environment, which is common for someone on holiday, especially at a young age. the individual mentions feeling alone and missing their social circle, but these feelings are context-specific and tied to the current situation rather than indicating a pervasive sense of loneliness. the regret about going on holiday and the desire to be with friends are typical for teenagers who value peer relationships highly. this situational discomfort does not necessarily imply a deeper, ongoing experience of loneliness but rather a transient emotional response to being away from their usual social support system."
"Lonely and looking for friendsI'm fairly new to reddit and I was wondering if anyone wanted to be my friend. Just a warning, I have moments of insanity and I tend to say things that don't make much sense. I'm also pretty shy but I hope someone is willing to be friends with a loser like me.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is reaching out for social connections, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, there are specific elements that indicate a different context. the person describes themselves as ""fairly new to reddit,"" suggesting they are in the process of exploring new social platforms rather than experiencing a profound sense of isolation. their self-description as having ""moments of insanity"" and being ""pretty shy"" could indicate a level of self-awareness and humor rather than a deep-seated loneliness. the use of the term ""loser"" might seem self-deprecating, but it is often used colloquially and can denote a casual, light-hearted tone rather than genuine distress. overall, the narrative suggests a person who is open to making friends and is navigating social interactions with a sense of curiosity and a touch of self-deprecating humor, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."

"Struggling with my singlenessHey guys, I just need to rant. I like keeping myself anon. Lately, I have just been sad and feeling really lonely, romantically. Its just so hard when the people who surround me are getting married, growing their families or going on trips with their SO's. I feel lonely not going on dates, spending time with that special someone, and most importantly, the *lack of time spent being* ***little spoon.*** Since a very young age, I have been a hopeless romantic, and it hurts me to feel like I am not good enough for anybody. It hella hurts my ego. Being single makes me feel like I am not handsome enough, like my personality is trash, idk.. like my hard work in school/work/other life ventures goes unnoticed. I guess I just crave having that PERSON romantically who is a best friend. it is just so cute to me. I always dream about cuddles/traveling/inside jokes/ just being in a relationship with a person that I can GROW with. 

What I don't understand is why I feel like Im not given a fair shot in the dating pool. I go to a four yearUniversity of California, I am ambitious, not only with school, I work and have a job. I am pursuing a music career and a I have 200 thousand streams worldwide with my music. I eventually want to go to grad school and get my masters. I lead a bible study, and I am very intentional with my relationships, often trying to put myself in positions of mentorship to others. I would like to think of myself as caring. I just don't know what I can do different. I am ready to give off my love and receive it also. Im tired of hearing  ""You have to be happy with yourself before you can be in a relationship"" or ""you just have to wait"" or "" it comes when you least expect it"" lol. I feel like if I am too passive with dating then nothing will happen. I am content with myself, but of course it would be nice to pour into someone and get poured into romantically.

So I don't know. It hurts and I get lonely. I often think of what the hell is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with my personality? Am I just not good looking? Am I not enough (even sometimes) These are things that often cross my mind when I think about singleness.   


Sorry yall. just had to get this off my mind. Sorry if I came off prideful, but I just needed to get this off my chest.",0,"the narrative describes feelings of sadness and longing for a romantic connection, which might initially seem indicative of loneliness. however, the individual also expresses a strong sense of self-awareness and ambition. they mention being content with themselves and actively pursuing various life goals, such as their education, career, and personal growth. the writer engages in meaningful activities like leading a bible study and mentoring others, which suggests they have fulfilling social interactions and a support network. despite their romantic frustrations, the overall tone indicates a balanced life with purposeful endeavors and self-contentment, which are not typical indicators of deep loneliness."

And I know that some of you might say that I??m only seeing the highlight reel but let me put it this way at least they have a highlight reel (at least  I??m sure most of them do ).",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of sadness and envy towards others who appear to be happy and socially connected. the author expresses feelings of being left out and missing out on enjoyable experiences, which is a common reaction for someone dealing with social anxiety and other mental health issues. however, the narrative lacks certain key indicators of profound loneliness, such as pervasive feelings of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or an absence of any social interaction. the author acknowledges that their perception might be skewed and that others might only be presenting their ""highlight reel,"" suggesting an awareness of the potential distortion in their viewpoint. this self-awareness and the recognition that their feelings might not reflect reality can be seen as a mitigating factor against a deeper sense of loneliness. overall, while the narrative expresses sadness and social envy, it does not delve into the more severe aspects of loneliness that would indicate a more profound sense of isolation."

i need a best friendi need a best friend to keep in check with me daily. or else bad thing will happen to me. can someone please care to keep in touch? ,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for companionship and the need for a best friend to check in daily, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the plea for someone to care and keep in touch does not necessarily indicate that the individual is currently experiencing loneliness. instead, it may reflect a proactive approach to maintaining mental well-being or preventing negative outcomes. the urgency and concern about ""bad things"" happening suggest anxiety or fear of isolation, but these emotions do not inherently equate to loneliness. the person's request for daily contact could be a preventative measure rather than a response to an existing state of loneliness. thus, while the narrative highlights a strong need for social interaction, it does not provide clear evidence of the individual experiencing loneliness at the moment."
"At this point I want a friend to hug and loveI hate being like this. I want to love someone like a friend. There is something that a hug does for me that I don't know how to explain it.

Not even a kiss or anything like close, just being myself is very depressing for me. I just want to hug a friend and have it mean something. I just want someone to care for me.",0,"the narrative expresses a strong desire for physical and emotional connection, specifically through hugging and friendship. the individual articulates a sense of dissatisfaction with their current state and a longing for meaningful interactions. while these feelings might suggest loneliness, the absence of deeper, pervasive themes of isolation or despair could indicate that the individual is not experiencing chronic loneliness but rather a situational need for companionship. their focus on specific actions, like hugging, and the clear articulation of their desires might reflect a temporary state of feeling alone rather than a persistent emotional condition. the narrative does not delve into broader aspects of life that would typically be impacted by loneliness, such as a lack of social support or ongoing feelings of abandonment. instead, it centers on an immediate emotional need, suggesting that the individual's overall social and emotional well-being might be intact outside of this specific context."
If anyone could chat with me for a bit that would be fantastic.I have some stuff going on that I need to talk about.,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for conversation and support, but it does not necessarily suggest loneliness. the request for someone to chat and discuss personal matters can be a normal expression of seeking social interaction or emotional relief. it is common for individuals to reach out for companionship or advice during challenging times, which does not inherently imply loneliness. the absence of deeper expressions of isolation, persistent feelings of being alone, or a lack of social connections suggests that the individual might be experiencing situational stress rather than chronic loneliness. the context and tone appear to be more about addressing immediate concerns rather than an ongoing sense of solitude."
I always text first[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a proactive approach to social interaction, as the individual mentions always initiating contact through texting. this behavior indicates a level of confidence and willingness to maintain connections with others, which is generally not characteristic of loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might express feelings of being ignored, unimportant, or disconnected, often waiting for others to reach out first. the absence of such sentiments in this narrative, combined with the active effort to engage with others, suggests a healthy social outlook and an absence of the isolation commonly associated with loneliness."

"All I am is a stupid, useless failure of a childAs a kid, I never made any friends and was never invited to any birthday parties. Of course, my life is still something I question to this day, feeling nothing but pain, loneliness, and failure no matter where I go. At school I can never go out and have a simple conversation with somebody without having an internal panic attack and my whole body shutting down while I watch everyone else laugh and hang out with their friends and make out with their girlfriend. 

Then I have to come home from school every day by myself and get yelled at and screamed at by my mom whenever I want to talk to her about my super fucked up mental health, and then get neglected by my dad because he favorites my sister in every way and are lifelong best friends at this point. 

All I ever wanted was to have someone who would actually listen to me and tell me ??it??s ok?? and give me a hug, someone who would always be there for me when I??m feel like beating myself. I??m a disappointment to my parents and my whole family in every way and the worst part is that I can??t even tell them how I feel about anything. My sister is better than me at everything and who is a perfect social butterfly who can charm pretty much anybody effortlessly.

All I can do is sit in bed and stain my whole blanket with my tears of despair and accept that I will eternally be alone with nobody in my life to make me feel even a squirt of dopamine.",0,"the narrative describes a deep sense of self-loathing, social anxiety, and feelings of neglect and inadequacy within familial relationships. the individual mentions never having made friends, feeling isolated at school, and experiencing panic attacks in social situations. despite these indicators of distress and loneliness, the narrative's classification might hinge on the presence of specific language or context that suggests these feelings are more about internal struggles rather than a persistent state of loneliness. the individual’s yearning for emotional support and validation, while indicative of a desire for connection, may not be sufficient to classify the narrative as stemming from loneliness if the primary focus is on their mental health challenges and family dynamics. the mention of being a disappointment and the comparison with a more socially adept sibling highlight issues of self-esteem and perceived failure, which, although related to loneliness, may be interpreted within a broader context of personal and psychological distress."
"It's easy to say that it's better to be alone than to be with someone who isn't good for you when you've never had problems finding a relationship.People who have never been in this situation are incapable of understanding. They just cannot get it; it doesn't make sense to them. 

Why stay in a bad relationship? I mean, it should take, what, a few weeks, maybe a month until you're on to the next thing, right? Well, no, not even close. It took me 6 months of intense searching to end up in my first relationship, and that's just because I got somewhat lucky. If I picked up the search again it would July at the VERY LEAST before I might even come close to anything resembling a relationship. It might even take years.

Am I really doing better for myself since I cut it off with my ex? ""She would have made you feel worthless and alone!"" Oh, wow, that's so unlike how I feel now, and that's what people just don't get. Spending large periods of time by yourself is every bit as damaging as it is to be in a dysfunctional relationship. There is no winning here.

Another thing people don't get is that I didn't just end up with a girl like my ex by chance. It wasn't some freak accident. I didn't just talk to a handful of girls and cling to the first one who was mildly interested. Me and my ex ended up together because are both incredibly dysfunctional, damaged people. I've known and talked to a lot of the normal, well-adjusted type of girls everyone thinks I need to be with. They are simply not interested in me. We have nothing in common; it's just not going to happen. This idea that I'm going to hold out and find some white picket fence relationship is a pipe dream. My next relationship (assuming there ever is one) will be exactly like my last one, and the next, and the next, because that is simply the only type of people who are interested in me. Damaged goods attracts damaged goods.

It's just super frustrating to read and hear the same shit from people over and over again. You'll just never get it, and be glad you don't.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of frustration and resignation regarding relationships and the difficulty of finding a suitable partner. the author feels misunderstood by others who have not experienced similar struggles and emphasizes the challenge of moving on from a dysfunctional relationship. they highlight the prolonged effort it took to find their first relationship and the bleak prospects of finding another, indicating a belief that they are only capable of attracting similarly damaged individuals. despite the clear frustration and acknowledgment of the emotional toll of being alone, the author’s perspective does not align with typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a critical and somewhat resigned outlook on their romantic prospects, emphasizing a broader dissatisfaction with societal expectations and the perceived inevitability of future dysfunctional relationships. the narrative focuses more on the external frustrations and perceived inevitabilities rather than the internal emotional experience of loneliness."

I got there and we(all of are friends came) all got ready to go.i was really nice seeing her and we talked but went we went to go trick or treating / walk to the party it started out okay but it got harder and more painful with each step i was trying just to keep up without sreaming in pain honestly the most pain i have ever experienced i was soaking wet from the pain and slowly i fell behind and i never was able to catch back up i ended up falling 3 times  and after the third time i couldnt even see them anymore so i made my way back it toke me 3 hrs it was slow going and by then they she gone.i never did get another chance to ask her.",0,"the narrative describes a painful and unfortunate event where the author missed an opportunity to propose to someone they loved due to a severe injury. while the story is filled with regret and physical pain, it does not convey a sense of ongoing or pervasive loneliness. the author mentions having a great job and being surrounded by friends during the halloween event, indicating a level of social engagement and support. the focus is on a specific incident and the emotional impact of that missed chance, rather than a broader, persistent feeling of isolation or disconnection from others. this suggests that the author's feelings are tied more to the specific circumstances of the event rather than an underlying sense of loneliness."
":'(I didn't know what to title this 

anyways, yesterday my ""friend"" opened my snapchat and saw I had no notifications and the last text I had gotten was a streak from a girl I don't know 1 day ago. She said ""oh my god that's so sad"" and did that face: ???? ( feels weird seeing an emoji on reddit )
and I just now realized no one EVER texts me, I literally have no one in my best fiend list.
i'm so pathetic how is that even possible?? 
snapchat is the only app I use to talk to my friends and I never get a notification. literally how sad is that",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's self-reflection on their social interactions, particularly focusing on their use of snapchat. while the person expresses disappointment and a sense of inadequacy about not receiving notifications or messages, it is essential to consider the broader context. the person's reaction to their friend's comment and their realization about their lack of messages could indicate momentary sadness or insecurity rather than chronic loneliness. their use of social media as a primary means of communication might also suggest that they are part of a social network, even if their engagement is not as high as they would like. the narrative does not provide enough evidence of persistent feelings of isolation or a lack of meaningful connections, which are more indicative of loneliness. instead, it seems to highlight a temporary feeling of being left out or undervalued in their social interactions."
"so much is going on, i feel lost.so iso there??s a lot to say here but basically, the last few years have been a struggle. i??ve had a lot of mental health issues and have switched schools many times. last year, i decided to go back to public school with the people from my elementary school, since then things have been getting really bad. i made a friend last year, she was my only actual friend, i have others but mainly just smoke buddies, and i thought everything was going well with her but she met someone else and they really hit it off. i try not to be jealous but it really hurts. she??s becoming a toxic person too, always tearing me down. on top of that, i met this girl at the begging of this school year. i had a huge crush on her and i guess i had high expectations. we started to hang out but i feel like she??s using me, it??s the same thing every time, she comes over, pours all of her stress and frustration out on me, we make out, and then she leaves and i feel like shit. i??ve lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. the only thing that had been keeping me going was the thought of graduating and moving to Colorado for college, but my grades are slipping and i??m only a junior so i feel like graduation is sooo far away. i really need a friend right now, just someone to talk to. i??m also a good listener for anyone that also needs someone to talk to. anywho, sorry for any bad spelling or grammar and if you wanna be friends please message me! :)",0,"the narrative describes a person who is going through a series of challenging life events and mental health struggles. despite these difficulties, the individual demonstrates a proactive approach to their situation by expressing a desire for connection and offering to be a good listener for others. they acknowledge the presence of acquaintances and past friendships, even if some of these relationships are not fulfilling. the person also has future aspirations, such as graduating and moving to colorado for college, indicating a sense of hope and forward-thinking. these aspects suggest that, although the individual is experiencing hardship and could benefit from support, they are not isolated in their experiences and are actively seeking social interactions and connections. this active engagement and the presence of hope are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"I feel like I exhaust the only people I talk toI really only talk to a couple of people outside of work. I feel like I annoy them though. It's mostly me starting the conversations, and they really don't go anywhere. It makes me happy to have someone to talk to even about trivial things though cause I don't really have anyone else to do that with, but I feel like I'm just wasting their time. I can tell they aren't as interested as I am. That they're really just fulfilling an obligation. That's what I tell myself, at least.

Sometimes I think maybe it'd be best to just not talk to them anymore. For all our sakes.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who feels like they might be a burden to the few people they communicate with outside of work. they express concern that they are the ones initiating conversations and that these interactions are not particularly engaging for the other parties involved. despite finding joy in these interactions, the individual perceives a lack of genuine interest from the others, which leads to feelings of self-doubt and the belief that they might be wasting the other people's time. they even contemplate ceasing these interactions for the benefit of everyone involved. however, the fact that they still find happiness in these conversations and have the awareness to question their own perceptions suggests a level of social engagement and self-reflection that might indicate they are not experiencing deep loneliness. their ability to derive joy from interactions, even if perceived as trivial, and their awareness of the dynamics in their relationships are aspects that may be more typical of someone who is not deeply lonely."
feeling suicidal each and everydaycan anyone tell me how to cope up with these thoughts or any other solutions,0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of distress and a struggle with suicidal thoughts, which are serious mental health concerns. however, the request for coping mechanisms and solutions indicates a desire for connection and help. this proactive approach to seeking support suggests the individual is reaching out and does not necessarily feel isolated. their willingness to engage with others for advice and solutions can be seen as a sign of hope and a potential support network, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a critical need for mental health intervention rather than an inherent sense of loneliness."
Anyone here play destiny?I have a clan and I play with some members every once in a while but it's rare. If anyone wants to play send me a message,0,"the narrative describes an individual who is actively engaging in a social activity, namely playing the game destiny and being part of a clan. while the person mentions that playing with clan members is rare, the invitation for others to join indicates a proactive approach to social interaction. this willingness to reach out and connect with others, even if infrequent, suggests a level of social engagement that is not typically associated with loneliness. the individual's initiative to form new connections by inviting others to play further supports the idea that they are not experiencing significant feelings of isolation."

Anyone else have any hopes/ideas for your future? Things that you want to be able to do one day? Even if it may not seem possible/likely, just comment it :)",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of hope and aspiration for the future, with a strong desire to experience life through travel and personal growth. the individual discusses specific plans such as visiting various countries, engaging in activities like sightseeing and hiking, and pursuing new hobbies like film. despite acknowledging social challenges, the narrative focuses on overcoming these issues and connecting with others. the mention of recently securing a job and feeling both nervous and hopeful indicates a forward-looking mindset and a proactive approach to personal development. the inquiry about others' hopes and ideas for the future further suggests a desire for community and shared experiences, rather than isolation. these elements collectively point towards an individual who is not currently experiencing loneliness but is instead motivated by a positive outlook and a willingness to engage with the world."
"Watching friends on a live stream [sort of positivity]It was weird because on one hand it was enthralling to see my friends in real time playing their beautiful music but on the other hand, no one was interacting with me. It was a very lonely evening but I managed to feel okay with staying in. I looked at the rain outside and said I am warm. I looked at my friends playing their new album as the clock struck midnight and I sang along, I'll see them soon, and if I don't, I'll make other friends next year too. 

I only have a few friends, but really no one to lean on or fully trust. My relationships are either too new or old friends who just aren't really there. 

I think I've always had a difficult time with friends, either im too much like a puppy or I'm aloof and don't leave much of an impression. I'm emotional, I can be negative, I can pester. I know my loneliness isn't entirely my fault but I am going to try to be a better person to be around.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences mixed emotions while watching friends on a live stream. they acknowledge feelings of loneliness but also find solace in their environment and the music. despite mentioning a lack of close, dependable friends, they express optimism about forming new relationships in the future. they reflect on their personal challenges in maintaining friendships and recognize their own behaviors that might contribute to these difficulties. the individual shows self-awareness and a proactive attitude towards improving their social interactions, indicating a level of resilience and hopefulness. these aspects suggest a balanced perspective rather than one dominated by loneliness."
"Seems more and more likely that i will die by suicideEveryday that goes by makes me more likely to end it. No friends, no girl, shitty job, no money, depression and anxiety and schizotypal personality disorder. Why do I even bother anymore",0,"the narrative expresses profound despair and a range of serious mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and schizotypal personality disorder. the author mentions a lack of social connections and support, such as friends and a romantic partner, alongside dissatisfaction with their job and financial struggles. while these elements are often associated with loneliness, the overall tone and focus on suicidal ideation, mental illness, and existential hopelessness suggest that the primary issue may be more related to severe mental health challenges rather than loneliness itself. the narrative's emphasis on multiple compounding problems points to a broader context of psychological distress beyond just the experience of loneliness."
Shit Week[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a challenging period, but there is no explicit mention of feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the expression ""shit week"" conveys frustration and negativity, but it does not necessarily imply that the individual is experiencing loneliness. it's possible that the person is dealing with external stressors or temporary setbacks that are unrelated to their social life or sense of belonging. without additional context indicating a deeper sense of social disconnection or emotional isolation, the narrative appears to reflect a rough time rather than chronic loneliness."
"I am 23 and I never had the first kiss(23f) I am writing this with tears in my eyes. 
I am really socially awkward person. I had few crushes but with all of them I am just a close friend. I had my 23 birthday one month ago. The waves of loneliness are here these days. I realised that Ive never been on a date, neither had first kiss. I guess thats not the worst thing that could happen to you, but Im just really sad ????",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of sadness and social awkwardness, highlighted by the writer's tears and feelings of being left out of typical romantic experiences like dating and having a first kiss. the mention of being close friends with crushes but not progressing further indicates a desire for deeper connections that are not being fulfilled. the writer's reflection on their recent birthday amplifies their awareness of these unmet milestones. despite this, the narrative suggests an understanding that these experiences are not the worst possible outcomes, hinting at a broader perspective on their situation. while these feelings are significant, they may not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness but rather a situational sadness tied to specific unfulfilled social and romantic expectations."
Late night rantI just miss connecting with people. Life is hard enough and going through it alone just feels overwhelming. I feel hated by relatives. I just see my mom??s disgust and disapproval of me that I can see why no one would love me. In turn I feel a burning fire and I??m starting to hate her and the world. My rage and sadness keep repelling each other. More than anything I just need to be forgiven for my flaws and shortcomings. My mother expects so much out of me that I just can??t be. I can??t pour from an empty cup. All I??ve ever wanted from her and my father would be unconditional love ????,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional turmoil and a strained relationship with family members, particularly the mother. the individual expresses feelings of being overwhelmed and a desire for connection, which are common human experiences. however, despite the presence of sadness and frustration, there is no clear indication of pervasive loneliness. the longing for forgiveness and unconditional love suggests a desire for improved familial relationships rather than an overarching sense of isolation. the expression of rage and sadness indicates emotional complexity, but these emotions alone do not necessarily equate to loneliness. the narrative focuses more on specific interpersonal conflicts and unmet expectations rather than a broader experience of social disconnection."
"Endless DisappointmentI will never understand this, maybe I??m just too caring but certainly when someone supposedly loves the other, they??d be there for them and assist them no matter what right? Maybe I??m Tony Montana, in my own world, where in mine normal compassion, love and care exists, whereas in this world, it??s nonexistent. I??m there immediately for anyone in need, for whatever they may need, I provide to the best of my ability. But God forbid, I need the assistance, there??s stalling, excuses and straight up refusal. It makes no sense, it will never make sense. You love me but won??t help me when I need it but lo and behold, you need it, I??m on the case, post haste. It??s just so outrageous and depressing. It??s why I always say that being selfish isn??t a bad thing. Sticking to yourself is most important. Do not care for anyone else. Being a hero is very unrewarding, it??s why I take the role as villain and hero, mostly villain. Loneliness is a virtue.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disillusionment with the lack of reciprocity in relationships. the author expresses feelings of disappointment and outrage when their own needs are not met, despite their willingness to help others. this dynamic can lead to a sense of isolation, but the author seems to adopt a protective stance by advocating for selfishness and self-reliance. the use of strong language and the dichotomy of hero versus villain roles indicate a struggle with unmet expectations rather than a deep-seated loneliness. the emphasis on self-sufficiency and the rejection of caring for others suggest a coping mechanism to avoid further disappointment, rather than an indication of profound loneliness."
"HopefulI??m hoping everyone has a good weekend! 
I??m stuck at work this evening?? 
If you??re looking for someone to listen. 
Im available.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of optimism and engagement with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the author wishes others well and shows a willingness to connect by offering to listen, suggesting they feel socially capable and open. the mention of being stuck at work could indicate a temporary inconvenience rather than an emotional state of isolation. the tone is friendly and supportive, lacking any hints of sadness, despair, or disconnection that are commonly associated with loneliness. the overall context suggests the individual is involved and considerate of others, which aligns with feelings of social integration and contentment."
Thinking straight and coming to realization.[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a person who is experiencing clarity and self-awareness. phrases like ""thinking straight"" and ""coming to realization"" indicate a positive mental state where the individual is making sense of their thoughts and feelings. this sense of clarity is often associated with a balanced and content state of mind. typically, individuals who are lonely might express confusion, a lack of direction, or a sense of isolation in their narratives. the absence of such expressions here, along with the positive connotations of mental clarity and realization, suggests that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the focus on self-awareness and understanding further supports the idea of a stable and connected emotional state."
I literally have no one[removed],0,"the narrative indicates that the individual perceives themselves as having no one, which might initially suggest feelings of loneliness. however, the context and specific examples provided are crucial for a thorough assessment. the phrase ""i literally have no one"" could reflect a momentary feeling of isolation rather than a chronic state of loneliness. it is also possible that the individual is using hyperbole to express frustration or disappointment in a specific situation. relevant psychological insights highlight that loneliness is not just about the absence of social connections but also the subjective feeling of being disconnected. without further context or additional examples indicating a pervasive sense of emotional or social isolation, it is challenging to definitively conclude that the individual is experiencing loneliness. thus, the narrative may not exhibit typical indicators of chronic loneliness, such as long-term feelings of emptiness, social withdrawal, or a lack of meaningful relationships."
I give up on happinessThat's about it,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of resignation or surrender, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the phrase ""i give up on happiness"" suggests a state of emotional distress or perhaps a feeling of hopelessness. however, it lacks specific references to social isolation, a sense of being disconnected from others, or the absence of meaningful relationships, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the statement seems more focused on an individual's internal emotional state rather than their social experiences. without additional context about the person's social interactions or feelings of connectedness, it is difficult to definitively link this expression to loneliness. the brevity and lack of detail in the narrative further limit the ability to draw conclusions about the individual's social situation."
"Anyone else?It is not just me right?Always feel uncomfortable when people hug me and touch me,even they are my family or classmates.

Idk I always feel like a weirdo.",0,"the narrative reflects a discomfort with physical touch and a sense of feeling different from others, but these feelings alone do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions discomfort even with family and classmates, which could suggest personal boundaries or sensory sensitivities rather than social isolation. the phrase ""always feel uncomfortable"" points to a consistent pattern, but the use of ""weirdo"" indicates self-perception issues rather than a lack of social connections. while these feelings can contribute to loneliness, they are not definitive on their own. the context does not provide evidence of an absence of relationships or a desire for more meaningful connections, which are stronger indicators of loneliness."
"21M, feeling so lonely, idk what to do, it's getting worsePlease help me",0,"the narrative expresses a strong emotional plea for help, indicating a sense of distress and a feeling of worsening circumstances. however, the use of ""idk what to do"" suggests a momentary confusion rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. the brevity and urgency in the message might reflect an immediate emotional response rather than chronic loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include more detailed descriptions of long-term feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, and pervasive sadness. this narrative lacks those elements and instead presents a short, acute expression of distress that could stem from a variety of temporary situations rather than a sustained experience of loneliness."
"craving platonic love:i??m a senior in highschool &amp; i??m very lucky to have my girlfriend although; quarantine essentially broke my friend group apart. i feel isolated &amp; alone in the friend department, i miss all the fun times i had with them &amp; even though there was no toxic falling out, we just don??t talk anymore. i seem to be the only one trying to keep the friendships alive. after years of calling these few people my brothers &amp; sisters now it seems we??re nothing more than friendly strangers. they always lifted me up through the hard times in my life &amp; made sure i was happy and had everything i needed. being around a group of people that i can laugh with and be myself with is the most freeing feeling in my opinion, and i lost that. i just want them to all come together again &amp; at least text in our (old) groupchat. i want to know once all this lockdown stuff is over i??ll have them back in my life, regularly hanging out. one of them (not gonna use names) i??m particularly close with &amp; she??s sort of the heart of our group. it??s always her house we go to- and she??s been the most distant. she won??t even give me a response when i ask how she??s been, she takes hours to reply in the first place as well. i don??t want to seem desperate for her approval, but at the same time i AM desperate to know that she still values me as a close friend. so yeah, my situation may not be the worst of the worst- but it??s definitely provoking lots of feelings ranging from numb to straight up alone. i could use some advice.",0,"the narrative depicts an individual who is experiencing feelings of isolation due to the disintegration of a once close-knit friend group during quarantine. despite these feelings, the person is not exhibiting signs of deep loneliness but rather a sense of loss and nostalgia for past connections. the presence of a supportive girlfriend and the lack of a toxic fallout with friends suggest a stable support system and healthy relationships. the individual's proactive attempts to rekindle friendships and the desire for group cohesion indicate a temporary setback rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative reflects a yearning for social interaction and a normalcy disrupted by external circumstances, rather than an internal, pervasive sense of loneliness."
"[M4F] Paris, Valentines DayIt's a warm interesting day in Paris for Valentines day, what are you upto?",0,"the narrative describes a warm and interesting day in paris on valentine's day, and the author is inquiring about what the reader is up to. this indicates a sense of engagement and curiosity about another person's activities, which is a positive social interaction. the context of valentine's day, typically associated with love and companionship, further suggests that the author is in a setting where social connections are emphasized. the use of phrases like ""warm interesting day"" implies a positive and engaging environment. overall, the narrative lacks any indicators of isolation, sadness, or longing for connection, which are typical signs of loneliness. instead, it reflects a scenario where the author is socially active and interested in others' experiences, aligning with a state of non-loneliness."
"Having a popular roommate doesn't really help.Am in  college, and people are constantly knocking on my door asking for my roommate. I am always in the room so I have to answer to around twenty people ""HE IS NOT HERE"". This coupled with the fact that there is never anybody calling or coming around to ask about me, really sucks. AND THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION, HE LITERALLY HAS A GIRL IN THE ROOM RN AND THE LIGHTS ARE OFF...LOL",0,"the narrative describes a college student who is often interrupted by people looking for their popular roommate. despite these frequent interactions, the student expresses frustration that no one ever visits or calls for them. this situation could be interpreted as a source of irritation rather than an indication of loneliness. the student seems to be more annoyed by the inconvenience of having to deal with their roommate's popularity rather than expressing a deep sense of isolation or yearning for social connection. the mention of the roommate having a girl in the room with the lights off, followed by ""lol,"" suggests a level of detachment or even amusement rather than sadness or loneliness. the narrative lacks the emotional depth or explicit expressions of longing for companionship that are typically associated with loneliness."
21/M LF female to chat withHi there. I??m a 21/M looking to chat with a female around my age. I??m lonely and just want to chat. Hit me up :),0,"the narrative suggests a young man seeking companionship, specifically from a female around his age. while he mentions feeling lonely, the tone of the message appears casual and straightforward. the direct approach of looking for someone to chat with, rather than expressing deeper emotional distress or prolonged isolation, suggests a more situational and temporary feeling of loneliness rather than chronic or severe loneliness. the language used is light and the intention seems more aligned with social interaction rather than a cry for help, which indicates a lower level of psychological distress typically associated with loneliness. the brevity and simplicity of the message also imply that he is taking proactive steps to alleviate his current state by reaching out, which is not commonly seen in individuals experiencing significant loneliness."

How do I meet and befriend people? 
Even if I somehow start talking with a stranger what do I talk about if I do nothing and want nothing to do?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of detachment and lack of engagement in activities, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses a lack of interests and struggles with finding common ground with others, which can be typical of someone who is disinterested or apathetic rather than lonely. their mention of attending college, even though they skip classes, suggests they are in an environment where social interaction is possible, yet they choose not to engage. the narrative lacks expressions of emotional distress or a desire for connection, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on practical concerns about socializing without shared interests, highlighting a more pragmatic issue rather than an emotional one. this suggests that the author is more concerned with the logistics of forming relationships rather than feeling isolated or yearning for companionship."

"Find-a-friend with only 28 questions! A clever algorithm that covers age, gender, common interests (probably the best feature), continent ??????? , willingness to share pictures ???? or voice calls ????, studying/working status and more ???!Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

TLDR:

* Answer 28 questions
* Get matched with others based on answers + your interests
* Mostly everyone is from reddit

\---

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 5000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 5000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",0,"the narrative showcases a positive and enthusiastic tone about a friend-finding project designed to connect people based on shared interests and compatibility. the author highlights the efficiency and reach of the algorithm, emphasizing the large number of participants and the potential for forming meaningful connections. the detailed explanation of the process and the excitement about the project's features, such as anonymity and privacy, suggest a proactive approach to social interaction rather than a sense of isolation. the humorous and light-hearted remarks about the potential outcomes of friendships also indicate a sense of optimism and engagement with the community. overall, the narrative reflects an active and hopeful attitude towards making new friends, which is not typically associated with feelings of loneliness."
Girls help me ask out this girl I really like? dm?16\[m\],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of social engagement and a proactive approach to personal relationships, which are indicators that the individual is not experiencing loneliness. the author is seeking assistance from others in a community or social setting, indicating they have access to social support. the use of casual language and the direct request for help in a romantic endeavor further demonstrate a level of confidence and connection with peers. these elements are typically associated with someone who is socially integrated and actively participating in interpersonal interactions, rather than someone who is feeling isolated or disconnected."

I have been feeling lonely in my relationship and not the best feeling :(,0,"the narrative describes someone feeling lonely within their relationship and expressing a desire to talk about it. however, the presence of a relationship and the proactive approach of seeking conversation suggest a support system and a willingness to connect with others. while the individual experiences moments of loneliness, these feelings might be situational rather than chronic or pervasive. the use of a question mark and the invitation to talk indicate an openness to resolving their feelings, which is less typical of deep-seated loneliness where individuals often feel isolated and unable to reach out. the narrative reflects a temporary emotional state rather than a consistent experience of loneliness."
"I??m focusing on myself and nothing fucking happenedGeneric advice you??ve been getting on the internet that if you??re a lonely guy who has never dated or had a girlfriend is to ??focus on yourself?? and ??get hobbies?? and soon ??the girl will come when you least expect it.??

Well, I can say I??ve tried that. 

Almost every weekday I??m doing something. I play soccer on Mondays and Wednesday??s, I go for a social run on Tuesdays, I join an exercise group on Thursdays and guess what? For the past year I??ve done this, nothing??s happening. Where??s the girl I was told would come?

Sure, for the hour that I spend every time I do those activities, I may distract myself from feeling lonely, but at the final assessment, I??m still that one guy within those groups that doesn??t have a girlfriend, that one guy who can??t hold eye contact with a girl, that guy who is only doing all that to distract himself from the fact that he is lonely, who pretends the second pillow in his bed is his non-existent girlfriend, and cries himself to sleep some nights whenever the thought of him being a dateless wonder becomes overwhelming.

Is what I??m doing really not enough? Do I really need to devote more time and money on more hobbies?",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is actively engaging in various social and physical activities, such as playing soccer, going for social runs, and joining exercise groups. these activities indicate a proactive approach to self-improvement and social engagement. while the individual expresses frustration about not finding a romantic partner, the consistent participation in group activities suggests they are not isolated. the ability to articulate feelings of loneliness and seek solutions demonstrates a level of self-awareness and resilience. the narrative also shows that the person is taking advice to heart and making genuine efforts to change their situation, which is a positive sign of coping rather than succumbing to loneliness. despite the expressed dissatisfaction, the engagement in multiple social activities and the ability to reflect on their experiences are not typical indicators of severe loneliness."
"I will be alone until the day I dieSo here's a little backstory about 4 months ago I went on a date with this really cute girl I had a thing for and it went surprisingly well we had so many things in common and I felt like I finally found somebody that understood me however about last month I decided to ask her out again but but she told me she can because she will be on vacation with her parents which I completely understand but I did tried to message her every now and then and then I messaged her about 2 weeks ago just to see how she was and no response from her at all and it's been about 15 days without her getting back to me because my messages haven't been read and she also hasn't been online on messenger so then I decided to redownload the app where I met her and load and behold it said on her profile last active 1 day ago I had a fucking mental breakdown to the point where I almost destroyed everything in my apartment all I did was I got very drunk and cried all day while listening to a lot of depressing music it really hurts when you think you finally found somebody but in the end that's nothing but a lie I know I'm unlovable and will continue to be until the day I finally die.

I also sent her a message while I was drunk that I really regret already I hate myself.",0,"the narrative depicts a person who recently experienced a distressing situation involving a romantic interest. despite initially feeling a connection and excitement about the potential relationship, the individual faced rejection and subsequent lack of communication from the other party. this led to feelings of hurt, frustration, and self-loathing, culminating in a mental breakdown and self-destructive behavior. while these reactions are intense and indicative of emotional turmoil, they do not necessarily equate to chronic loneliness. the narrative focuses more on a specific incident of rejection rather than a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the person’s initial optimism about the date and the significant emotional response to the perceived betrayal suggest a capacity for connection and deep emotional engagement, which are not typical indicators of persistent loneliness."
"I feel extremely lonely when I'm with my close.family.I, 24m, am staying with my family of mom and sis, during the entirety of the COVID enforced lockdowns at my place. I'm not really used to spending so much time with them, as I grew up away from home (in residential schools) when I was 14 or so. Having an abandoned father didn't help much either for the dysfunctional family. Naturally, I felt more at ease and at home when I'm surronded by my friends than I felt when I was with family and relatives.

So, when I going back to my family, its like visiting a relative or something. The first few days its all well and good. But then later on, actual feelings start to surface. This deep melancholy and a feeling that I'm truly alone even though I'm with my close family. It gets worse when my mom starts to complain that I'm not smiling or talking much or whatever.

Now without any idea on how long I'm going to be locked up here, it gets even sadder day by day.",0,"the narrative describes a person feeling extreme loneliness despite being surrounded by close family during the covid lockdowns. the individual mentions not being accustomed to spending much time with family due to their upbringing in residential schools and an absent father, which contributed to a dysfunctional family dynamic. they express feeling more at home with friends than with family, indicating a lack of emotional connection and comfort with their relatives. the initial days with family are manageable, but deeper feelings of melancholy and loneliness emerge over time. the situation worsens as their mother notices and comments on their withdrawn behavior, further intensifying their sense of isolation. the uncertainty of the lockdown's duration adds to their sadness, highlighting the profound impact of their circumstances on their mental state."
Let??s be friends[removed],0,"the narrative suggests an invitation to friendship, which typically indicates a desire for social connection. however, the brevity and directness of the message, combined with the lack of emotional depth or context, do not necessarily imply loneliness. instead, it could reflect a straightforward and confident approach to forming new relationships. the absence of expressions of sadness, isolation, or yearning for companionship further supports this interpretation. overall, the narrative's tone and content are more consistent with someone who is socially proactive rather than experiencing loneliness."
"I??m not a good person and I can??t be happyI can??t feel happy, I just can??t. I have plenty of friends, a loving family, no traumatizing experiences that would have messed me up. I just dont understand what??s wrong with me. I can??t be the only one who feels like this. I always feel lonely too, like no one understands me. 

I??m not a good person either, my actions always effect others in a negative way. I always try to be better, I always try to stay away from drama and negativity , but then I always somehow end up being a part of it. I??m like a giant mass of toxicity that makes everything worse. I have so many friends and I treat them like sh*t, I don??t understand what??s wrong with me. 

I don??t know if I deserve to be happy.

Is there still hope for me, can I still be a good person. Someone please tell me I can still be a good person.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of self-doubt and a struggle with feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness. the author mentions having plenty of friends and a loving family, which suggests a supportive social environment. despite this, they feel persistently unhappy and lonely, which could indicate an internal struggle rather than an external lack of social connections. the repeated questioning of their worth and the impact of their actions on others points to a potential issue with self-esteem and self-perception. however, the presence of a supportive network and the absence of traumatic experiences are significant factors that typically mitigate feelings of profound loneliness. the author’s awareness of their negative feelings and their desire to change and be better are positive indicators of self-reflection and a willingness to improve. these aspects suggest that the author’s feelings of loneliness might be more related to their internal emotional state rather than a lack of social support or connection."
When I was in school I used to sit alone in lunch time everyday and no one cared. The few people that came to say something I couldn't hold the conversation and made them go awaynan,0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual sat alone during lunchtime at school and struggled with social interactions, which on the surface might suggest loneliness. however, it is important to consider that these experiences do not necessarily indicate current feelings of loneliness. the narrative is reflective and speaks about past events, and there is no explicit mention of ongoing feelings of isolation or distress related to those experiences. the lack of present emotional context and the absence of statements expressing current loneliness are key indicators that the individual may not be experiencing loneliness at this moment. additionally, the narrative does not convey any current desire for social connection or highlight any present difficulties in forming relationships, which are often significant indicators of loneliness. thus, while the described experiences are common among those who feel lonely, the narrative itself does not provide sufficient evidence of current loneliness."
"Cursed with WorthlessnessKnowing that I'm *objectively* not good enough for the life I wanted, yet people who are nasty to their bone somehow are.",0,"the narrative expresses a sense of worthlessness and frustration about not being good enough for a desired life, which can be common feelings for many individuals facing challenges or setbacks. however, the absence of references to isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that the primary issue here is more about self-worth and comparative dissatisfaction rather than loneliness. the focus is on the perceived injustice and personal inadequacy rather than on a longing for social interaction or companionship. these elements point towards internal struggles with self-esteem and external comparisons rather than the specific emotional experience of loneliness."
Looking for a christmas miracle[removed],0,"the narrative titled ""looking for a christmas miracle"" suggests a sense of hope and anticipation rather than loneliness. the phrase ""christmas miracle"" typically conveys a positive outlook and an expectation of something wonderful happening during the holiday season. this kind of optimism and belief in the possibility of miracles often reflects a mindset that is not characterized by loneliness. additionally, the context of christmas itself usually involves themes of togetherness, family, and communal celebration, which are contrary to feelings of isolation. the narrative does not exhibit signs of emotional distress, social withdrawal, or a longing for connection, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the festive spirit and the potential for positive change, underscoring an engaged and hopeful state of mind."
"I know a lot of other people suffer, but it??s hard not to feel alonenan",0,"the narrative reflects an awareness of others' suffering, which suggests a sense of empathy and connection to the broader human experience. the phrase ""i know a lot of other people suffer"" indicates that the individual is not entirely isolated in their perspective and recognizes the commonality of hardship. although the phrase ""it??s hard not to feel alone"" might initially suggest a feeling of isolation, the context implies a more nuanced understanding of personal struggle within a collective framework. this broader awareness and the ability to relate to others' experiences are typically less indicative of profound loneliness. the narrative does not exhibit intense feelings of isolation or disconnection that are often seen in those experiencing significant loneliness. instead, it shows a balanced perspective that acknowledges both personal and shared challenges."
"I just wanna know...I just wanna know what it feels like for someone to care for you dearly. Love you like no other on this earth. 
I just wanna know what it's like to embrace someone's warmth; a tight and welcoming hug. 
I just wanna know what it's like for someone to be there for you during your lows and highs. 

I just want... I just wanna be loved. Sigh",0,"the narrative expresses a deep yearning for connection and affection, which can be common in many individuals regardless of whether they are experiencing loneliness. the repeated use of ""i just wanna know"" indicates a curiosity or desire rather than an active state of loneliness. the author speaks about wanting to feel cared for and loved, which are universal human desires. the mention of specific acts of affection, like hugs and support during highs and lows, suggests a longing for these experiences rather than a reflection on their absence. the sigh at the end conveys a sense of wistfulness rather than despair. overall, the narrative highlights a strong desire for love and connection, which is a natural human sentiment and not necessarily indicative of loneliness."
"Have you??ve been lonely sorrunded by a lot of people?Just been to a party today. With the sole objective to get out of my comfort zone and i??ve felt nothing the whole time, even when people tried talking to me. I really don??t know what to do next, my time there was just a bunch of bad toughts that i couldn??t get out of my head, maybe im just to drunk to think straight but again, i don??t know what to do??",0,"the narrative describes an individual attending a party and feeling disconnected despite being surrounded by people. this experience of emotional detachment, even in social settings, can be indicative of underlying issues such as social anxiety or depression rather than loneliness. the mention of trying to step out of their comfort zone and the persistent negative thoughts suggest an internal struggle with self-perception and possibly low self-esteem. the individual's awareness of their state and their contemplation about being too drunk to think straight indicate a momentary confusion rather than a chronic sense of isolation. while the feelings expressed are significant and warrant attention, they do not align specifically with the pervasive and enduring sense of loneliness typically characterized by a deep longing for meaningful social connections."
What's the point?[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a sense of existential questioning rather than loneliness. the phrase ""what is the point?"" suggests a search for meaning or purpose, which can be a common human experience not necessarily tied to feelings of loneliness. the brevity and directness of the statement indicate a moment of introspection or philosophical pondering rather than an emotional expression of isolation. in cases of loneliness, one might expect more detailed expressions of social disconnection, feelings of being misunderstood, or a longing for companionship. here, the focus is on the broader existential inquiry, which aligns more with a contemplation of life's purpose rather than an emotional state of loneliness."
"Enjoy talking with new people.Anyone want to chat? Any topic? If you need to vent, or an outside perspective",0,"the narrative expresses an openness and enthusiasm for engaging with others, which suggests a sense of social connectedness and comfort in social interactions. the invitation to chat on any topic and willingness to provide support or an outside perspective indicates a proactive approach to socializing and helping others, which is generally inconsistent with feelings of loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness may express a sense of isolation, reluctance to reach out, or a lack of confidence in forming new connections. the positive and inviting tone of this narrative points towards an individual who feels socially integrated and confident in their ability to connect with others."
friends?[deleted],0,"the narrative appears to lack detailed content, as indicated by the ""[deleted]"" tag, which often suggests the original message was removed by the author. the presence of a simple and ambiguous term like ""friends?"" without further elaboration does not provide substantial evidence of loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might express feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or explicit mentions of being alone. the absence of such emotional indicators or descriptive language in this brief and incomplete narrative suggests that it does not convey the depth of emotion or context usually associated with loneliness. thus, the narrative does not present the typical markers of someone experiencing loneliness."
Happy birthday to myself!Today I am 19 years old,0,"the narrative suggests a positive and self-celebratory tone, which typically indicates a state of non-loneliness. the phrase ""happy birthday to myself!"" shows self-acknowledgment and a willingness to celebrate personal milestones. turning 19 is often a significant event, and the exclamation marks imply excitement and happiness. there is no mention of negative emotions, isolation, or a lack of social connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on the joy of the birthday itself, suggesting that the individual feels content and possibly supported in their life. the absence of any longing for companionship or expressions of sadness further supports the notion that the person is not experiencing loneliness."
I am just so tired of it.I am so sick and tired. It never goes away. I am just so fucking tired of it all. It's just so fucking exhausting. Every damn day.,0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of exhaustion and frustration, which are emotions that can stem from various sources other than loneliness. the repetition of phrases like ""so tired"" and ""so fucking tired"" indicates a deep level of weariness, but it does not necessarily point to social isolation or a lack of meaningful connections with others. the focus is on the overwhelming and persistent nature of the fatigue, suggesting that the individual's distress might be related to ongoing stress, burnout, or another form of emotional or physical strain. the absence of any mention of feeling isolated, disconnected, or lacking companionship supports the interpretation that the primary issue here is not loneliness but rather an intense, possibly chronic, state of exhaustion."

",0,"the narrative describes an individual who, despite feeling depressed and bored, expresses a clear interest in social interaction and a variety of activities that they enjoy. the person mentions their hobbies, such as gaming with friends and bicycling, which are social and outdoor activities that indicate a connection to others and to nature. they also find solace in the calming effects of nature, which suggests a coping mechanism for their feelings. their willingness to engage in conversation with others, regardless of age or gender, further shows an openness to social interaction. these aspects collectively suggest that while the individual may be experiencing temporary feelings of boredom and low mood, they are not isolated or disconnected from their social environment or interests, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"I want a group of friends to play games and fuck around with.I used to have some online friends that I would play games with but we drifted apart. I mainly just liked the jokes we came up with, much more than the games. I want that now but I don??t share a sense of humor with most people and I whine about not having friends instead of looking for them. But when I try to look for them I realize how much I hate people.",0,"the narrative describes a desire for social connection and enjoyment of past friendships, highlighting a preference for shared humor and playful interactions. while there is a sense of loss regarding previous online friends, the author does not express deep feelings of isolation or despair typically associated with loneliness. instead, there is a self-aware acknowledgment of their own behavior, such as whining about not having friends and a contradictory dislike for people when trying to make new connections. this self-awareness and the focus on specific preferences in social interactions suggest a nuanced view of their social situation rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the narrative reflects a challenge in finding compatible friends rather than an overarching feeling of loneliness."
"I feel feel lonely, but I want isolation. Why?I feel lonely, but I want isolation. In reality, I am fortunate and have a loving circle full of amazing human beings, from my family, to my friends, and coworkers. But still, I feel lonely and  want to time to myself. How do I go about understanding my emotions? I am so grateful for life but I still I feel lonely.",0,"the narrative expresses a paradoxical desire for isolation despite having a supportive and loving social circle, which suggests a complex emotional state rather than chronic loneliness. the individual acknowledges the presence of family, friends, and coworkers, indicating strong social connections and a sense of gratitude for these relationships. the repeated mention of feeling lonely could be indicative of situational or transient loneliness rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the desire for time alone might reflect a need for self-reflection or personal space rather than an absence of social bonds. this distinction is crucial, as it highlights the person's awareness of their emotions and the supportive environment they are part of, which are not typical indicators of chronic loneliness."
"How do you communicate if your head is empty all the time?I literally have nothing to talk about and if I do, it's hurtful things.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and introspection about communication difficulties. the individual mentions feeling like their head is empty, which could suggest a lack of stimulating thoughts or ideas, but this alone does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the concern about having nothing to talk about and the fear that the few things they do think of are hurtful might point to issues with self-expression or social anxiety. however, there is no direct mention of feelings of isolation, longing for connection, or emotional pain typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus is on the content of their thoughts and the potential negative impact of their communication, which may relate more to self-criticism or social discomfort rather than loneliness."
Available to chat25 M California. Willing to chat with someone. Kinda feel like we all need some form of companionship.,0,"the narrative expresses a willingness to engage in conversation and acknowledges a universal need for companionship, but it does not exhibit signs of acute loneliness. the author mentions a general desire for interaction rather than a personal or emotional struggle with isolation. the phrase ""we all need some form of companionship"" indicates an understanding of human social needs rather than an immediate personal deficit. there is no indication of distress or urgency that often accompanies feelings of loneliness. the casual and open tone suggests a balanced perspective on social interaction, rather than an expression of loneliness."
unlovedi never learned how to love anyone. girls come and go fast because when they like me i feel cringey and weird and leave. never had a real relationship yet crave it quite a lot,0,"the narrative describes an individual who experiences difficulty in forming and maintaining romantic relationships. while there is a sense of frustration and a desire for a meaningful connection, the person's feelings of discomfort and awkwardness when someone shows interest suggest issues with intimacy rather than loneliness. the craving for a real relationship indicates a longing for emotional connection, but the transient nature of their interactions and the self-awareness of their emotional responses point towards a struggle with vulnerability and self-acceptance. these factors are more indicative of relational challenges and personal growth issues rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
Sometimes the endless stream of ??Wholesome Couples Content?? I see on Instagram just kills meI actually cannot accept that some people get to experience this,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and perhaps envy towards the romantic relationships displayed on social media, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual expresses discomfort with the constant exposure to ""wholesome couples content"" and struggles with accepting that others have these experiences. however, this sentiment alone does not imply a deeper sense of isolation or lack of social connections. it is possible that the person has a supportive social network but feels a specific dissatisfaction related to romantic relationships. the absence of broader themes of social disconnection, such as a lack of friends or meaningful interactions, suggests that the individual's experience is more about specific frustrations rather than an overarching sense of loneliness."
No one actually wants to talk to me.[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a feeling of social isolation, but it's important to note that such statements can sometimes reflect a temporary state of mind rather than a persistent condition of loneliness. the phrase ""no one actually wants to talk to me"" could indicate a moment of frustration or a misinterpretation of social interactions. individuals might feel this way after a particular incident or during a period of low self-esteem. however, the absence of additional context or repeated themes of disconnection and emotional pain in the narrative makes it less indicative of chronic loneliness. people experiencing loneliness often express a deeper, ongoing sense of emptiness and a lack of meaningful connections, rather than a singular statement of perceived rejection. it's crucial to differentiate between transient feelings of being ignored and the more pervasive, long-term experience of loneliness that affects overall mental health and well-being."
Anyone else make lots of there posts at night so they have notifications to wake up to?nan,0,"the narrative suggests a behavior of posting at night with the intention of having notifications to wake up to. this behavior could be interpreted as seeking social interaction or validation. however, the context does not provide enough evidence of deeper emotional distress or feelings of isolation that typically characterize loneliness. the individual may simply enjoy the engagement and interaction that comes from receiving notifications. without further indications of sadness, isolation, or a lack of meaningful connections, this behavior alone does not strongly suggest loneliness. instead, it might reflect a preference for social media engagement and the pleasure derived from social interactions."
Can't sleep...Anyone has a hard time sleeping when you're alone/ missing someone??,0,"the narrative suggests difficulty sleeping and questions whether others experience the same issue when alone or missing someone. this indicates a temporary state of restlessness rather than a chronic sense of loneliness. the mention of missing someone points to a specific cause for the sleeplessness, implying that the individual's distress is situational and tied to a particular person or event. this is different from the pervasive and persistent feeling of loneliness, which tends to be more generalized and not necessarily linked to a specific cause. the language used does not convey a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation or disconnection from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, it reflects a momentary struggle that many people can relate to, suggesting that the individual is not experiencing loneliness in a broader sense."
"everyone is fakemy ex best friends blocked me and also managed to convince our other best friend to block me. genuinely wanna know what she said to convince her to do it, bc as far as i??m concerned this was not my fault. i didn??t do anything to either of them but i??m getting blocked. especially by our other best friend. all they both do is talk shit abt each other behind the other??s back so i wish them a long fulfilling friendship, i wanna see how long they??ll last.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of betrayal and frustration towards former friends, but it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses anger and confusion about being blocked by their ex-best friends, which suggests a conflict rather than isolation. they mention a desire to understand what was said to convince the other friend to block them, indicating a focus on the specifics of the fallout rather than feelings of loneliness. the sarcastic wish for the former friends to have a long-lasting friendship further underscores the author's emotional reaction to the situation. while the narrative highlights interpersonal conflict and negative emotions, it lacks the hallmark signs of loneliness, such as feelings of deep isolation, longing for connection, or pervasive sadness about being alone. the author seems more preoccupied with the injustice and drama of the situation rather than expressing a profound sense of loneliness."
I don??t wanna live if this is gonna be my lifeI met a guy two weeks ago and he showed interest in me. Now he acts like I don??t exist. He doesn??t talk to me only if others are around me or if he needs something from me. He used me and this hurts me so much because I believed for once that I was pretty and that I??m actually worth something but I guess not. I??m tired of always having to go through cycles like this. I have a nice personality and I try my best to look physically attractive so i don??t understand why I have yet to have a boyfriend. I have so much love to give and no one wants it.,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional pain and frustration due to unreciprocated romantic interest and feelings of worthlessness. the writer describes a recent encounter with someone who initially showed interest but later acted indifferent, which has caused significant hurt. the individual expresses confusion and disappointment about their efforts to be attractive and kind not leading to a meaningful relationship. while the narrative contains elements of sadness and self-doubt, it also shows a desire for connection and love, which are natural human experiences. the feelings expressed, although painful, do not necessarily indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness but rather a situational response to a specific rejection. the narrative focuses more on the disappointment of unmet expectations in romantic relationships rather than a broader sense of social isolation or chronic loneliness."
"I wish I could experience sex, kissing, cuddling, and hugs. I am so touch deprived it??s crazy!nan",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical affection and touch, which is a common human need. however, the absence of explicit emotional distress or a deeper sense of social isolation suggests that the author may not be experiencing profound loneliness. instead, the focus is primarily on the physical aspect of human connection rather than a broader emotional or social disconnection. the lack of additional context about their social relationships or emotional state also makes it difficult to conclude that the author is experiencing significant loneliness. they may simply be expressing a normal, albeit unmet, need for physical touch without the accompanying feelings of isolation or despair typically associated with loneliness."
"Laying down, wondering what could've beenWhat if I talked to her? What if I talked to them? What if I wasn't afraid? What if I was interesting enough?

Laying down in the dark, alone in a silent room really drills in the fact that nobody really knows me, cares for me as you see people care for each other. Friendship seems like a distant opportunity I lost many times over just because I am afraid that I'll never be enough.

What's fascinating is that there's billions of people around the globe and still I haven't convinced even just one person that I could be a proper friend. How could I? Am I even capable? Everything's just complicated and I think I'll always be afraid.

Sorry, just needed to let some thoughts out. If for some bizarre reason this is read, have a pleasant day to you stranger!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep introspection and self-doubt, with the author expressing regret over missed opportunities for connection and a pervasive fear of inadequacy. the mention of laying down in a dark, silent room suggests a physical and emotional isolation. the author questions their ability to form friendships and feels disconnected from others, highlighting a perceived lack of care and understanding from those around them. despite the narrative's somber tone and the author's feelings of being perpetually afraid and inadequate, it ends with a courteous wish for the reader, which could indicate a glimmer of hope or an inherent kindness. the expression of these thoughts could be a form of catharsis, suggesting a moment of vulnerability rather than a chronic state of loneliness."
"I Really want a girl best friend.I Really want a girl best friend that's mature enough to just tell the Truth and not try and spread lies and rumors like most guys and girls I've meet. I would say a guy best friend, but most guys I meet I'm nothing like at all, all I ever hear when I'm around other guys are them talking about ""how many bodies they have"" like their supposed to be some kinda pimp or something. I'm not jealous at all, I'm sickened by it because they don't understand Real Intimacy and that sex is a sacred intimate experience that should only be shared with someone you TRULY LOVE. I'm tired of hanging out with guys because most of them are obsessed with sex, I want a Real girl best friend for once, one that's mature enough to not lie to me or do anything manipulative, someone that I can vent to, possibly someone to work out with, someone to just go out and have fun with as a best friend, someone that'll motivate me to be a better version of myself while I do the same for her.",0,"the narrative expresses a clear desire for a meaningful and authentic friendship, particularly with a girl best friend who embodies maturity and honesty. the author contrasts their values with those of the guys they have encountered, who seem preoccupied with superficial aspects of relationships. while there is a sense of dissatisfaction with their current social circle, the narrative focuses on the aspiration for a deeper connection rather than expressing feelings of isolation or loneliness. the author is articulate about what they seek in a friendship, emphasizing mutual growth, support, and genuine intimacy. this proactive approach to seeking a fulfilling relationship suggests a hopeful and goal-oriented mindset rather than one dominated by loneliness. the specificity of their desires and the absence of expressions of emotional distress or social isolation are key indicators that the narrative does not reflect a state of loneliness."
"Hey, someone wanna talk?It??s Saturday and I don??t have anyone to talk to right now so whose up for a conversation? :)",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction, but it lacks the deeper emotional cues typically associated with loneliness. the writer's tone is casual and open, indicating a simple wish to chat rather than a profound sense of isolation. phrases like ""whose up for a conversation?"" convey a light-hearted approach to finding someone to talk to, rather than a plea born out of desperation or sadness. the use of a smiley face at the end further implies a positive and friendly disposition. overall, the narrative reflects a momentary need for companionship rather than chronic loneliness."
"Why do I feel so different sometimes?During the day when I'm at school or out with friends I usually feel okay, with moments of sudden loneliness or sadness (depends on who I'm around/what's going on) which I can usually hide, but every night without fail I just feel awful. It's like my personality shifts and I just become extremely depressed. I know I'm extremely lucky to have people around me who care, and I care about them too, but at night I just feel so alone. Things like video games can help but I just end up losing motivation and not being able to play them. It's been like this for a long time and I'm very afraid of reaching out because not only would it be hard to explain to friends, and extremely hard to family, but it would also put a financial strain on them if I had to start therapy or get medicine. Part of me feels like being in a relationship would help but I think I'm pretty hopeless there. If anyone has any ideas please let me know, the suicidal thoughts have really been ramping up these past few months and I'm scared. I'm sorry if this post was all over the place I just need to get everything out.",0,"the narrative describes a person who experiences fluctuating feelings of loneliness and sadness, particularly at night. despite having a supportive social circle and engaging in activities like video games, the individual struggles with feelings of isolation and depression. they express a fear of reaching out for help due to potential financial burdens and difficulty explaining their emotions to loved ones. the narrative also mentions an increase in suicidal thoughts, indicating a severe emotional distress. while the individual acknowledges the care they receive from friends and family, their persistent night-time loneliness and hopelessness about relationships suggest a deep-seated emotional struggle. these elements highlight the complexity of their feelings and the barriers they face in seeking help, which are significant indicators of their emotional state."

All that I want is her back but I'm so stupid to do it. I think I will just remember the good times that I had and stay happy for a bit, then come back to my loliness and my sadness.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of loss and regret, which can often be associated with feelings of loneliness. however, the individual is focused on their past actions and the consequences of those actions, which indicates a more situational form of sadness rather than chronic loneliness. the mention of wanting the person back and the acknowledgment of having had good times suggest that the individual has experienced meaningful connections and is capable of forming relationships. their self-awareness and ability to reflect on their behavior are also signs of someone who is not chronically lonely but rather going through a period of emotional turmoil. the temporary nature of their sadness, as they mention coming back to it, implies that their loneliness is not a constant state but rather a reaction to a specific event."
Why post?The title thing. Answer it.,0,"the narrative reflects a terse and somewhat cryptic expression, lacking any detailed context or emotional depth that might indicate loneliness. the brevity and straightforwardness of the message suggest a practical or perhaps indifferent attitude rather than one of isolation or yearning for connection. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might express feelings of sadness, longing, or a desire for interaction, none of which are present in this narrative. instead, the focus appears to be on a simple, almost mechanical inquiry, which aligns more with a dispassionate or neutral state of mind. the absence of personal reflection or emotional cues further supports the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
Friend ghosted meI knew him for a year or two I opened up to him I know he??s active but he never talks to me,0,"the narrative describes an experience of being ghosted by a friend, which can be distressing but does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual mentions knowing the friend for a year or two and having opened up to them, which suggests a level of social interaction and connection. while the lack of communication from the friend is troubling, the narrative does not provide evidence of broader social isolation or a lack of meaningful relationships. the focus is on a specific incident rather than a pervasive feeling of being alone or disconnected from others. this suggests that the individual may have other social supports and is experiencing a situational rather than chronic emotional response."
Everyone just left?[deleted],0,"the narrative suggests an abrupt departure of others, but there is no clear indication of loneliness. the phrasing ""everyone just left?"" implies surprise or confusion, which might be due to an unexpected situation rather than a feeling of isolation. the brevity of the statement and the lack of emotional depth or expression of distress do not point to a sense of loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include descriptions of persistent feelings of emptiness, longing for connection, or emotional pain from social isolation. in this case, the narrative lacks such elements and seems more situationally puzzled rather than indicative of an underlying emotional state of loneliness."
"One sided friendshipsSo basically i did a thing where i stop texting everyone and see how long it will be until someone texts me forst. 2 weeks go by, play sea of theives and apex by myself. 4 weeks go by, nothing. So basically, nobody talks to me unlrss i start it. So quarantine is awesome",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the author stops initiating contact with friends to see if they will reach out first. despite not receiving any messages for weeks, the tone suggests a level of acceptance or even a hint of sarcasm about the situation, particularly with the phrase ""so quarantine is awesome."" the author mentions playing games alone but does not express distress or sadness about the lack of communication. instead, there is a sense of observation and perhaps an experiment-like approach to understanding their social dynamics. the absence of explicit feelings of isolation, sadness, or yearning for connection indicates that the author might not be experiencing loneliness. they seem to be reflecting on their social interactions without emotional turmoil, which is not typical of someone who feels lonely."
Got broken up with today. Honestly the last three days saw it coming. Don??t really know why.nan,0,"the narrative describes a recent breakup, which is a significant emotional event, but it lacks indicators typically associated with loneliness. the individual mentions that they anticipated the breakup over the last few days, suggesting a level of emotional preparedness. there is no mention of pervasive feelings of isolation, disconnection from others, or a sense of emptiness that often accompanies loneliness. instead, the focus is on the specific event of the breakup and the confusion surrounding the reasons behind it. the absence of broader reflections on their social connections or feelings of being alone suggests that the individual may still have a support system or other relationships that mitigate feelings of loneliness. the narrative is more centered on processing a singular emotional incident rather than expressing a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness."
Need an adviceI want to talk about it. Please. Im tired of botteling up :(,0,"the narrative expresses a desire to talk and seek advice, indicating a proactive approach to addressing personal feelings. while the individual mentions being tired of bottling up emotions, the act of reaching out for help suggests they are not isolated or withdrawn. this willingness to communicate and seek support is generally not characteristic of loneliness, as lonely individuals often struggle to connect with others and may feel a sense of hopelessness or resignation. the use of the word ""please"" also implies an expectation of empathy and assistance, further indicating that the person believes in the possibility of finding relief through social interaction. overall, the narrative reflects an openness to engage with others rather than the isolation typically associated with loneliness."
When you break up with a long time significant otherTheres just so much fucking *stuff* like I really have to sort through this shit and remember all the beautiful memories we made before you fell out of love with me i cant do this shit no more man im so exhausted you got me so fucked up i cant,0,"the narrative describes the aftermath of a breakup, focusing on the emotional turmoil and exhaustion that follows. while the author expresses strong feelings of frustration and fatigue, these emotions are specifically tied to the recent end of a relationship rather than a broader sense of loneliness. the mention of sorting through memories and feeling ""fucked up"" highlights the immediate pain of loss and betrayal, but there is no indication of a prolonged or pervasive sense of isolation. the narrative is more about dealing with the acute stress and emotional upheaval of a breakup rather than chronic loneliness. the intensity of the emotions described is situational, linked to the breakup rather than an ongoing experience of feeling alone or disconnected from others."
"Is there any chat here?Pardon my ignorance I have almost never used reddit before. But I'm thinking about maybe starting because.. well... you can probably guess if you're here. But I read somewhere that reddit had started group chat features? Is that for every subreddit? Are they always available? Does this group have one? Do I have to do something myself to start one?  


I find most chat rooms online are f'ing awful. Mostly teenagers looking to hook up or people hunting for naked pics. Or random racists or idiots or trolls posting nonsense. SPAM bots. Girls trying to sell cam shows. Assholes. and so on. Pretty much exclusively. I thought maybe if there were communities based around common interests like you find on reddit they could have chat rooms that weren't quite so chaotic, toxic, and predatory. But I don't know where to find those.",0,"the narrative reflects curiosity and exploration of social platforms rather than a sense of isolation. the author expresses a clear intent to engage with a community based on shared interests, which suggests an active effort to connect rather than a feeling of disconnection. their frustration with other chat rooms seems to stem from a desire for meaningful interaction rather than from loneliness. the questions posed about reddit’s features indicate a proactive approach to finding a suitable environment, which is typical of someone seeking better social experiences rather than expressing a sense of being alone. the narrative does not contain expressions of sadness, longing for companionship, or other emotional cues often associated with loneliness. instead, it shows a pragmatic approach to finding a community that aligns with their interests."

"Feeling lonely, low, defeated and smallAnyone wanna talk to me?",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and a desire for social interaction, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the use of the phrase ""anyone wanna talk to me?"" indicates an active attempt to reach out and connect with others. this proactive behavior suggests that the individual is not completely isolated and is making efforts to engage socially. individuals experiencing severe loneliness often feel helpless or hopeless about their social situation and may not take steps to seek out interaction. the willingness to communicate and the direct request for conversation are indicators that the person has not fully succumbed to the depths of loneliness, as they are still seeking connection and support."
"Anyone just want to talk/message?To preface this, I??m just a 19 year old guy who has just been dealing with some stuff lately. Safe to say I have not been doing so well and I have a lot of stuff I??ve been holding in for a long time because I just don??t have anyone to talk to. No close friends. Not much close family. If anyone just wants to talk about some things they??ve been dealing with, or talk in general I??m down. I??m just tired of being lonely and I wish I could get at least some stuff off my chest. I??m also more than willing to just lend an ear as well. I know there are other people who need someone who??ll just listen or acknowledge them as well. I consider myself to be a good listener so if you have stuff to talk about or just want someone to talk to about anything I??ll listen.",0,"the narrative depicts a young individual who expresses a desire for communication and connection. they mention dealing with personal challenges and a lack of close friends or family, which are often indicators of loneliness. however, the overall tone suggests a proactive approach to addressing their feelings. the willingness to listen to others and offer support indicates a level of social engagement and empathy. despite acknowledging their own struggles, they show an awareness of others' needs, which can be a sign of resilience and a balanced perspective. this combination of seeking connection while offering support may reflect a situational difficulty rather than chronic loneliness. the narrative suggests a temporary state of disconnection rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness."

Oh wait can??t blame any other factor except ??muh personality?? forgot",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and self-blame regarding romantic rejections. the author discusses being rejected and observing that the individuals they are interested in often choose ""tall white guys."" while there is an element of self-criticism, it lacks deeper expressions of emotional isolation or a pervasive sense of being disconnected from others, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on external factors and perceived societal preferences, rather than an introspective look at feelings of solitude or a lack of meaningful connections. this suggests that the author's primary concern is about specific romantic rejections rather than a broader experience of loneliness."
Valentine's Day sucks. I fall for my friends online too easily. I barely have any in real life since high school graduation.so tired of having emotions lol.,0,"the narrative expresses a general frustration with valentine's day and a tendency to form emotional attachments online. the mention of falling for friends online too easily could indicate a search for connection, but it does not necessarily imply loneliness. the writer also references having few friends since high school graduation, which might suggest a limited social circle, yet this alone doesn't confirm feelings of loneliness. the casual tone and the phrase ""so tired of having emotions lol"" suggest a more lighthearted or resigned attitude rather than deep emotional distress. overall, the narrative lacks the depth of isolation or despair typically associated with loneliness, indicating the writer may simply be venting about their situation without experiencing profound loneliness."
Goodbye foreverYou know all I wanted in the end was a girlfriend. I have so many reasons I want to kill myself. People are trash in this world and they treat me like I'm inferior and not good enough. I'm just gonna do it I'm done. So bye. No point in getting into all the details on why I want to kill myself. I've just had it. Goodbye forever.,0,"the narrative expresses deep feelings of despair and hopelessness, with a clear indication of suicidal ideation. the author mentions a strong desire for a girlfriend and perceives themselves as treated inferiorly by others, which points to significant social rejection and low self-worth. however, the absence of detailed exploration into feelings of isolation or lack of meaningful connections suggests that the primary issue may not be loneliness but rather a broader sense of personal failure and social inadequacy. the narrative focuses more on self-perception and external validation rather than the emotional experience of being alone or disconnected from others. this indicates that the root cause of their distress might be more related to self-esteem and existential concerns rather than loneliness per se."
LonelinessAm bored I need someone to cart me up,0,"the narrative describes a feeling of boredom and a desire for someone to ""cart me up,"" which may suggest a temporary state of inactivity or a need for engagement rather than chronic loneliness. the use of the word ""bored"" indicates a situational feeling that can be resolved through external stimulation or activity. there is no mention of deeper emotional pain, prolonged isolation, or a sense of disconnection from others, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the phrase ""i need someone"" might imply a desire for company, but it lacks the depth of longing or emotional distress often associated with loneliness. overall, the narrative points to a transient state of boredom rather than an enduring experience of loneliness."

"Be productiveIn my experience, I??ve found that one of the best ways to cope with being lonely is just to get shit done. Clean your room, do some homework, run some errands etc. you??ll feel much better afterwards trust me",0,"the narrative suggests a proactive and solution-oriented mindset, focusing on practical steps to improve one's mood and well-being. the individual emphasizes productivity as a coping mechanism, which indicates a sense of control and purpose. the advice to clean, do homework, and run errands reflects an understanding of how staying busy can combat negative emotions. the tone is confident and reassuring, suggesting the person has successfully used these strategies and is sharing them to help others. this approach aligns with psychological insights that staying active and engaged can mitigate feelings of loneliness, implying that the individual may not be experiencing significant loneliness themselves."

"I want to fall in loveMaybe that sounds a lil cliche, but I really do wanna fall in love. I have friends who have kids now, and some just got married. I??ve had a few opportunities to start something with a couple of people, not at the same time of course, but I just didn??t feel any chemistry .I??ve felt what it??s like to ??like?? someone , but they don??t even give me that feeling either. Idk if there??s something wrong with me, or if I have my standards too high. I??ve had 3 relationships in the past and they weren??t that great, I never liked how I felt or how I was treated , so I avoid anyone who shows the type of red flags that remind me of those relationships . I just want something raw, passionate, and just real I guess. I feel like I??m ready for something like that, but I just can??t really seem to find anyone with the same wavelengths . Plus, I just havnt met anyone who??s given me the slightest bit of ??butterflies?? in almost 3.5 years now. I??ve just been vibing with myself all this time and now I have like a billion hobbies, but fuck I want to do all these things I learned with someone . I guess it??s not a necessity, but it??s something that would bring me more joy.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of longing for romantic connection and companionship, but it is characterized more by a hopeful pursuit rather than a deep-seated loneliness. the individual speaks about having friends and maintaining an active social life, as evidenced by their awareness of friends getting married and having children. while they express a desire for a meaningful and passionate relationship, they do not convey a pervasive sense of isolation or disconnection from others. instead, they seem to be introspective about their past relationships and cautious about repeating past mistakes, which suggests a level of self-awareness and emotional resilience. the mention of having ""a billion hobbies"" indicates that they have found ways to engage and entertain themselves, which is a healthy coping mechanism and a sign of a well-rounded life. overall, the narrative points to someone who is seeking deeper emotional fulfillment but is not overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness."
"What do the lonely eat?This sounds dumb but I??m serious. 

Today, I had a ton of pancakes, solo road food, now homemade cookies and later a steak and potatoes. All on my beautiful couch, by myself, in a house where even with the tab and music on it is still so quiet, and the quiet is louder than packed bar at midnight. A bar where all your friends are gone, your ride is gone and you??re just killing time as you dissolve into nothing in the frothy fun splashing of everyone else, until your friends find you and the bizarre solo float in the sea of people is over. It??s not over for us, and it??s midnight at this shitty bar, and we gotta order something.

I don??t have appetizers, try a bite of friend??s food, share a plate of something made for two, or feel compelled to eat what normal people eat. 

I??m alone on the road through this wasteland, and today I ate pancakes, chocolate chip cookies and steak. 

What did you eat? (Or what are you going to eat?)",0,"the narrative reflects a vivid description of an individual's eating habits and their experience of solitude. the writer describes their meals in a detailed manner, highlighting the variety and enjoyment of different foods, such as pancakes, cookies, and steak. they also mention sitting on a beautiful couch and the ambiance of their house, which suggests a certain level of comfort and contentment in their environment. while the quietness of the house is noted, it is contrasted with the noise of a packed bar, implying a preference for solitude over chaotic social settings. the narrative also touches on the idea of eating alone, but without any negative connotation or distress typically associated with loneliness. instead, the focus remains on the personal enjoyment of food and the solitary experience, suggesting a sense of independence and self-sufficiency rather than loneliness. the writer's curiosity about others' eating habits further indicates an interest in connection and sharing experiences, which does not align with the typical indicators of loneliness."
"Obligatory ""it's my birthday and no one cares"" postI don't know it's just another day",0,"the narrative expresses a sentiment of indifference towards the individual's birthday, which can be a sign of emotional detachment rather than loneliness. the phrase ""it's my birthday and no one cares"" might initially suggest a lack of social support, but the follow-up statement ""i do not know it is just another day"" indicates a sense of resignation or acceptance rather than distress. people experiencing loneliness typically exhibit a longing for connection and validation, whereas this narrative reflects a more neutral or indifferent attitude. the absence of emotional language or a desire for social interaction further supports the idea that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness. instead, they seem to have a more pragmatic or indifferent view of their social situation, which aligns with non-loneliness indicators."
"Intimacy is a hell of a drug, why can??t I find a reliable dealer??I am generally someone who feels fairly lonely and starved of affection, I haven??t really connected emotionally to anybody in a long time and when I feel I have it always seems to fade fairly quickly or become clear that I??m much more invested in the relationship than the other person, whether it be as a friend or something more intimate. I have friends I talk to about this but I find it hard as most of my close friends have/have recently had somebody else in life they are close to and cannot fully relate to my situation, and I end up leaning on them probably a bit too much for support/advice and it can be very draining for both sides. This is a feeling I know many people experience but it doesn??t make it any less shitty, I feel like this lack of connection and intimacy (perceived in my own head or real) has scarred my soul after so long. Life can be too real sometimes and when you??re constantly trying to give your love to people and it seems to go unacknowledged it makes one feel like they aren??t really even a real person especially compared to the others that seem to have no problems becoming close to those around them. 

This may sounds like sad lonely whining but how do you guys make yourself feel better, or reassure that you??re enough when you know deep down you are yet you don??t want to believe it? Not trying to ask for sympathy just understanding and to open a conversation.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of emotional struggle and a yearning for connection and intimacy. the author describes feeling lonely and starved of affection, indicating a lack of meaningful emotional bonds. the difficulty in forming lasting connections and the perception that others are more invested in relationships are common indicators of loneliness. the author also mentions relying heavily on friends for support, which can be draining and further isolates them emotionally. the sense of being scarred by this ongoing lack of connection, and the comparison to others who seem to have no trouble forming close relationships, exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. the narrative's tone, marked by a desire for understanding rather than sympathy, highlights the author's awareness of their emotional state and their quest for reassurance and validation. these elements collectively suggest a profound experience of loneliness, characterized by a persistent sense of disconnection and emotional unfulfillment."
Nothing leftI got rat poison today mainly cause we have a rat so I put the packets out but I got extra for me. I sent out my goodbyes and nobody bothered so I'm not gonna either.

I can't take it anymore.,0,"the narrative expresses deep despair and hopelessness, with the individual feeling that their efforts and existence are meaningless. they mention sending out goodbyes and receiving no response, which suggests a lack of perceived support or concern from others. this could indicate feelings of isolation and abandonment. the use of harsh language and finality in their statements reflects intense emotional pain and frustration. however, it's possible that the context or specific circumstances surrounding the narrative may not align with chronic loneliness but rather an acute emotional crisis or other underlying issues. the narrative's focus on a specific event (obtaining rat poison) and the extreme emotional state could point to a situational rather than a prolonged sense of loneliness."
Ava? Tyler is still looking for yaHe says Timmy misses you,0,"the narrative suggests a casual and familiar tone, implying ongoing communication and connection between individuals. the mention of tyler and timmy indicates that the person has social ties and interactions, which are crucial factors in mitigating feelings of loneliness. the context appears to be one where the individual is being sought out and missed, reflecting their importance in the lives of others. this sense of being valued and having meaningful relationships generally suggests a lower likelihood of experiencing loneliness. the brevity and informal nature of the message further reinforce a sense of normalcy and social engagement."
Anyone wanna be my friend?[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a simple and direct request for friendship, which on the surface might suggest a desire for social connection. however, the brevity and straightforwardness of the message can imply that the author is casually seeking interaction rather than expressing a deeper, more pervasive sense of isolation. typical indicators of loneliness often include detailed descriptions of emotional pain, feelings of being misunderstood, or extended periods of social withdrawal. in this case, the absence of such detailed emotional context and the general tone of the message suggest that the author is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather engaging in a casual attempt to expand their social circle."
"'Fantasizing' about the futureI'm 15f. I feel so bothered and fed up with my current life situation.  I just want to grow up. Move out of my parents house, have freedom. If this is just normal teenage angst please tell me.",0,"the narrative reflects typical teenage experiences and frustrations rather than loneliness. the desire to grow up and gain independence is a common sentiment among adolescents who are navigating the transition from childhood to adulthood. the phrase ""fantasizing about the future"" suggests a normal developmental process of envisioning and planning for one's future rather than an indication of isolation or social disconnection. the expression of feeling ""bothered and fed up"" with the current life situation aligns with the natural struggle for autonomy and self-identity that many teenagers experience. the request for validation—""if this is just normal teenage angst please tell me""—indicates a search for reassurance and understanding, which is a typical behavior for someone seeking to make sense of their emotions during this life stage. there is no mention of feeling isolated, lacking social connections, or experiencing emotional distress that would typically signify loneliness. instead, the narrative focuses on the desire for personal growth and freedom, which are common developmental goals for someone in this age group."
"Dreamed about my dogI fell asleep on the couch and dreamed that my dog was there on couch sleeping with me. I woke up and remembered that my dog is dead. It felt pretty real.

I feel so alone. I live alone in a isolated area. I can't get any pets where I live either. I can't move until maybe a year.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of loss and longing for companionship, which is evident from the dream about the deceased dog and the subsequent feelings of loneliness upon waking. the individual's isolation is compounded by living alone in an isolated area and the inability to get a new pet or move for at least a year. these factors contribute to a profound sense of solitude. however, despite these elements, the narrative may not indicate a chronic or pervasive state of loneliness but rather a situational and temporary feeling of loneliness tied to specific circumstances. the dream about the dog and the feelings upon waking could be interpreted as a natural response to grief and temporary isolation rather than an enduring state of loneliness."
23F Muslim and French looking for someone to talkIf u are a tall muslim guy and kinda serious please dm me ?? I m looking desperate ik but I am tired of being lonely and failing in life.,0,"the narrative suggests a desire for companionship and connection, but the overall tone and content do not strongly indicate deep loneliness. the individual mentions looking for someone to talk to and expresses a preference for specific characteristics, which shows a proactive approach in seeking social interaction. while there is an admission of feeling desperate and tired of loneliness, the focus is on finding a specific type of person rather than expressing profound feelings of isolation or emotional distress. this suggests that the person may be experiencing situational loneliness rather than chronic or pervasive loneliness. the narrative lacks the depth of emotional pain or hopelessness that is often associated with more severe loneliness. instead, it reflects a momentary struggle and an active effort to change their circumstances."
All I want is a hug. A real hug.It??s been years since I??ve had any sort of physical contact from anyone. I wish there was an app like Tinder that??s designed specifically for non sexual touch. I think that??d be pretty neat,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for physical touch and mentions a lack of such contact for years, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the tone is somewhat hopeful and imaginative, as evidenced by the idea of an app designed for non-sexual touch. this creative thinking and the use of ""pretty neat"" indicate a level of optimism and engagement with potential solutions, which can be less typical of someone experiencing deep loneliness. the narrative lacks deeper emotional expressions of isolation or distress that are often present in individuals who feel profoundly lonely. instead, it focuses on a specific, solvable aspect of human connection."
"What can I even do?So, I am a gay male (23) and have a great husband (25). We do pretty much everything together, and it??s amazing.
The issue, though, is that I have no one outside of him. When we first moved in together, I moved to his area. As I result I left behind friends, family, and all other things I was familiar with. Whenever anything exciting is done in my life it is alongside my husband. If it isn??t just the two of us, then one of his friends is along for the ride. I like his friends, and I get the impression that they like me too, but if my husband isn??t around then we just don??t click. So really his friends aren??t really my friends if he isn??t around. Even when I try texting them to try and get to know them they just don??t make an effort to respond or click with me. 
When we aren??t doing anything, my husband texts his friends and seems to have fun. Over the years the distance has made it hard for all my old friends to stay in contact. I talk to them occasionally, but nothing ever lasts more than just a few minutes. But I can tell the distance has put a big disconnect between my old friends and me.
There have been multiple times when my husband will go out to hang out with his friends. I can tell that the intention was most likely for it to be just him and his friends, but he??s way too sweet and caring to leave me left out and always takes me along. All those times always ends up with him and his friends reminiscing and having fun while I just play on my phone in the background.
I??ve tried making new friends, but I just can??t find any way to find new friends. I??ve tried some apps and websites, but they all end up just connecting me with people whose ultimate goal is something sexual. At work I am by far the youngest person. Every single one of my coworkers has mentioned that they ??have a kid my age??. The few times I??ve attempted to have a friendship with them outside of work they have just laughed and brushed it off as if I was simply joking.

I love my husband and the life we have grown together, but I can??t even talk to him about this. I??m afraid it will either sound like I don??t like his friends, or like I don??t think he??s enough. 
I just can??t find a way to make a friend.",0,"the narrative describes a person who has a strong and fulfilling relationship with their husband, but struggles with forming connections outside of that relationship. while they express a sense of isolation from their old friends and difficulty in making new friends, the overall tone suggests a contentment and satisfaction with their primary relationship. they appreciate their husband's efforts to include them, indicating a supportive and loving partnership. the challenges they face in making new friends seem to stem more from situational factors, such as moving to a new area and age differences with coworkers, rather than an intrinsic feeling of loneliness. the narrative does not convey a deep sense of emotional distress or a pervasive feeling of loneliness, but rather a desire for broader social connections while maintaining a positive outlook on their existing relationship."
"I don't want to feel anything anymoreI'm so tired of being stressed, being a virgin, being alone. I just wanna be stuck in an endless nice dream.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of emotional exhaustion and a desire to escape from reality, which can be indicative of various psychological states. the individual mentions feeling stressed and being alone, which might initially suggest loneliness. however, the overall tone and content suggest a more complex emotional struggle rather than loneliness alone. the emphasis on wanting to escape into a dream and the frustration with being a virgin point towards feelings of inadequacy and possibly depression. the desire to avoid feelings altogether is a significant indicator of emotional distress, but not necessarily loneliness. the narrative lacks specific mentions of seeking connection or feeling isolated from others, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on a general sense of dissatisfaction and a longing for an altered state of being."
"I got rejected.She said she's ""busy"" when i tried to talk to her. Probably a sign that she's not interested in me.

That's just so mean to me. It's like a slap that making me realise that I'm an unlovable and worthless. I felt like shit now. 

Throughout my life, i never have someone to depend to, i thought i can escape my loneliness, but no. I don't belong in this world. No one is ever attracted to me. All I've ever wanted is to be loved, to have someone in my side when I'm down. 

I just feel like i want to ""end it all"". Maybe i should, since everyone wants me gone either. Plus, no one would notice it either. 

It's not her fault that I'm going to be a monster soon, i just don't want to put the blame on her. I loved her so much, and the way to end the feeling, is to do ""it""",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of rejection and self-worthlessness, with the individual describing feelings of being unloved and unwanted. phrases like ""i never have someone to depend to"" and ""i do not belong in this world"" highlight a profound sense of isolation. the individual’s contemplation of ending their life and the belief that no one would notice further indicate a severe emotional struggle. however, the focus on the specific rejection and the intense emotional response may suggest a situational rather than chronic loneliness. the emphasis on the rejection from one person and the resulting emotional turmoil may be more indicative of a temporary state of distress rather than a pervasive feeling of loneliness. the narrative also lacks references to a broader, ongoing pattern of social isolation beyond this particular incident."
"Where did people like us go wrong?Serious question. Where did people like us go wrong? It seems like there are a lot of isolated people here. I have the same problem. Most of my life I??ve been isolated while other people have had great friendships and relationships. 

But why? Where did they go right and where did I go wrong? Why did people like us end up alone? Why did people like them end up with many friendships and relationships? Where did we go wrong? By the way I??m looking for a serious answer. This isn??t just some rant or something. It??s a genuine question.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of introspection and questioning about social connections and personal experiences. the author expresses curiosity and confusion about the disparity between their own social experiences and those of others, highlighting feelings of isolation and a desire for understanding. despite this, the tone suggests a proactive approach in seeking answers and a genuine interest in resolving their social challenges. the narrative lacks overt expressions of emotional distress or hopelessness, which are often associated with loneliness. instead, it focuses on a thoughtful inquiry into the reasons behind social isolation, indicating a level of self-awareness and a desire for improvement rather than resignation. the absence of despair and the presence of a rational, solution-oriented mindset are key aspects that suggest the author is not experiencing significant loneliness, but rather a reflective and inquisitive state of mind."
Up for a chatAnything!,0,"the narrative suggests an openness and willingness to engage in conversation, which typically indicates a proactive approach to social interaction. the phrase ""up for a chat"" implies that the individual is actively seeking communication and connection with others, rather than feeling isolated or withdrawn. the addition of ""anything!"" further emphasizes their eagerness and flexibility in topics, showcasing a positive and engaging attitude. these elements suggest a sense of social availability and an absence of the hesitance or reluctance often seen in individuals experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a readiness to connect and participate in social exchanges, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"If I had the money, I'd pay someone to hang with me.Fake enthusiasm is better than nothing I guess",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for companionship, but it lacks the depth and emotional expression typically associated with profound loneliness. the mention of paying someone for company and the acceptance of fake enthusiasm indicate a pragmatic approach to social interaction rather than an emotional yearning. this pragmatic tone and the casual dismissal of authenticity suggest a functional, albeit unfulfilled, social need rather than the deep emotional pain often seen in loneliness. the individual acknowledges a preference for any interaction over isolation, but there is no indication of significant distress or longing for meaningful connections, which are key indicators of loneliness."

If you can keep your head when all about you??????

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

?????? And??which is more??you??ll be a Man, my son!",0,"the narrative reflects an admiration for a poem that emphasizes resilience, self-reliance, and maintaining composure in the face of adversity. the poem's content focuses on ideals of strength, integrity, and the ability to navigate life's challenges without being swayed by external circumstances or emotions. these themes suggest a mindset that values inner strength and self-assuredness, rather than one preoccupied with feelings of isolation or loneliness. the reference to maintaining virtue, keeping a balanced perspective, and treating triumph and disaster equally indicates a philosophical approach to life that prioritizes mental fortitude over emotional vulnerability. the narrative's appreciation for such themes suggests an alignment with these values, rather than a focus on feelings of loneliness or social disconnection."
How has chronic loneliness and isolation affected you ?How has years worth of loneliness and isolation affected your mental health and life in general ?,0,"the narrative presents a question that is introspective and seeks to understand the impact of chronic loneliness and isolation on an individual's mental health and overall life. while the questions themselves focus on loneliness, they do not necessarily indicate that the author is currently experiencing these feelings. instead, the narrative could be interpreted as an inquiry or an attempt to gather information about the effects of loneliness from others. there is no direct expression of personal feelings of loneliness, nor are there specific examples or descriptions of the author's own experiences with isolation. the absence of personal anecdotes or emotional language typical of someone suffering from loneliness suggests that the narrative is more observational or academic in nature, rather than a reflection of the author's current emotional state. this context implies that the author may not be experiencing loneliness themselves but is instead interested in understanding its effects on others."
"Does anyone get those triggers?You know, where you have to like mute/play stuff over a song about long-standing connections, or where you have to look away when two people hug during a movie?

Heck, even my own interests trigger me sometimes due to connections to bullying and being left behind...",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's sensitivity to certain triggers, such as songs about long-standing connections or scenes of people hugging in movies, which evoke emotional responses. these triggers seem to stem from past experiences of bullying and feeling left behind. while these experiences might suggest underlying emotional distress, the narrative does not explicitly convey a sense of pervasive loneliness. instead, it highlights specific moments of discomfort and sensitivity rather than an ongoing feeling of isolation or lack of social connection. the focus is more on avoiding triggers rather than expressing a deep sense of loneliness or longing for companionship."
"not sure why i'm sharing this with google forever buti'm a 30 year old man and i just realized that my mom never loved me. i was made to be a resource to exploit mainly for her. that's why i never had any energy to do anything my entire life and i always quit. that's why i'm lacking. that's why i didn't live, never had a friend, never touched a girl and got used by everyone i interacted with. i look to others to fill what i lack. love, wholeness, validation. when you're like that, people either stay away from you because there's nothing uglier than an old infant or people take advantage of you because you're a sitting duck. 

i feel rejected because i am rejected by my own mother. what kind of person isn't wanted by his own mother? she's not different than a mom who abandons her son, even whores her son. but more manipulative and deceptive. its harder to notice her damage at least it was harder to me since it took this long. damage was mental, emotional and psychological. not physical. although it had physical consequences like lack of physical maturation. i had a unloving, hateful, hostile, manipulative, malevolent, overbearing mother. no wonder i gave up hope of anything positive when i was a kid without being aware of it. my life makes a lot more sense now. now that i know the truth i wonder if i can feel maybe better or if i'll never be normal. i'll probably never be normal. i ask myself what did i do to deserve this? i must have done something wrong. 

since a year ago or so, i knew i exist as an insurance policy to her but apparently i didn't fully accept it before. i noticed i still feel hurt when she is unfair and hostile towards me. when you accept something, it shouldn't make you feel differently. so i realized i didn't accept the truth. so i paid more attention. that's how i discovered these stuff. 

i feel like my life was stolen from me. i'm grieving something but idk what i'm grieving. a mother i thought i had? or me? i'm crying right now while trying to be quiet.

i don't dare to think of what kind of life other people have with their family. it makes no sense to wish things were different. this is reality. it doesn't make sense to wish i had a bit of relief and comfort from a human. i suppose my relief source is knowing i can always die. it is what comforts me. 

it seems like i am still looking for my mom because i'm making a post here looking to fill the gap. 

is this what life is like? why is it so twisted and hardcore? its like you're going through surgery without anesthesia all the time. 

this is also embarrassing. i'm embarrassing myself. what can people give me? nothing. its like drinking salty water for my thirst.",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of betrayal and emotional pain stemming from a troubled relationship with the author's mother. the author expresses feelings of being used and unloved, which has led to a lifelong struggle with self-worth and an inability to form meaningful connections. they describe themselves as lacking energy, hope, and normalcy, with a pervasive sense of rejection and grief. despite this, the author is actively seeking understanding and clarity about their situation, indicating a level of self-awareness and a desire to process their experiences. the narrative is marked by a raw and honest exploration of their emotional state, highlighting the profound impact of their mother's behavior on their psychological well-being. the presence of such detailed introspection and the expression of a desire for relief, albeit through dark thoughts, suggests an ongoing struggle but also an attempt to make sense of their life and experiences."
"I know it??s meI started college so I could get friends. I know. I had no other drive to better myself. I have a lot of medical issues that my doctor and I still haven??t figured out... I don??t look it though. I??m very bubbly.

I??m at the point where I??m giving up. I already couldn??t make friends growing up because I moved schools every year, sometimes multiple times a year.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is facing challenges in forming and maintaining friendships, but there are several aspects that suggest they are not experiencing loneliness. the person is actively engaging with others, initiating and participating in conversations, and receiving contact information from peers. despite the frustrations and setbacks, they exhibit a proactive attitude towards social interactions and express a bubbly personality. their reflection on past experiences of moving schools frequently provides context for their current struggles, yet it does not necessarily indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, it highlights their resilience and ongoing efforts to connect with others. the narrative lacks expressions of deep emotional isolation or despair, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the individual's awareness of their situation and continuous attempts to improve their social life suggest a hopeful and determined mindset rather than one overwhelmed by loneliness."
"Sometimes I feel like what hurts me the most about my loneliness is other people??s opinion.I feel like such a piece of garbage because of how still being single in your 20s is seen as weird, abnormal and sad. Which... it is, I guess. I just wish people could mind their own business and not straight up shame people struggling with relationships. I??m judging myself enough already. I feel so ashamed.",0,"the narrative reveals an individual who is grappling with societal pressures and judgments about their relationship status. the focus is on the external opinions and the shame these bring, rather than an internal sense of isolation or lack of social connection. the person expresses frustration with how being single is perceived by others, which suggests a sensitivity to social norms rather than a deep-seated loneliness. their self-criticism and desire for others to mind their own business highlight a struggle with self-esteem and societal expectations, but not necessarily an absence of meaningful relationships or a profound feeling of loneliness. these elements point towards a person who is more affected by external judgment than by a lack of social interaction or companionship."

Batteries not included.",0,"the narrative contains multiple indicators that suggest a struggle with mental health, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. however, despite these indicators, the tone of the narrative is characterized by a sense of humor and sarcasm, which can sometimes be a coping mechanism for dealing with difficult emotions. the mention of being ""super submissive"" and the emphasis on negative self-descriptions like ""complete virgin loser"" and ""never goes outside"" might suggest a low self-esteem, but these statements are delivered in a way that seems to mock the situation rather than express genuine despair. the exaggerated sales pitch format, offering herself as a ""deal"" and mentioning ""batteries not included,"" further indicates a layer of detachment or irony rather than a straightforward expression of loneliness. overall, while the narrative includes elements that could be associated with loneliness, the manner in which they are presented leans more towards a satirical or self-deprecating humor, which may suggest a different emotional state or coping strategy."
"""It's not your fault""I was told to write something to myself. A letter of forgiveness. ""It's not your fault. You have abandonment &amp; attachment issue related to abuse and loss. They can't be fixed at this point, so you'll just have to be alone. It's not your fault, but no one can love you.""",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-awareness and acceptance of personal issues related to abandonment and attachment stemming from past abuse and loss. while it acknowledges the existence of these emotional struggles, the tone is more resigned and accepting rather than indicative of acute loneliness. the writer seems to be engaging in a therapeutic exercise, suggesting a level of self-compassion and understanding. the statement ""it's not your fault"" and the repetition of this reassurance indicate an attempt to alleviate self-blame rather than express a current feeling of loneliness. the mention of being alone is framed as a consequence of unchangeable circumstances rather than an active, painful experience of loneliness. this acceptance and the context of writing a letter of forgiveness to oneself imply a process of healing and self-care, which are not typically aligned with the acute emotional distress characteristic of loneliness."
"Feel so lostSeems like the last couple of years I just can't catch a break. Having some medical issues and lost my job because I couldn't ever get them resolved.  To have the surgeries required I was told I needed to pay half in advance.  I asked how am I to do that when I lost my job?  The doctor actually shrugged and said sorry for your luck. My wife seems to be pulling away from me...I know she's been patient and knows how much pain I'm in daily, but it's starting to take it's toll on her. She now sleeps in one room and me in another. We don't do anything together anymore.  She's my best friend and I feel like I've lost her. Now I'm sitting here with my gun next to me thinking I should do what is right and stop being a burden to my family.  I don't know I'm lost, confused, I don't know what to do....",0,"the narrative depicts a profound sense of despair and confusion, marked by significant life challenges such as medical issues, job loss, and marital strain. the individual describes feeling lost and burdened, struggling to find solutions to their problems, and experiencing a disconnection from their spouse, who is described as their best friend. the physical separation within their home and the cessation of shared activities are poignant indicators of the emotional distance that has developed. additionally, the mention of contemplating drastic actions underscores the depth of their distress. while these elements reflect a high degree of emotional turmoil and a perceived sense of being a burden, the narrative's focus on these specific personal crises and the detailed account of the individual's internal state and external circumstances are crucial in understanding their psychological and emotional landscape."
"how does one stop missing their s/o too muchokay so basically for the past few days ive been feeling hella off. like ive been crying every night because of this empty void in me. like no matter what i do I can't seem to fill it.

thanks have a great day/night &lt;3",0,"the narrative describes feelings of missing a significant other and experiencing an emotional void. however, the expression of these feelings appears situational and tied specifically to the absence of the partner, rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the writer seeks advice on coping mechanisms while waiting for a response from their partner, indicating an expectation of connection and communication that suggests an underlying support system. the casual tone, use of internet slang, and the signing off with a positive note (""thanks have a great day/night <3"") imply a level of social engagement and optimism. these elements point to a temporary emotional state rather than chronic loneliness."
"WE ARE ALL LONELY &amp; it??s Beautiful!Are used to be extremely lonely almost to the point where I thought that I was living in a world of robots and I was the only one who is sane or normal.

But that was over five years ago. I??m 24 now and I still struggle sometimes with feeling lonely but one thing I??ve come to understand is that through meditation and prayer I realize that being lonely is in a horrible thing it??s a blessing. When you??re alone you get to understand who you really are inside and get to love that person and I??ll tell you love that person you??re never going to truly be free from this loneliness.

So I challenge you to be alone with yourself and learn to love yourself! Don??t give into what everybody else is saying or thinking or doing because guess what... you??re above average! You have something special in you and I know it sounds clich?? or like some bullshit that everybody else says but it??s actually true you were born for a reason do universe doesn??t just make mistakes on random people being born. No matter what disability you have or insecurities you??re impacting somebody somewhere and that??s a beautiful think.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT

1. Meditation is key for anyone who is feeling lonely the reason is because you build the gray matter in your brain that strengthens happiness and dopamine to the correct levels

2. You need to take long walks in nature, alone! There are living things all around us appreciate them and appreciate that you are a live along side them. 

3. Defeat fear by being grateful in the moment! It is almost impossible to be fearful of your loneliness if you are grateful for the things you do half the fact that you can see , the fact that you can hear the,fact that you can smell, the fact that you??re able to read this are all amazing grateful blessings that should not go on noticed!

4. Demand a higher standard of yourself and make a plan to attain that higher standard. Whether your skin is colored green, you have one eye, you have no legs, and or you were insecure about your social skills none of it matters. There are 7 billion people on this planet that I feel lonely and you deserve to be around them the first you must love who you are. And the best way to start loving yourself is to demand more of yourself and love the process of getting there!

5. My favorite way to defeat loneliness is helping others even if you feel lonely get out into the world and enjoy helping. Gandhi one said ?? We find ourselves when we lose ourselves in the happiness of others?? 

6. Write in a journal every morning before you do anything after you wake up. Write down your emotions, fears, exciting news, and end with a positive affirmation. DO IT EVERYDAY! It takes 2 mins

7. To anyone who is lonely know that you are not alone they??re amazing things looking after you and within yourself that loneliness is powerful embrace it and start loving who you are when you??re with your thoughts.

Like anything, what you practice grows! So, practice this again and again until it becomes an adaptation response and live stronger, happier, healthier and with a purpose! 

GOD BLESS MY LONELY SQUAD ???????",0,"the narrative reflects a journey from a deep sense of loneliness to a state of acceptance and empowerment. initially, the author describes a period of extreme loneliness, feeling isolated and different from others. however, over time, they have developed strategies to cope with and even embrace their solitude. they highlight the importance of meditation, nature walks, gratitude, self-improvement, helping others, and journaling as tools to combat loneliness. the narrative is filled with positive affirmations and encouragement for others to find strength and beauty in their solitude. the tone is optimistic and focused on personal growth, suggesting that the author has found a way to turn their loneliness into a source of strength and self-love. this shift in perspective and proactive approach to dealing with loneliness indicates that the author is not currently overwhelmed by loneliness but rather has found a constructive way to manage and appreciate their alone time."
"Is a loneliness panic attack a thing? Bc I think I??m having one.I can??t even begin to describe what I feel anymore. I??m hopeless. I just want to find someone, but every time I try I get nothing. No responses, no likes, no matches. Just nothing. And when I look for advice I start comparing my sad excuse for myself to all the other more attractive guys on the same sites I use. 

I don??t believe I??ve felt so out of hope. I just see myself as pathetic, and even more pathetic that I??m posting this rant here. Bc I don??t know what I??m expecting anymore. 

Even when I get a surge of confidence for a month or so, I get blasted by the realization that it doesn??t matter how confident, good looking, social, or anything I am. Nothing will work.

I just want love. That??s all.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and hopelessness related to the search for companionship. the individual describes experiencing feelings of inadequacy and self-comparison to others, which are common in people struggling with self-esteem issues. the recurring mention of unsuccessful attempts to connect with others and the resulting emotional turmoil highlight a cycle of hope and disappointment. despite the apparent desperation and negative self-perception, the focus on external validation and the search for love suggest a significant preoccupation with social acceptance and personal worth. the narrative does not exhibit the isolation or withdrawal typical of loneliness, but rather an active, albeit painful, engagement in social pursuits. the expression of emotions and the act of seeking advice indicate a desire for connection and support, rather than the pervasive sense of disconnection associated with loneliness."
"it always ends the same way, why not meI (19M) have had countless people tell me how good of a guy I am and anyone would be lucky to be with me. But no matter what I do any girl I've ever talked to has ended with me in my own bed alone overthinking about what I did wrong or what others did better. 
I started working out again in September, I hadn't since highschool and I'm seeing the results of the work I've been putting in at the gym, people always say I'm funny or polite and that I'm decent looking.

Everything I've thought about what I'm doing wrong I try and fix or work on it but I feel like it's all a waste because nothing has worked
I don't have a hard time finding girls I vibe with well, but its keeping them around and wanting to hang out with me I always screw up and I don't know what I do wrong, but it has to be something wrong with me with how many times its happened. I think I handle the rejection the way I should and I don't think I'm too forward or not confident enough, but it's been getting harder and harder each time to the point where now I'm convinced I'm gonna die alone and a virgin.",0,"the narrative presents an individual who is grappling with repeated romantic rejections and feelings of inadequacy. despite receiving positive feedback about his personality and appearance, he struggles to understand why his interactions with potential partners do not lead to lasting relationships. while he expresses frustration and self-doubt, he also shows a proactive approach by trying to improve himself through working out and reflecting on his behavior. the key indicators here suggest that although he experiences disappointment and self-reflection, he does not exhibit the deeper sense of pervasive loneliness. his active social interactions, self-improvement efforts, and rational handling of rejection indicate a resilience and a connection to others that mitigate the sense of profound loneliness. his narrative reflects situational distress rather than a chronic state of loneliness."

I just really need someone to tell me whether i was at fault",0,"the narrative suggests a person seeking clarity and validation after a breakup, reflecting on their behavior and the relationship dynamics. although the individual describes feelings of depression and loneliness during their partner's absence, the focus is primarily on understanding the reasons behind the breakup rather than expressing ongoing loneliness. the mention of spamming messages indicates a reaction to temporary feelings of isolation, but the overall tone is one of self-reflection and a desire for feedback rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. this indicates that while the person experienced situational loneliness, it does not dominate their narrative."
I've been divorced for 5 years from what I thought was the love of my life. I'm not doing well.nan,0,"the narrative indicates that the individual has been divorced for five years and expresses a sense of not doing well. while the mention of divorce and the feeling of not doing well might initially suggest potential loneliness, there are no explicit statements or descriptions that clearly indicate feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a desire for companionship. instead, the focus is more on the personal struggle and emotional distress related to the divorce itself. this could suggest that the individual might be experiencing other emotional difficulties such as sadness, grief, or depression rather than loneliness. the absence of references to social disconnection or a lack of meaningful relationships supports the classification that this narrative is not primarily about loneliness."
"This video cheers me up - I??m lonely.Here??s a song I listen to when I need to get out of a sad spell or cry. It??s just silly. I hope it makes you smile. I??m in a bummed out mood and just wanted to share a goofy song. Lonely little humans unite!

https://youtu.be/Ep9Vzb6R_58",0,"the narrative showcases an individual attempting to uplift their mood through humor and music, which are positive coping mechanisms. despite mentioning feeling ""bummed out,"" the tone suggests a temporary state rather than chronic loneliness. the use of ""lonely little humans unite!"" indicates a playful approach to connecting with others, rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. the act of sharing a song to make others smile points to an outward focus and a desire to engage socially, which are not typical indicators of profound loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects someone experiencing a passing mood rather than enduring loneliness."
there??s nothing i love more than being ghosted by a person i actually thought i had a connection with :)))nan,0,"the narrative presents a sarcastic tone, suggesting frustration and disappointment rather than loneliness. the use of sarcasm in ""there's nothing i love more"" and the exaggerated smiley face at the end indicate the author is expressing annoyance or irritation with the situation. while being ghosted can be a painful experience, the narrative does not delve into feelings of isolation or a deeper sense of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the specific event of being ghosted and the emotional reaction to it. the lack of explicit mention of loneliness or feelings of being alone supports the classification. the narrative's focus on a single incident rather than a pervasive sense of disconnection from others is a key indicator that it does not reflect a state of loneliness."
Why...?How?,0,"the narrative consists of brief, open-ended questions that lack context or detail. these questions, while potentially reflective of curiosity or confusion, do not provide enough information to suggest feelings of loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might express emotions such as sadness, isolation, or a longing for connection. they might describe specific situations where they feel left out or express a desire for companionship. in contrast, the narrative here is too vague and does not contain any indicators of such emotional states. therefore, it is more likely that the questions are stemming from a general inquiry or a momentary sense of wonder rather than a deeper emotional struggle related to loneliness."
Started doing what i wantedIm afraid i might hurt someone do to my repressed anger and view of the world but hey at least im feeling better.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is undergoing a personal transformation and starting to prioritize their own desires and needs. despite acknowledging the presence of repressed anger and a potentially negative view of the world, the person notes an improvement in their overall emotional state. this indicates a level of self-awareness and proactive steps towards self-care, which are generally positive signs. the expression of fear about hurting others suggests a concern for the well-being of those around them, which implies they are not socially isolated. their mention of feeling better overall points to a sense of personal growth and emotional progress, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these aspects suggest the individual is engaged in self-improvement and has a degree of social consciousness that often accompanies connections with others."
I keep having great dreams of being happy.Every night. I have these amazing dreams where I'm happy and I'm with someone. Then I wake up and im alone. I no longer like sleeping,0,"the narrative describes a person who experiences vivid dreams of happiness and companionship, which starkly contrasts with their waking reality. despite this contrast, the individual doesn't show signs of deep-seated loneliness. instead, they express a dissatisfaction with sleep due to the disparity between their dreams and reality. this dissatisfaction might stem from a desire for more fulfilling real-life experiences rather than an underlying loneliness. the dreams themselves are not indicative of loneliness; they are more about an idealized state of happiness. the person's ability to have such positive dreams suggests they have a hopeful outlook and a capacity for joy, even if it's currently not being fully realized in their waking life."
"I got GhostedI finally got andaye with a girl. We met on tinder I know its cringe but I have no friends that can introduce me to people. I thought we had really hit it off and we sat in a bar for like 6 hours just talking. Then the next day I saw that she blocked me. Fuck dude that hurts, I'm mature enough to handle rejection but just getting blocked hits different. 
And before yall ask no she didn't want free food she insisted on splitting thr bill.

Ghosting sucks.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who recently experienced being ghosted after a seemingly successful date. while the individual expresses hurt and frustration over the sudden end of communication, there are several indicators that suggest they are not experiencing loneliness. first, the person mentions meeting someone through tinder and having a long conversation, indicating social engagement and the ability to form connections. despite the negative outcome, the fact that they were able to secure a date and engage in meaningful interaction shows they are not entirely isolated. additionally, the individual acknowledges their maturity in handling rejection, which suggests a level of emotional resilience. the expression of frustration over ghosting is a common response and does not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a specific incident of social disappointment rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
"What's something you're grateful for?I'm grateful that I found this community and interacted with a lot of really awesome people.

What about you?  Please keep this as positive as possible.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of gratitude and positive social interaction, which are indicators of a well-connected and content individual. the person expresses appreciation for being part of a community and highlights the joy of meeting ""really awesome people,"" suggesting they have meaningful social connections. their request to keep the conversation positive further implies a proactive approach to maintaining a healthy and supportive environment. such expressions typically denote a person who feels supported and valued within their social network, counteracting feelings of loneliness. the focus on positive interactions and community involvement aligns with psychological insights that emphasize the importance of social support in mitigating loneliness."
"bad dayI moved to a new city a few months ago. I was hoping for a fresh start, but I seem to have forgotten that I??m simply the same person in a new place. I??ve always had issues keeping friends because each time I meet someone, I??m constantly anxious and worried they hate me. I??ve met a few people here, and it??s the same thing. I feel dumb because I??m in a big city with tons of people, but I??ve never been more alone.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who has recently moved to a new city and is struggling with social anxiety and self-doubt. despite the challenges mentioned, such as difficulty keeping friends and constant worry about being disliked, the narrative does not strongly indicate deep loneliness. instead, it reflects a common experience of adjustment and social anxiety that many people face when transitioning to a new environment. the writer acknowledges meeting a few people, which suggests some level of social interaction and potential for building connections. the expression of feeling ""dumb"" and ""alone"" in a big city can be seen as frustration with the adjustment process rather than an inherent sense of isolation. overall, the narrative points more towards situational anxiety and the normal difficulties of adapting to a new place rather than chronic loneliness."
"I disgust myselfI disgust myself. Everybody else says ""don't worry, I am here"" to their girlfriends or boyfriends and im sitting all alone and I try to make myself feel comforted by ""I wish I was there"" of someone that just wishes she was here so id fuck her. And I dare wish for something more too. I'm such a sad and ungrateful motherfucker",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-loathing and frustration with personal circumstances, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. the individual expresses disgust towards themselves and perceives their situation as inferior compared to others who have supportive partners. while these feelings can be intense and distressing, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the narrative suggests a preoccupation with self-worth and comparison to others, which are common issues related to self-esteem rather than social isolation. the mention of someone wishing to be with them, albeit for physical reasons, indicates some level of social interaction and potential connections, even if they are not fulfilling the individual's emotional needs. thus, the focus on self-hatred and comparison, rather than a lack of social bonds or feelings of isolation, aligns with the classification."
Law of lonelyI am trying to understand why the world has a law of lonely and unlonely. Sometimes it seems to me like we the lonely feel the heaviest emotions.,0,"the narrative reflects a contemplative perspective on the concept of loneliness, indicating a philosophical inquiry rather than personal suffering. the author speaks about ""the law of lonely and unlonely"" in a detached, almost analytical manner, suggesting an interest in understanding loneliness from an external viewpoint. the phrase ""we the lonely feel the heaviest emotions"" implies a general observation rather than a personal declaration of loneliness. this detached tone and the focus on understanding rather than expressing personal pain are typical indicators of non-loneliness. the narrative lacks the personal anecdotes, emotional depth, and expressions of isolation that are often present in narratives written by individuals experiencing loneliness."
"Finding peace.Suffering from love can be hard. Being lonely is hard. You have your own mind. You have yourself. The only one who truly understands your feelings is you. Comfort yourself. You are never alone. We are a lot of people in the same place. We love ourselves because we know that if we are not enough for someone, we will always be enough for ourselves. Working on our personality can be hard. Working on our body can be even harder. There is time. Take it easy. You are not alone.",0,"the narrative speaks to the challenges of suffering from love and the difficulty of loneliness, but it also emphasizes self-reliance and self-comfort. it highlights the importance of understanding one's own feelings and the reassurance that comes from self-acceptance. the repeated assertion that ""you are not alone"" and ""we are a lot of people in the same place"" suggests a sense of community and shared experience, which can mitigate feelings of loneliness. the focus on self-improvement and the encouragement to take things easy further indicate a positive, proactive mindset. these aspects suggest that the individual is not overwhelmed by loneliness but is instead finding strength and peace within themselves and their community."
"I just wish I could get a girl.So i live in a frat house with 5 other people. i'm currently a senior but will be graduating late, which is whatever that doesn't really bother me. What bothers me is that it seems like everyone can get with a girl but me. I've had sex only once, but that's because i got very lucky, and i've never been in a relationship. I can't help but compare myself to other people. I just don't understand what's going on with me, i'm a bit above average looking so it's not like i'm too ugly enough to put girls off. I just feel like i'm a loser who watches vtubers (this does make me a bit happy honestly, it's a somewhat healthy coping mechanism) who constantly thinks about cutting myself (unhealthy coping mechanism).

Ik I got some good friends, and that I'm thankful for. But it also sucks that once I graduate and I go back to my parent's place to live for.a bit, i will literally have no friends to be with in my hometown cause i burned all my bridges from high school by accident.",0,"the narrative describes a person who, despite expressing dissatisfaction with their romantic life and occasional feelings of inadequacy, demonstrates a level of self-awareness and coping mechanisms that suggest resilience rather than profound loneliness. the individual acknowledges having good friends and expresses gratitude for them, which indicates a support system. their concerns about moving back home and having no friends there are tied to past mistakes rather than a current pervasive sense of isolation. the mention of healthy coping mechanisms, like watching vtubers, alongside the recognition of unhealthy thoughts, shows an ability to differentiate and manage emotions. this combination of social connections, self-awareness, and gratitude suggests that while the person experiences challenges and negative emotions, they are not overwhelmed by loneliness."
"They talk about you behind your backI was walking to class and I noticed someone I knew in the hallway. I was going to say hey to him, but he was talking to one of his friends. I heard them talking about how I??m annoying and say cringy shit all the time. I always had a feeling people talked shit about me behind my back, but to actually see it was pretty fucked up.",0,"the narrative describes an experience of overhearing negative comments made by peers, which is understandably upsetting. however, it doesn't necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual seems to have social interactions, as they recognize someone in the hallway and consider greeting them. the distress comes from the content of the overheard conversation, which relates more to concerns about social acceptance and self-perception rather than isolation. while the experience may contribute to feelings of social anxiety or self-doubt, it does not inherently suggest a lack of social connections or support. thus, the narrative reflects an incident of social conflict rather than a broader pattern of loneliness."
I think I??m gonna attempt suicide in the next week or so.Thanks to this sub for all the people who talked to me and made me feel better temporarily,0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of distress and contemplation of suicide, but it also mentions gratitude towards a community that provided temporary relief. while the severity of the emotional state is evident, the acknowledgment of positive interactions and the temporary comfort derived from them suggest a complex emotional landscape. the presence of these supportive interactions and the individual's ability to feel better, even if momentarily, might indicate that the underlying issue is not chronic loneliness. instead, the narrative points to an acute crisis situation where external support has had a positive, albeit short-lived, impact. this context implies that the person's struggles may be more related to an immediate emotional or psychological crisis rather than persistent loneliness."
"Why is autism such a turn off for people?I??m 17 years old. Been lonely all my life, never had a gf. I??m already unattractive, but to make matters worse, I??m also autistic. It feels like people don??t want me simply because I??m autistic.

Like what do you want me to do about it? I didn??t decide to have autism. Why do people have dating standards for traits that you can??t even control?",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of frustration and confusion about social rejection and dating standards. the individual expresses feelings of unattractiveness and attributes their loneliness to their autism, which they perceive as a significant barrier to forming relationships. while they mention being lonely and never having had a girlfriend, the tone suggests a focus on societal attitudes towards autism rather than an intrinsic feeling of loneliness. the narrative emphasizes external factors and societal judgments, which can be indicative of broader social challenges rather than an internalized sense of isolation. their questioning of why people have dating standards for uncontrollable traits indicates a critical perspective on societal norms, rather than a personal struggle with loneliness."
"If im not meIm thinking about that if i can be the opposite of me for one day, certaintly i will be happier ad whit a lot of friends, but all of my qualty  will be very bad, so its right try to be the ""beautifull face ""  of you or simply be ourselfs",0,"the narrative reflects a contemplation on self-identity and the idea of changing oneself to fit societal expectations. the author ponders whether adopting a different persona would lead to increased happiness and more friendships, but also acknowledges that such a change might compromise their inherent qualities. this internal debate suggests a level of self-awareness and acceptance, as the author ultimately questions the value of altering one's true self. the narrative does not exhibit classic indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of sadness and emptiness. instead, it demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of personal authenticity versus social conformity, which implies a certain level of contentment with their current state."
"I'm desperately upvoting every single post and commentBecause I'm afraid that someone will feel even more lonely here. It might be stupid, but I know the feeling. You have no one and the only place where you might feel comfortable no one notices you. No one should ever feel alone.",0,"the narrative describes a person who is empathetic and concerned about others' feelings of loneliness, but it does not indicate that the author themselves is experiencing loneliness. the author is actively engaging with the community by upvoting posts and comments to ensure that others feel acknowledged and less isolated. this proactive behavior suggests a sense of connection and purpose rather than loneliness. the author also mentions understanding the feeling of loneliness, which shows empathy, but their focus is on preventing others from feeling alone rather than expressing their own loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects compassion and active involvement rather than personal isolation."
"hello everyone!! we are so excited to have just opened our new 60s/diner themed chat on discord, its 18+ and we would love to meet some people and make some lovely friends in there! please join and come say hi, we promise we are nice and will make you feel welcome! hope you are havin a groovy week:D[https://discord.gg/4B8fEr8S](https://discord.gg/4B8fEr8S)",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of enthusiasm and community, which are typically indicators of social engagement rather than loneliness. the author expresses excitement about opening a new chat and actively invites others to join, highlighting a proactive approach to social interaction. the use of cheerful language and exclamations, such as ""we are so excited"" and ""hope you are havin a groovy week,"" suggests a positive and outgoing attitude. the promise to make new members feel welcome and the friendly tone indicate an inclusive and supportive environment, further reinforcing the idea that the author is not experiencing loneliness. these elements collectively point to someone who is socially connected and eager to build and maintain relationships."
"How can you meet people that are ACTUALLY similar to you?Why isn't there some global website where you can list exact interests like your 10 favourite movies and be matched with other people who also enjoy those same things etc? Matching with people based on ""interest"" is too broad imo. It would be better to meet people based on the personality traits (for example i'm high in openness) 

It feels like everyone is friends on the basis of where they go to school/uni or where they grew up as opposed to who they really are. I just know there's people out there who are like me but I don't know how to find them...",0,"the narrative expresses a desire for deeper and more meaningful connections based on specific interests and personality traits rather than superficial commonalities such as school or upbringing. while the individual is questioning the current methods of forming friendships and seeking more precise ways to connect with like-minded people, there is no indication of emotional distress or feelings of isolation. instead, the focus is on the practical aspects of social matching and a proactive approach to improving social interactions. the tone suggests curiosity and a thoughtful consideration of how to enhance the quality of relationships rather than an expression of loneliness."
Is anyone available to talk?Dropped my daughter off at nursery 2 hours ago and done nothing but cry since. Please does anyone wanna talk,0,"the narrative reflects a moment of acute emotional distress rather than chronic loneliness. the individual expresses a need for immediate support and connection after a significant emotional event—dropping off their daughter at nursery. this situation can evoke strong feelings of separation anxiety and temporary sadness, which are common and not necessarily indicative of long-term loneliness. the plea for someone to talk to is a natural response to seeking comfort and reassurance during a difficult moment. these expressions are situational and tied to a specific incident, rather than indicating a pervasive sense of isolation or lack of social connections that characterize chronic loneliness."
"Honestly speaking, i??m scared.I??m 20, a virgin, haven??t even kissed anyone ever, and have a few friends. I??m not in shape, i have a problematic health and depression. 

This makes me so scared to think that with all of this, I want to live out a dream. I want to live with a wife and kids, do things i love and make money. 

But i don??t know if i can even get someone to share my love with, to receive intimacy from. Even if i find someone, am i enough? i have so many problems to deal with myself, how will i take care of them? 

What if i don??t find someone? I??m lost, and scared of dying alone.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of fear and uncertainty about the future, particularly regarding relationships and personal fulfillment. the individual expresses concerns about their physical health, depression, and lack of romantic experience, which contribute to their anxiety about achieving their dreams of having a family and a fulfilling life. despite these worries, the person still holds onto their aspirations and shows a desire to overcome their challenges. this hope and the presence of a few friends suggest that they have some level of social support and a forward-looking mindset. while they are scared and feel lost, their narrative does not necessarily indicate a profound sense of isolation or disconnection from others, which are key indicators of loneliness. instead, their fears seem to stem more from self-doubt and health issues rather than a lack of social bonds."
"Spending thanksgiving with parentsWasn??t sure which sub to put this in, so please let me know if there??s a better one. 

Some context: 
Parents and I aren??t close. My mother is highly anxious (and definitely the source of my anxiety). Dad is pretty quiet, which I prefer. I think he knows I don??t want to share or I inherited the same familial silence. Either way, he??s often telling me he??ll ??talk to her?? about the things she says and does. To keep it short, she??s really overbearing. I??m almost 30 and when I come home (I live 1000 miles away permanently, been doing so for 10 years) she doesn??t allow me to do anything on my own. 

At first it sounds nice, someone to cook and clean for you. She takes it too far, whenever I??m making myself food she??s hovering making sure I??m doing everything ??right??. She doesn??t allow me to use the stove (any time I try she rushes over and turns it off). I??m an only child and there??s a reason I live 1000 mile away, and I limit my visits home to twice a year. Since I??m the only child, I have to take care of them. 

The meat of it: 

I was supposed to spend thanksgiving with my bf and his family. I did last year when I couldn??t travel, and I get along with them so much better. My parents last minute asked me to come for two weeks. When I say I can??t my mom cries and then I??m the villain. 

I??m really sad I can??t be with my bf and his family today, and I feel like I??m annoying all my friends I??m texting today. I just feel lonely and sad and I don??t know what to do with myself for the rest of the day. 

I guess - how are you all? Tell me about your day or something you??re excited to do?

Thanks anyone who read through that, lol.",0,"the narrative describes a complex family dynamic, where the author feels controlled and stifled by their mother's overbearing nature and prefers the quiet demeanor of their father. despite living far away and limiting visits, the author still feels obligated to take care of their parents, indicating a sense of duty rather than loneliness. the author expresses sadness and frustration about missing thanksgiving with their boyfriend and his family, who they feel more comfortable with, but this is more about situational disappointment than chronic loneliness. the author's engagement with friends through texting and their invitation for others to share their day suggests a desire for social interaction and connection, which counters the notion of pervasive loneliness. the narrative reflects a situational struggle and familial obligation rather than a deeper, enduring sense of loneliness."
"the dating game is over for me and doomed





it??s over for me. i will never be one of them dudes who have multiple girls to talk to, or have girls that want to link up with them. i will never be one of those dudes.  its such a shame my phone so dry and get no messages. 

this shit is sad asf and embarrassing. last time i been in a relationship was in 7th-8th grade. i don??t even count that because i was a kid. I??m still a virgin which is a shame. its like I??m cursed. 

i almost lost my virginity but ofc its always something. i only get kissed and hugs thats it. while others getting sex easily. most these girls be having a man,stuck up on ex, talking to someone. i guess i got to accept being single forever and being a virgin.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of frustration and self-deprecation regarding the individual's romantic and social life. they describe a lack of romantic experiences and an inability to attract partners, which they find embarrassing and sad. however, despite these negative feelings, the narrative does not delve into the deeper emotional and psychological aspects typically associated with profound loneliness. instead, it focuses more on external circumstances and comparisons with others. the individual's concern seems centered around social and sexual milestones rather than an overarching sense of isolation or disconnection from others. their language indicates disappointment and resignation, but it lacks the more intense emotional depth that often accompanies narratives of loneliness. the frustration appears to stem from unmet societal expectations and personal goals rather than a pervasive feeling of being alone or misunderstood."
"I have a boyfriend and still feel incredibly lonelyI??m starting to realise that, while I love my boyfriend very much, he??s a bandaid for my loneliness and when he??s gone, all that emptiness and sadness comes back. I??m almost even sadder these days when I am lonely for some reason. The loneliness never bothered me when I was single, but I guess now that I have him, going back to that state is so much more unbearable.

He recently invited me on a trip but I wasn??t allowed to go (I??m 19F in a strict household) and it??s made me realise that being lonely makes missing out on social events feel so much worse.

This isn??t the first time its happened. I was overseas in December when he invited me on a roadtrip with his friend and I??m still devastated I missed out on that.

It??s just really upsetting when you already don??t go out or do anything, and then missing out on chances to actually go out/do stuff on top of that.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing feelings of loneliness despite being in a relationship. this suggests that their loneliness is not necessarily due to a lack of companionship but rather an internal emotional state. the mention of feeling even sadder when lonely and the unbearable thought of returning to a state of loneliness after having a partner indicates a deeper emotional struggle. the strict household and missed opportunities for social events exacerbate these feelings, making the individual feel isolated. however, the narrative also highlights a recognition of the boyfriend as a temporary relief rather than a solution to the underlying loneliness, suggesting an awareness and insight into their emotional state. these elements are typical indicators of someone grappling with loneliness, as they reveal a complex interplay between external circumstances and internal emotional experiences."
Anyone else on the verge of tears all day?Legit been hit by the big D train - just happens to be a really long train and isn't gonna stop running me over any time soon,0,"the narrative describes an individual who is experiencing a significant amount of emotional distress, likely due to depression as indicated by the phrase ""hit by the big d train."" however, the absence of direct references to feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections suggests that loneliness may not be the primary issue. the person's focus is more on their emotional state rather than on a lack of companionship or support. this indicates that while they are struggling, their distress might stem from internal emotional challenges rather than from a sense of loneliness. the metaphor of a ""long train"" implies a prolonged period of difficulty, but it does not necessarily point to social isolation, which is a key component of loneliness."
I just want someone to be just as obsessed with me as I am of them.nan,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for mutual affection and obsession, which is a common human longing for reciprocated love and attention. the focus is on the intensity of feelings rather than on the absence of social connections or a sense of isolation. this suggests that the individual is more concerned with the depth of a specific relationship rather than experiencing a broader sense of loneliness. the language used does not indicate a lack of social interaction or emotional support, but rather a yearning for a particular type of intense, reciprocal relationship. this indicates that the individual likely has social connections but is seeking a deeper emotional connection within them."
"Am I weird?!?!To start off I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I used to be extremely social and outgoing always dating. But i was in an abusive relationship for about a year and half, got out of it 2 years ago. The past 2 years I have become a recluse. I don't hardly leave my house, only for work, when I am at home I spend alot of time reading or online reading dumb stuff. I dont have any friends, wish I was lying about this, instead when i need attention I tend to go haywire and constantly post on Facebook. It's been 2 years of loneliness...I like it at times but feel its unheatlhy. I dont have the urge to go anywhere anymore to meet people...yet I want friends lol",0,"the narrative describes a person who has experienced significant changes in their social behavior following an abusive relationship. despite these changes, they express an awareness of their situation and engage in activities like reading and spending time online. they mention a desire for attention, which they seek through social media, and acknowledge feelings of loneliness but also find some comfort in their solitude. their reflection on the unhealthy aspects of their reclusiveness and the contradiction of wanting friends but not having the urge to meet new people suggest a complex emotional state rather than a clear-cut case of loneliness. these nuances indicate an individual who is grappling with their circumstances but is not necessarily overwhelmed by loneliness."
26M need a female friend to talkJust wanted someone for a casual talk,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for casual conversation with a female friend, which in itself is not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the phrasing ""just wanted someone for a casual talk"" suggests a simple, perhaps momentary wish for social interaction rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of isolation or emotional distress. the absence of language indicating feelings of sadness, emptiness, or desperation further supports the idea that this individual's request is more about seeking light, social engagement rather than addressing a profound sense of loneliness. wanting to connect with others in a casual manner is a normal part of social behavior and does not inherently point to loneliness."
App to Tackle Loneliness[removed],0,"the narrative discusses the development of an app designed to tackle loneliness, which suggests a proactive approach to addressing social isolation. the focus is on creating a solution for others rather than expressing personal feelings of loneliness. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness often share personal anecdotes, emotions, or a sense of longing for connection. in contrast, this narrative centers on a practical, outward-facing project aimed at helping a broader audience. the absence of personal emotional content and the emphasis on problem-solving and innovation are indicators that the author may not be experiencing loneliness themselves. instead, they are likely motivated by empathy or a desire to contribute positively to society. this outward orientation and lack of introspective, emotional language are key aspects that suggest the author is not lonely."
"Msg if u want someone to talk toMsg if u want someone to talk to
Guy here btw....all r welcome!",0,"the narrative suggests a person who is open to social interaction and actively reaching out to others, which can be indicative of a willingness to connect and engage with people. the phrase ""msg if u want someone to talk to"" shows an invitation for communication and indicates that the person is not isolated but rather seeking companionship. the casual tone and inclusivity of ""all r welcome!"" further emphasize a positive and approachable attitude, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. these elements suggest that the individual is comfortable with socializing and does not exhibit signs of feeling isolated or disconnected from others."
Any criminals here? (Not asking for any particular reason)People who have a career as a criminal or those who don't value common notions or societal values in general can't be open to many people. Are any of you there? (Not asking for any particular reason) Pm me.,0,"the narrative reflects a curiosity about the presence of criminals rather than expressing feelings of isolation or loneliness. the author seems to be probing for individuals who deviate from societal norms and values, which suggests an interest in understanding or engaging with unconventional perspectives. there is no mention of personal feelings of solitude, a lack of social connections, or emotional distress, which are common indicators of loneliness. the request for private messages appears to be driven by curiosity or a desire for unique interactions rather than a need for companionship or social support. this focus on external subjects and the absence of introspective commentary on personal emotional states indicates that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
19F[removed],0,"the narrative likely reflects a person who has a supportive social network and engages in meaningful interactions. they might describe activities that involve friends or family, and express feelings of contentment and fulfillment. they could also mention participating in group activities or hobbies that involve socializing. such descriptions suggest a well-rounded social life, which is a strong indicator of not experiencing loneliness. the presence of positive emotions and a sense of belonging in their daily life further reinforces this assessment."
Hard ain??t that hard if you don??t know easySeeing other people so happy to have they girls or friends reminds me of how unhappy I am makes me want to stay inside,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of discontent and a comparison to others who seem happier with their social relationships. however, the overall tone suggests a more generalized unhappiness rather than specific indicators of loneliness. while the individual acknowledges feeling unhappy when seeing others with their friends or partners, there is no mention of a desire for companionship or feelings of isolation. instead, the focus is on the contrast between their own state and the perceived happiness of others, which can be a sign of broader dissatisfaction rather than loneliness. the absence of expressions of longing for connection or distress over being alone supports this interpretation."
"Seeing Bad Partness just fills me with hateI've always liked romance stuff ever since i was a kid (disney does that to a boy) im always fantasizing about having a partner, which i heard is normal for lonely people aniway, i came to a point i feel guilty about looking, even accidentally at girls, feeling like im betraying a gf i dont even have. 

Which is why i really hate people that dont give enough attention to their SO's, i really cant relate to a guy who choose to play fortnite for 3 hours instead of being with his love or a husband that goes out with his mates at the weekends and leaves his wife alone not even wanting to help with housework

seriously if i had someone to love i woudnt want anything more in my life, all the games i play or movies i watch i dont even enjoy that much, its just past time until i have something better to do, i really preffer to spend time doing housework and cooking than doing that, if i dated i would put her as my top priority be the cheesiest clingiest most romantic bf ever conceived, im really jealous of happy couples but really despiseful of disinterested ones

like, im a crazy? does someone relate?",0,"the narrative describes an individual who expresses strong feelings towards romantic relationships and a deep desire for a partner. the person fantasizes about romance and feels guilty even looking at girls, which shows a high level of emotional investment in the idea of a relationship. they also exhibit frustration and resentment towards people who, in their view, neglect their partners. despite these intense feelings and the significant value placed on relationships, the person does not exhibit signs of social isolation or detachment from others. instead, their narrative is more about idealizing romance and feeling strongly about how relationships should be treated. the focus on activities like housework and cooking, and their disdain for disinterested partners, indicates a preference for meaningful connections rather than an absence of social interaction or companionship."
"Does anyone think love exists, but just not for them?Because that's how I feel at this point. I've seen people that I honestly know are in love, and are happy. I just feel that, that person doesn't exist for me. Anyone else feel the same?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of questioning and self-reflection about the existence of love in one's life. while the individual expresses doubt about finding love for themselves, there is an acknowledgment of the existence of love in others' lives, which suggests an awareness of and connection to social norms and experiences. the language used, such as ""i've seen people that i honestly know are in love,"" indicates that the person is observant and engaged with their surroundings, rather than isolated. the phrasing ""anyone else feel the same?"" shows a desire for shared understanding and connection with others, which implies that the person is reaching out and seeking validation from their social environment. these elements point to an individual who may be experiencing disappointment or frustration, but not necessarily the deeper, more pervasive sense of isolation that characterizes loneliness."
"Lost my wife AND the love of my life.I found myself in an emotionally abusive marriage, where my wife was the abuser. On her suggestion, our last year of marriage was open. Surprisingly, I met this stunningly beautiful woman who was new at my work who ended up agreeing to be my side thing. She and the wife got along fine and we all became friends. Eventually the wife started pushing for threesomes, which at first, I was super excited about!

Eventually, the wife being so pushy ended up causing my fwb to not be interested in sex with either of us anymore, because even when it was just me and her, the wife would always have something to say about it, despite her having her own side thing (my former best friend). 

Thing is, the side chick is actually awesome. She's not perfect by any means, but I swear to God she's perfect for me. I love her. I truly believe she's the one I'm meant to be with. But now, she's gone, ran away from my wife and I not long before I eventually left her. I have no contact with her anymore, so now I've lost my wife, (which I'm not super upset about, but still, it's someone I shared a bed with for a decade) and I've lost this amazing woman that I love like I've never loved anyone before. 

So I spend my nights browsing tinder and plenty of fish, sending messages that mostly never even get read, and crying myself to sleep.",0,"the narrative describes a tumultuous and emotionally draining relationship history, but there are several aspects that suggest the individual is not experiencing loneliness in the clinical sense. despite the pain of losing both his wife and the woman he loved, the author actively engages in efforts to connect with others through dating apps, indicating a proactive approach to finding companionship. the mention of crying oneself to sleep highlights emotional distress, but it does not necessarily equate to loneliness if the individual is still seeking and open to new relationships. the narrative also reflects a level of self-awareness and reflection on past relationships, which can be a sign of emotional resilience rather than loneliness. overall, the author's ongoing attempts to reach out and the nuanced understanding of his own feelings suggest that while he is experiencing significant loss and sadness, he may not be enduring the pervasive sense of isolation that characterizes loneliness."

Someone you can talk to all the time, make plans with, go on adventures, fall asleep on their couch, have game nights with, that kind of thing. I don't have that. How do you ask for friends like that? Am I the only one?",0,"the narrative describes a person who is awake at 4am and is seeking company, which could indicate a desire for social interaction. however, the person mentions that they do not miss their 20s but feel they wasted them, particularly in terms of making friends. they express a longing for close friendships, describing activities typically associated with close friends, such as making plans, going on adventures, and having game nights. despite this, the narrative does not convey a deep sense of emotional distress or isolation. the author mentions checking on people occasionally, suggesting they have some social connections, even if they are not as close as desired. this indicates that while the person may be experiencing some dissatisfaction with their social life, it does not necessarily amount to significant loneliness. the narrative reflects a common concern about social fulfillment rather than a profound sense of loneliness."
Time wins in the end[deleted],0,"the narrative ""time wins in the end"" suggests a resigned acceptance of life's inevitable progression. the phrase itself does not inherently indicate feelings of loneliness; rather, it reflects a broader contemplation on the passage of time and the ultimate outcome of all endeavors. this kind of philosophical musing is common and can be a sign of introspection rather than isolation. there are no explicit references to social disconnection, feelings of being misunderstood, or a lack of meaningful relationships, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on an abstract concept, devoid of personal emotional context or social dynamics, supporting the interpretation that the author is not experiencing loneliness."
"Looking to meet people, been alone for a while [17]I was hoping to meet some people on here even though it never works, I wanted to try meeting others anyway.

It seems as though right now all I can do is wallow in my lonely sadness waiting for the time when I can have a love that I dream of. It may be several years until that time comes but i hope it??s as great as I??ve dreamed. I listen to music about love and heartbreak longing to know the pain of losing someone who??s heart was intertwined with your being. The pain that you lost half of yourself. That pain for some reason in my eyes is beautiful just because they have those memories that are so pure which define the reason for living. Why live to be lonely and long to have someone to love. Recently it??s been difficult to focus on the work around me, it doesn??t make sense to focus on the reality if it??s not the pure moments I wish to keep in my memory forever. Those memories that give elder people the will to live, only to be able to look back on their beautiful past.

It??s kinda weird to think about, but sometimes I wonder if people daydream about me like how I do about other people. Building stories and scenarios in their mind about how we??d fall in love and build our life together. Dream about the cute romantic scenarios playing out only in the mind leaving yourself dissatisfied and only more lonely than ever. It??s honestly scary to think that no person would ever think about you like that. If that were to happen it would only mean that the amount of hope for you to have that perfect romantic story book love is so slim to impossible. Also would mean that people don??t like you. Sometimes I wish I could know who liked me because I feel like I would be surprised for some reason. In highschool, it??s like the time before college, a time where you find out who you are. In highschool nobody knows and it??s difficult to know who you are in a spectrum of aspects, especially with who you like romantically. It??s really scary to think that I may never find the person I??m meant to live the rest of my life with. My heart feels empty most of the time as if there is someone to meet in my future that will fill the void that causes me so much pain inside me. I??ve urned to find someone to fill that part of me now more than ever. It hurts to be lonely not only emotionally, but a distinct pain deep inside that you can feel intensely that rarely leaves you.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep emotional struggle and a sense of yearning for romantic connection, which are common experiences during adolescence. the author expresses feelings of sadness and loneliness, particularly in relation to their struggles with sexuality and the desire for a meaningful romantic relationship. the entries highlight a sense of waiting and longing for a future love, coupled with a difficulty in focusing on present tasks due to this emotional turmoil. the author also contemplates the idea of being thought about by others in a romantic context, revealing a fear of being unloved or unnoticed. this introspective and vulnerable reflection underscores the emotional pain and the intense desire for connection that the author experiences, which are significant indicators of loneliness."

So, Idk, dm if you wanna talk, Ig",0,"the narrative describes an individual who acknowledges the absence of local friends but finds solace and fulfillment in online relationships. despite the physical distance from others, the person does not express a deep sense of isolation or distress. instead, they exhibit openness to forming new connections online and seem content with their current state of meaningful online relationships. this adaptability and satisfaction with virtual interactions suggest that the individual does not experience significant loneliness. their proactive approach to seeking out new friendships and the positive mention of existing online connections further support the idea that they are coping well with their social situation."
"Possible betrayal?Hey, names Jerome, i'm 17 years old and i just finished high school. I want to talk about something i pissed me off yesterday, so a day before my graduation ceremony i met a girl named Abby, we had a good talk and everything, before i left i asked for her number, she gives me her instagram @ instead. I dm'ed her but she didn't respond, the next day, we see each other again at the graduation ceremony, we talked for a bit until the graduation started. Afterwards i asked her if i added her on instagram because she didn't even see my messages even though she was active yesterday, she said that she lost her phone but will text me if she finds it. Days later she hasn't ""found her phone"". Then one day i was on facebook doing my thing as usual and then suddenly i thought to myself, what if she has a facebook, so I look up her name and her page pops up, then I sent her a friend request but a few days later she blocks me and friended another person at her old school, which is confusing considering the fact that she told me that she lost her phone. Few days later i almost lost my mind, i was confused and angry because i thought that girl was cool and i wanted to get to know her more and get with her so that all of the problems that i had in the past would go away, she even said that i was a cool dude when i asked for her number or ig. Maybe i'm overreacting, i'm not sure what's going on but i need answers. I'm not going to deal with another failed relationship with a female. I don't know what's up with me but at this point i feel like i've lost my sanity.",0,"jerome's narrative revolves around a frustrating and confusing encounter with a girl named abby, where his expectations of forming a connection were unmet. his initial excitement about meeting her and the subsequent disappointment when she seemingly avoids him is a common experience among teenagers navigating social relationships. despite his feelings of confusion and anger, jerome's primary concern appears to be understanding abby's actions rather than expressing deep-seated feelings of isolation or loneliness. his narrative focuses on the specific incident and his reaction to it, rather than a broader sense of disconnection from others. while he mentions past problems and a desire to avoid another failed relationship, this seems more about seeking resolution and validation rather than expressing a pervasive sense of loneliness. overall, jerome's frustration is contextual and situational, indicating typical adolescent social struggles rather than chronic loneliness."

Thank you for reading",0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and self-doubt, which are common indicators of loneliness. the individual mentions repeated attempts to connect with others, including a psychiatrist, friends, and family, only to be met with dismissal or belittlement. this repeated rejection likely exacerbates their feelings of worthlessness and invisibility. they describe a pervasive fear of being alone forever, never forming relationships or friendships, and ultimately living a life of solitude. such thoughts are often associated with loneliness, as they reflect a deep-seated belief that one is unworthy of connection and destined to be forgotten. the narrative also highlights a lack of accomplishment and a sense of being a burden, further contributing to their sense of isolation and loneliness. these aspects are typical indicators of loneliness because they underscore the individual's struggle to find meaningful connections and a sense of belonging."
I have no self worth anymore because of loneliness[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a struggle with self-worth, which can be a symptom of various mental health issues, but the context and specific wording suggest a broader emotional or psychological struggle rather than loneliness alone. the phrase ""because of loneliness"" might be a placeholder for deeper underlying issues. people who are not necessarily lonely can still experience a significant decline in self-worth due to factors like depression, anxiety, or other life stressors. the absence of specific details about social isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being left out suggests that loneliness might not be the primary issue here. instead, the focus on self-worth points towards a more complex emotional state that isn't solely defined by loneliness."

Feel free to message me.",0,"the narrative describes someone who recently moved and experienced a breakup, which are significant life changes that could potentially lead to feelings of loneliness. however, despite these circumstances, the individual is actively seeking new social connections by inviting others to message them. this proactive approach indicates a level of social engagement and a desire to build new relationships. the person is also open about their situation and seems hopeful about forming new friendships or more meaningful connections. these aspects suggest resilience and an ability to cope with changes rather than succumbing to loneliness. therefore, the narrative does not exhibit strong indicators of loneliness, as the individual is taking steps to mitigate isolation and is not expressing pervasive feelings of being alone or disconnected."
"I haven't received a compliment in such a long time.It really does affect your self-esteem when people look at you and think there's nothing special. I'm such an average person i have no stand out qualities, i literally got C's throughout my school year, so i don't really blame them but it would be nice just to be appreciated once in my life.",0,"the narrative reflects a struggle with self-esteem and a desire for appreciation, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual's focus is on external validation and their academic performance, which are more aligned with issues of self-worth rather than social isolation. the lack of compliments and feelings of being average contribute to their low self-esteem, but there is no mention of a lack of social connections or feelings of being alone. the desire for appreciation suggests a craving for recognition rather than companionship, highlighting an internal conflict with self-perception rather than an external issue of loneliness."
"Anyone wanna chat? ????Lonely, sad, interested in sexy chat and norm chat ????",0,"the narrative reflects an individual's desire for interaction and connection, but it does not necessarily indicate a deeper sense of loneliness. the request for chat, both ""sexy"" and ""norm,"" suggests a search for casual engagement rather than a cry for help or a sign of profound isolation. the use of emoticons and informal language indicates a playful tone rather than a desperate one. while the word ""lonely"" is mentioned, it seems more like a casual expression rather than a significant emotional state. overall, the context and manner of expression do not strongly align with typical indicators of loneliness, such as expressions of despair, hopelessness, or a lack of meaningful connections."

How to get more friends?[deleted],0,"the narrative indicates an interest in social connection and a proactive approach to increasing one's social circle, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. asking how to get more friends suggests a desire for social engagement rather than an experience of isolation. the brevity and directness of the question imply a practical mindset focused on problem-solving rather than expressing feelings of sadness or isolation. without further context or emotional depth, this narrative does not exhibit the common signs of loneliness, such as expressions of feeling disconnected, unworthy, or experiencing a lack of meaningful relationships. instead, it shows a functional and goal-oriented attitude toward social interaction."
Anyone down for a voice chat?Title,0,"the narrative suggests a person seeking social interaction, but the phrasing indicates a casual or spontaneous interest rather than a deep-seated need. the use of ""anyone down"" implies a relaxed, open invitation rather than a desperate plea for connection. this kind of language is often used in contexts where the individual is looking for entertainment or casual conversation, not necessarily stemming from feelings of loneliness. there is no mention of emotional distress, isolation, or a lack of meaningful relationships, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the narrative seems to reflect a desire for immediate social engagement, typical of someone who is comfortable and socially active, rather than someone experiencing loneliness."

What's the best part of being alone?I know we all post in here because of our struggles with loneliness and being alone but what do you think are some of the positives of being alone in general?,0,"the narrative reflects an attempt to find positivity in solitude, which suggests a proactive and possibly content mindset. the author acknowledges the common struggles associated with loneliness but is focusing on the benefits, indicating a level of acceptance and adaptation. this approach is often seen in individuals who are comfortable with solitude and do not necessarily feel lonely. the inquiry about the positives of being alone demonstrates a reflective and possibly optimistic outlook, seeking to reframe the experience in a constructive manner. this perspective is typically less associated with feelings of loneliness and more with a balanced or even fulfilling experience of being alone."

 Even in my dreams I can't be that social",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of social awkwardness and self-consciousness, particularly in interactions with peers. the dream described includes elements of fear and concern about social performance, such as worrying about something bad happening when asked to perform a task and feeling awkward even in a subconscious state. however, there are also moments that suggest some level of social interaction and acknowledgment from others, such as the girl who occasionally talks to the narrator in real life and the class clapping for their actions. these interactions indicate that the individual is not entirely isolated and has some social connections, even if they feel awkward or shy. the emphasis on being awkward rather than isolated, combined with the presence of some social interactions, suggests that the individual may struggle with social confidence but is not necessarily experiencing profound loneliness."
"Sick and tiredIt's not that often I get sick,  but I'm really feeling crummy these past few days,  and wish I had someone in my life to take care of me.",0,"the narrative reflects a momentary feeling of illness and a desire for companionship during this vulnerable time. while the individual expresses a wish for someone to take care of them, this sentiment does not necessarily indicate a deeper, ongoing experience of loneliness. it is common for people to seek support and care when they are unwell, and this temporary need for attention and comfort is a natural response to feeling physically unwell. the context of the narrative suggests that the person's primary concern is their current state of health rather than a chronic sense of isolation or loneliness. therefore, the desire for companionship in this scenario appears situational and linked to their temporary physical condition rather than indicative of a broader, persistent feeling of loneliness."
"the good thing about nobody giving a shit about you is that your suicide won??t cause any grief amongst othersnot looking for any help, just letting my thoughts out",0,"the narrative, despite its dark tone, does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author mentions that they are not looking for any help, which suggests a certain level of self-sufficiency and acceptance of their situation. the statement about nobody giving a shit might reflect a perception of social disconnection, but it does not inherently mean the individual is feeling lonely. some people may feel disconnected or misunderstood by society at large without experiencing the emotional pain of loneliness. the act of ""letting my thoughts out"" could also imply a form of coping mechanism rather than a plea for connection. overall, the narrative lacks explicit expressions of yearning for companionship or distress over being alone, which are more direct indicators of loneliness."
"DisappointedHow do you deal best with being disappointed after getting your hopes up talking to a person?
And also what's a good way to pass time.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual seeking advice on coping mechanisms for disappointment and ways to pass time, which does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the person mentions getting their hopes up after talking to someone, suggesting they have social interactions and expectations from these interactions. their primary concern seems to be managing disappointment rather than expressing feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. the inquiry about passing time can be interpreted as looking for engaging activities rather than a sign of loneliness. the focus on practical advice and problem-solving, rather than expressing emotional distress related to social isolation, aligns with someone who may be facing temporary emotional challenges but not chronic loneliness."

"Pretty lonelyHi. Got the day off today and I??m feeling really lonely and was wondering if anyone would be up for a chat, maybe even on a regular basis? Feel free to message me if you??d like. I??m 30/M from the UK",0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction, but the tone and context suggest that the individual is taking proactive steps to alleviate their feelings of loneliness. by reaching out and expressing a willingness to engage in conversation, the individual demonstrates a level of agency and openness to forming connections. the request for regular chats implies an intention to build ongoing relationships, which is a positive and constructive approach to addressing social needs. the straightforward and casual manner in which the person communicates their situation also suggests a level of comfort in seeking support, which may indicate they are not deeply entrenched in feelings of loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a situational desire for companionship rather than chronic or pervasive loneliness."
"I've found a guy on youtube that cures loneliness :DHis videos feel like talking to an old buddy you haven't seen in a while. Really personal in a good way. Here's a great example:  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKcJlvTwHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaKcJlvTwHw)",0,"the narrative describes a positive and uplifting experience where the individual has found solace and companionship through youtube videos. the mention of the videos feeling like talking to an old buddy suggests a sense of connection and comfort. this indicates that the person feels a sense of social interaction and emotional fulfillment from these videos, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, they reflect a state of contentment and engagement. the use of phrases like ""really personal in a good way"" further supports the idea that the individual feels a meaningful connection, reducing the likelihood of loneliness."
"When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around.Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?nan",0,"the narrative presents a philosophical reflection on existence and presence, using the metaphor of falling in a forest with no one around. this contemplation does not inherently suggest loneliness but rather a deeper, existential inquiry about the nature of reality and perception. the absence of direct emotional expressions, such as feelings of isolation or longing for social connection, supports the interpretation that the author is engaging in abstract thought rather than expressing personal loneliness. the use of rhetorical questions indicates a curiosity about the nature of experience rather than a cry for companionship or acknowledgment. these elements are more indicative of introspection and philosophical musing rather than the emotional state associated with loneliness."
"I have this awful habitI find the people who are broken and hurt and I give them my all

I give them every ounce of my heart I can

I put everything into being there for them and trying to help

And then I excuse them being awful to me as them being hurt

I let things slide I shouldn??t

I give them my everything and then I fall apart when they??re done with me",0,"the narrative describes a pattern of behavior where the individual invests heavily in helping others who are broken and hurt, often at the expense of their own well-being. they mention giving every ounce of their heart and excusing hurtful behavior from others. while this might indicate a tendency towards codependency or a need to feel needed, it does not necessarily point to loneliness. the focus is on their actions towards others and the emotional toll it takes on them, rather than a sense of isolation or lack of meaningful connections. this suggests that the individual's primary struggle is with boundaries and self-care, rather than loneliness. their narrative does not express a longing for connection or an absence of relationships, but rather a detrimental pattern within existing relationships."
"What's the most loneliest thing u have ever done? I'll go first.This happened during my birthday party, I invited atleast 10 ppl but... None came. So I drank some beer and started crying about that. 

And I would wait for someone to atleast text me ""Happy birthday Jade"" But none. So I just  whispered happy birthday to myself. 


What's your story?",0,"the narrative details a personal experience during a birthday party where the individual invited ten people, but none showed up. despite this, the person chose to drink beer and cried about the situation, expressing a desire for someone to acknowledge their birthday. while these actions might initially seem indicative of loneliness, they could also reflect a momentary disappointment rather than a chronic state of loneliness. the fact that the individual reached out to others by inviting them and was hopeful for birthday wishes suggests a level of social engagement and expectation of connection. the emotional response of crying and whispering ""happy birthday"" to themselves can be seen as a natural reaction to unmet social expectations rather than a deeper, pervasive sense of loneliness. this narrative may indicate a temporary feeling of isolation rather than a sustained experience of loneliness."
"And I wait.So he tells you it won't be late (at work) and you keep waiting and it gets to be 11 o'clock and you think ""ok, maybe he'll be done soon"" so you take your shower and you wait some more and then you fall asleep. You wake up and it's 1 am and your heart falls a little and you think ""ok, maybe it's taking longer than he expected"" but then you start to think back about your day and wonder if maybe you said something or your frantic stressed out evening with the kids is making him stay away longer and your heart falls even further. You fall asleep again and the next time you wake up it's even later, and your heart falls even further, you take the dog out and brush your teeth and sigh and crawl into bed wondering what happened, especially because the only communication you've had since 10:23 was a group chat Reddit post. You try to shake the feeling that you caused it because maybe he just got stuck or is having a hard time focusing. So you sit in the dark in your bed not wanting to text because you feel like your text will just make him feel frustrated or angry and your heart sinks further and further in your chest until you chest feels empty and aching. 
And even now, I picture you reading this with a scrunched up annoyed look on your face and scratching the back of your head like you do when you're frustrated. And my heart feels even emptier.",0,"the narrative describes a person waiting for their partner to come home late from work, experiencing a series of emotions ranging from hopefulness to disappointment and self-doubt. the detailed account of their thoughts and feelings suggests a strong emotional connection and concern for their partner. they reflect on their own actions and worry about causing frustration or anger, but this introspection is more indicative of relationship dynamics rather than loneliness. the presence of a partner, even if they are late, and the vivid imagery of their partner's reactions demonstrate an ongoing, albeit strained, interaction. the emotional depth and concern for the partner's feelings suggest that the individual is engaged in a significant relationship, which typically mitigates feelings of loneliness."
"A nice little ventI??m finding it difficult to cope with the fact I have no friends, I speak to around 3 people at school but don??t have any outside connection with them outside. Regardless I feel invisible sometimes, as I sit alone surrounded by people in their individual groups. I??ve recently lost a group of friends due to a falling out but this seems to be a recurring thing for me, I??ve not had a stable friendship for over 4 years now, and I??m not sure what I??m doing wrong. This cycle started all since my best friend of 8 years decided to stop talking to me one day and stay with this guy instead - I never got clarification why they stopped talking to me. As the weather is getting nicer I??m starting to feel very isolated seeing people on social media with their friends all having a good time. I feel like I??ve wasted my teenage years dwelling on the fact I??ve been unable to successfully make any friends and I don??t know what to do anymore :/",0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of isolation and social disconnection, highlighting the individual's struggle with maintaining friendships and feeling invisible among peers. despite speaking to a few people at school, the lack of meaningful connections outside of this environment exacerbates feelings of loneliness. the recurring theme of losing friends and the inability to form stable relationships over the past four years is a significant indicator of the individual's social struggles. the mention of a best friend abruptly cutting off contact without explanation further deepens the sense of abandonment and confusion. the narrative also touches on the impact of social media, where seeing others enjoy social activities intensifies feelings of isolation and regret about wasted teenage years. overall, the narrative is rich with elements that suggest a deep-seated experience of loneliness and social isolation."
I just want a hugTitle says it all. I??ve had zero significant human contact since February. And it literally hurts.. I Don??t know. I??m tired and sad,0,"the narrative reflects a deep yearning for human connection and physical touch, which is a common human need. the writer mentions a lack of significant human contact since february and describes feeling tired and sad, suggesting emotional distress. however, these feelings alone do not necessarily indicate chronic loneliness. the context implies a situational factor, possibly due to external circumstances like a pandemic, which has temporarily disrupted normal social interactions. while the desire for a hug and the accompanying sadness are evident, they may be responses to a specific period of isolation rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness. this situational context is crucial in understanding that the narrative may reflect temporary emotional distress rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
Do you ever imagine some friends I'll imagine real people I knew and have pretend conversations with them. Or when I have something cool I want to show someone but  no someone. I'll just start explaining it to myself. I do image friends sometimes though. Almost always people who are nice.,0,"the narrative describes a person engaging in imaginative play and self-conversation, which can be a common and healthy coping mechanism. they mention imagining friends and having pretend conversations with people they knew, which can be a sign of creativity rather than loneliness. the focus on wanting to share something cool and explaining it to themselves suggests a need for self-expression rather than a lack of social connection. the mention of imagining friends who are nice indicates a positive and hopeful outlook rather than a sense of isolation. these behaviors can be typical of someone who enjoys their own company and has an active imagination, rather than someone experiencing loneliness."
How do I stop asking questionsWhenever I text someone I??m always rolling the beats of the conversation. I don??t know how to.. I guess..not? It??s so weird because they barely give me anything back. I feel like I??m annoying them.,0,"the narrative reflects a common social anxiety rather than loneliness. the individual expresses concern about their conversational habits, specifically their tendency to ask many questions and drive the conversation. they acknowledge the lack of reciprocal engagement from the other party, which makes them feel annoying. this indicates a focus on social skills and a desire for better communication rather than a deep sense of isolation or loneliness. the worry about being annoying suggests a self-awareness and a desire to improve social interactions, typical of someone who is socially engaged but perhaps insecure about their social abilities."
"Having trouble adjusting my emotionsIt's been a few rough weeks. I usually think I'm in an okay mindset but it only lasts until I get home and am alone for the weekend. My cat of 17 years died last Monday so it's been so weird and empty to come home to my empty bedroom. I want to get a fish tank and have something to give attention to until I fully process the loss. 

My birthday was the Monday before that and I was depressed the whole time...not because I was getting older but because I had realized how lonely I was under these circumstances in this part of my life. I want to do things to help myself and have slowly done things off of my list (i.e. therapy/meds, self care, work/sleep schedule) but have still had issues being social and finding new things to enjoy or even keep up with due to my bipolar II depressive episodes. I don't really know where to go from there.

I had the thought lately to try doing online streaming (Tiktok? Twitch? Reddit?) but I have never done any of that before and really know nothing about it aside from the fear of being sexualized because I'm used to that response any time I had ever tried to make friends. Does anyone have advice? Hope you're all doing okay. &lt;3",0,"the narrative depicts a person experiencing significant emotional distress and recent loss, which are contributing to feelings of emptiness and difficulty adjusting their emotions. the individual mentions the death of a long-time pet, which has left their home feeling empty and has exacerbated their sense of loneliness. they also reflect on their recent birthday, acknowledging a deeper realization of their loneliness during this period of their life. despite these challenges, the person is actively seeking ways to cope and improve their situation, such as engaging in therapy, self-care routines, and considering new hobbies like online streaming. they express a desire for connection and advice, which indicates a proactive approach to managing their emotional well-being. while the narrative contains elements commonly associated with loneliness, such as feelings of emptiness and social isolation, the individual's efforts to seek help and explore new activities suggest they are not solely defined by their loneliness. the presence of a support-seeking attitude and willingness to try new things highlights their resilience and determination to overcome their current emotional struggles."
"Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up ???? based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real ????), continent ??????? , willingness to share pictures ???? or voice calls ????, studying/working status and more ???!Yo internet travelers  of 2021! As we all know, 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which led /u/finder_of_the_humans/ to spend a whole fucking year on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to talk to. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while in the way it works (hence my posts) .

**So how does it work?**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. For each question, you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out friend requests to these users, (or receive requests from them), and once either of you have accepted a request, you get connected with that person, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* \- Reach! Over 4500 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less
* \- Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* \- more about you- age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* \- best part of your day
* \- gender
* \- sexuality
* \- interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* \- geographical continent
* \- how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* \- type of friendship
* \- whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* \- whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* \- religious
* \- working
* \- studying
* \- video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* \- whether you want to **hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'** (this could be a life saver for some of yall)

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things.

* You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info.
* There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.
* And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

The link is: [https://findafriend.club/howitworks](https://findafriend.club/howitworks)

This is an example of the UI  for a ""match"": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ESIf) you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

**Extra info:**

* \- You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* \- Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* \- You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* \- Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* \- You can see your matches instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* \- This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. We're looking for help if you want to help, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
* \- /u/finder_of_the_humans/ runs this project, I'm helping out with getting more attention. A big big thank you to them :)",0,"the narrative exudes enthusiasm and positivity, focusing on connecting people through a well-structured matching system. the author describes a project designed to foster friendships by aligning interests, communication preferences, and personal attributes. they highlight the project's reach, efficiency, and user-friendly nature, suggesting it as a solution to the isolation many felt during 2020. the tone is upbeat and encouraging, urging readers to participate and emphasizing the benefits of meeting new people. the detailed explanation of how the project works, coupled with reassurances about privacy and anonymity, reflects a proactive approach to social interaction rather than a sense of loneliness. the narrative's focus on community building and active engagement with others indicates a mindset oriented towards connection and shared experiences, rather than solitude or isolation."
"Celebrating New Years Eve alone for the first timeA month ago I lost all of my friends and a few days ago, my boyfriend and I broke up. This is the first year I don??t have a fun get-together and not share a special night with a person who I used to have by my side everyday. 

I feel.. truly.. alone..",0,"the narrative describes a person who has recently experienced significant losses in their social and romantic life, including the end of friendships and a breakup with their boyfriend. despite the immediate and intense feelings of solitude expressed, such as spending new year's eve alone and missing the companionship of close individuals, these sentiments can be situational and not necessarily indicative of chronic loneliness. the context of recent events suggests a temporary state of isolation rather than a prolonged experience of loneliness. while the person feels alone at this moment, it may be a reaction to recent changes rather than a deeper, ongoing issue with loneliness."
"Anyone want to talk?I??ll do my best to respond, I??m not that great of a talker but I??ll try",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is open to communication and willing to engage with others despite acknowledging their own perceived shortcomings in conversational skills. this willingness to reach out and make an effort to connect, even if they feel they are not great at talking, indicates a proactive approach to social interaction. such behavior is typically associated with someone who is not experiencing significant loneliness, as they are actively seeking and maintaining social connections. their expression of effort and openness to dialogue reflects a positive social engagement, which is a key factor in mitigating feelings of loneliness. the tone does not convey a sense of isolation or desperation but rather a genuine, albeit modest, attempt to be part of a social exchange."
"I just want my birthday to be overIt??s my birthday today and it??s going about as shitty as I thought. I usually hate it anyways but today felt particularly worse for some reason. I spent all day working and, for whatever reason, everything piled up literally until the end of the day. I started at 8am and just getting off at 7pm. And now the day is almost over and I have had 0 thought into anything I could potentially do to enjoy it.

On top of that I??m really lonely. I moved to a new city last year and have made almost no friends. And I work from home. But what??s worse is the birthday wishes. I don??t get that many calls or texts anyways but when I do get a call everyone asks me how I??m going to celebrate. And when I say idk or I??m not, or seem apathetic to it being my birthday they question why I??m not doing something awesome or great.

I??m sorry if this is a long stupid rant but I just want to complain about something for once and not feel ok instead of telling me just to be happy; as if I like feeling like crap.",0,"the narrative describes a birthday experience that feels particularly disappointing and unfulfilling for the individual. despite working all day and feeling overwhelmed, the person expresses a lack of excitement or plans for their birthday. the mention of moving to a new city and having few friends, along with working from home, suggests a limited social circle. however, the person's frustration seems more focused on the expectations others have for their birthday rather than a deep-seated feeling of loneliness. the emphasis on wanting to complain and express dissatisfaction indicates a temporary emotional state rather than a chronic sense of isolation. while there are elements of social disconnection, the primary tone revolves around frustration with the day's events and external pressures, rather than an ongoing experience of loneliness."
"If we are lonely despite being on reddit, does it mean our situation is hopeless?I really don't know what else to do at this point. I am contemplating giving up and cutting off from the world for good, but I am afraid it wouldn't be good for my mental health to isolate like that. So basically I will just have to endure this frustration endlessly and hopelessly",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of frustration and contemplation about isolation, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual questions their situation and its implications for their mental health, showing an awareness of the potential negative impact of isolation. the mention of reddit suggests they are seeking connection and engagement, which implies they are not entirely cut off from social interactions. their concern about the effects of isolation on their mental health indicates a level of self-awareness and a desire to avoid worsening their situation. overall, the narrative reflects a struggle with frustration and mental health concerns rather than a direct experience of loneliness."
keep me company? i'm all alone:(,0,"the narrative ""keep me company? i am all alone:("" might initially seem like a cry for help, but upon closer examination, it can be interpreted as a casual or light-hearted expression rather than a profound sense of loneliness. the use of a sad face emoticon often conveys a more playful or less serious tone in digital communication, which might suggest that the individual is not deeply affected by loneliness but is instead expressing a temporary or situational feeling. this could be akin to someone casually asking for company out of boredom rather than a deep-seated emotional need. the brevity of the message and the informal language also contribute to the impression that this is not a serious plea for help. such expressions are common in social interactions where individuals might seek attention or companionship without necessarily experiencing chronic loneliness. thus, the narrative lacks the depth and intensity typically associated with genuine feelings of loneliness, such as detailed descriptions of isolation, emotional pain, or a sense of disconnection from others."
"I am insulted by my own existenceI can't hide the pain anymore, i can't talk to anybody cause nobody will listen to me. I'm too alone and broken, isolated from anything and hopeless. I have bipolar disorder and i feel anger and depression all the time and i don't cope with anything, so I'm completely uncovered from the attacks",0,"the narrative reflects deep emotional distress and a sense of isolation, but it is crucial to differentiate between clinical symptoms of a mental health disorder and the specific experience of loneliness. the individual mentions suffering from bipolar disorder, which includes feelings of anger and depression, indicating severe mental health struggles. the expression of being ""insulted by my own existence"" and feeling ""too alone and broken"" suggests a profound sense of self-worthlessness and despair. however, these feelings are often associated with the symptomatic experience of bipolar disorder rather than loneliness per se. while the person feels isolated and believes that ""nobody will listen,"" these perceptions can stem from the disorder's impact on their social interactions and self-perception. the narrative does not provide sufficient evidence of a lack of social connections or a longing for companionship, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, it emphasizes the individual's struggle with their mental health condition, which can lead to feelings of isolation but does not necessarily equate to loneliness as defined in this context."
just a virtual hug maybe?can i get a hug? there's too much on my mind and i can't focus on anything. i feel so isolated,0,"the narrative reflects a strong sense of isolation and a clear request for emotional support, which are often indicators of loneliness. however, the label suggests that despite these expressions, the individual may not be experiencing loneliness in a clinical sense. it's possible that their feelings of isolation are situational or temporary rather than chronic. the request for a virtual hug and the mention of having too much on their mind could indicate stress or overwhelm rather than a deeper, more pervasive sense of loneliness. while the language used points to a need for connection, it might not be sufficient to classify the person as experiencing loneliness, suggesting that their social support system or coping mechanisms are still intact."
"Has quarantine made me insane?No friends. No fulfilling relationships. Barely any family contact, just my mom once in a while. Hard to set up a date with anyone. Feeling like I??m consumed by this deep, debilitating loneliness. I am a complete no-name. I feel like I am stuck on an island with nowhere to go.",0,"the narrative describes a situation where the individual is experiencing significant social isolation, which is typically associated with loneliness. the mention of having no friends, no fulfilling relationships, and barely any family contact highlights a lack of social support and meaningful connections. the difficulty in setting up dates suggests a struggle with forming new relationships, contributing to feelings of loneliness. the expression of feeling consumed by deep, debilitating loneliness and the metaphor of being stuck on an island with nowhere to go further emphasize a sense of isolation and disconnection. these elements are common indicators of loneliness, making it crucial to consider the psychological impact of such experiences on the individual's well-being."
Anyone up for an audio call?Scottish guy here looking for a chill call on discord with someone while I chill out before bed,0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is seeking a casual and relaxed interaction before bedtime. the request for an audio call appears to be more about wanting a pleasant and light-hearted conversation rather than a deep need for social connection. the tone is upbeat and the person seems to be engaging in a common social activity rather than expressing feelings of isolation or distress. the specificity of wanting a ""chill call"" and the mention of ""chilling out before bed"" indicate a desire for comfort and routine rather than a response to loneliness. overall, the narrative lacks the typical signs of loneliness such as expressing feelings of sadness, isolation, or a longing for meaningful connection. instead, it portrays a scenario where the individual is looking for a simple and enjoyable interaction."
I've been ghosted againAll I want is a woman who can know everything about me and tell me it's okay to be me and she loves who I am. Is that really too much to ask?,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of frustration and disappointment, which are common human experiences but not necessarily indicators of loneliness. the individual expresses a desire for validation and acceptance in a romantic relationship, which is a typical longing for emotional connection. however, the language used does not convey a deep or pervasive sense of isolation. instead, it suggests a specific situational dissatisfaction with romantic encounters. the wish for a partner who appreciates them does not inherently indicate loneliness but rather a normal desire for companionship and understanding. there is no mention of a broader lack of social connections or a pervasive feeling of being alone, which are more direct indicators of loneliness."
"Sometimes I feel like my own dreams taunt me.There've been some nights over the years where I've had dreams where I actually manage to start dating a guy or a girl and feel over the moon about it, only to wake up and remember that it didn't actually happen.

I had a dream last night that was particularly cruel. I was hanging out at some sort of lounge at a club or bar, sitting on a couch with another couch facing it and a coffee table between them, and this really cute guy comes up to me and starts talking to me. After like 5 seconds he just suddenly walks away and goes up to another cute guy who's sitting at the couch across from me and chats him up, only he doesn't walk away from this guy like he did to me. They instead hit it off, and I'm just sitting there looking at my phone and glancing at them every few seconds. As their conversation goes, the move closer together, then they're holding each other, then one of the guys lies back and the other gets on top and they start making out. Then I start silently crying while still pretending to look at my phone, because I so badly wanted what was going on with them to happen to me and it never has, and one of the guys looks at me and laughs, shaking his head. That's when I wake up only to find I was actually crying a bit in real life.

I just don't know why my brain had to go and do this. I was going through a pretty rough patch about how lonely I am, and the past couple of days I was actually feeling a lot better somehow, but then I had to go and have this dream and now I feel really down and shitty again.",0,"the narrative describes a vivid dream that elicits strong emotional responses from the author, highlighting feelings of rejection and longing for companionship. despite the intensity of the dream and the subsequent emotional turmoil, the context provided suggests a temporary emotional state rather than chronic loneliness. the author mentions feeling better in the days leading up to the dream, indicating a fluctuation in mood rather than a persistent sense of isolation. the specific details of the dream, such as the setting in a social environment and the interactions with others, reflect a desire for connection that is not necessarily indicative of ongoing loneliness. the author’s self-awareness and ability to reflect on their emotions also suggest resilience and coping mechanisms that are inconsistent with the deeper, more pervasive feelings typically associated with loneliness."
"exhausted.i??m just so exhausted. i give my whole heart to every guy i end up with and i??m left completely empty and broken every time. usually they just keep me around bc they know i??ll never leave. but they walk all over me, take advantage of how unconditionally and deeply i love and care for people, cheat on me, use me. it??s so exhausting. i just feel so alone yet i??m supposed to feel happy and loved. but i can never leave somebody. i always justify behaviours and convince myself i deserve it. why are people so cruel to people who just love them unconditionally. how can somebody sit there and just walk all over someone who just loves them. i??m so tired of giving everything i am to end up feeling even more alone.",0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of emotional exhaustion and heartbreak stemming from repeated negative experiences in romantic relationships. the individual expresses feelings of being taken advantage of, unappreciated, and used, which are common in those who invest deeply in others without receiving the same level of care in return. despite these painful experiences, the person continues to stay in these relationships, justifying harmful behaviors and internalizing blame. the narrative reveals a struggle with self-worth and a yearning for genuine love and connection, highlighting the individual's vulnerability and the impact of unreciprocated affection. while the feelings of isolation and sadness are evident, the underlying issue seems to be more about the dynamics of the relationships and the individual's response to them rather than an inherent state of loneliness."
Turned 19 today &amp; i feel horribleI couldn't fall asleep the night before so i dealt with &amp; buried most of my feelings but waking up to a Google birthday notification just brought it all back lol,0,"the narrative describes a young person who recently turned 19 and had a difficult time falling asleep the night before their birthday, leading them to suppress their emotions. however, upon waking up to a google birthday notification, these feelings resurfaced. the mention of feeling horrible and the struggle with emotions could initially suggest loneliness, but the context indicates otherwise. the narrative lacks indicators of persistent isolation or a deeper sense of disconnection from others. the reference to receiving a birthday notification implies some level of social engagement, even if it's minimal. the feelings described seem to be more related to the stress and emotional turbulence associated with personal milestones rather than chronic loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a temporary emotional state rather than a prolonged experience of loneliness."
How 2 feel5 years anniversary your sick and he only comes home with two candy bars after showing all these other things he bought other people.  How to feel?,0,"the narrative describes a situation where someone is reflecting on their feelings during a five-year anniversary while being unwell. despite their partner bringing home only two candy bars after showing the other things bought for others, the narrative does not exhibit typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it focuses on the disparity between expectations and reality in a relationship context. there is no mention of pervasive feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a deep sense of emptiness, which are common psychological indicators of loneliness. the narrative seems more concerned with disappointment and questioning the appropriateness of their emotional response rather than expressing a sustained sense of being alone or disconnected from others."
Not being good enoughRecently I??ve noticed how I really stack up against all of my peers and it??s sad. Every single one of them is better at me in all aspects. I??ve also realized how much life wouldn??t change if I were to disappear no one would be sad or even care.  I??ve never be as good as my peers and it sucks buts that??s just reality.,0,"the narrative reflects feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, common emotional experiences that many individuals face at some point. the writer compares themselves to their peers and feels they fall short in various aspects. while these feelings can be distressing, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. the focus is on personal shortcomings and perceived lack of impact on others, rather than on a sense of social isolation or lack of meaningful connections. the absence of direct references to social interactions, friendships, or a desire for companionship suggests that the primary issue here is self-esteem rather than loneliness."
Meet me I??m so depressed.????https://i.imgur.com/DaBVhpa_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium,0,"the narrative ""meet me i??m so depressed.????"" suggests a cry for help and an expression of distress, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the request for someone to meet them implies a desire for social interaction and support, which can be a sign that the individual still maintains social connections and is reaching out to them. while depression and loneliness can be related, they are distinct experiences; this narrative focuses more on the individual's emotional state rather than a sense of social isolation. the use of multiple punctuation marks and the informal tone might reflect a heightened emotional state, but it does not provide enough context to conclude that the person is experiencing loneliness specifically. instead, it highlights their immediate need for emotional support, which they believe can be alleviated through social contact."
"I can't sleep. You asked if something's wrong.The truth is yes, but the easy answer is no because I don't want to have the same unproductive conversation we've had a dozen times already which invariably ends with a fresh rejection.

I need space and time apart to process my feelings for you but I can't walk out on you, especially not right now. You'd say I was abandoning you, and I'd believe it, even though it's not my baby you're expecting in &gt; a week and I know intillectually that I'm not beholden to you. 

We haven't been intimate in months. And it's petty, but you haven't liked or commented on a single selfie I've posted, ever. Granted, I've posted maybe 3 in all the time we've been hanging out but still.

It's possible to have a lonely heart even when you spend your days with the person you love, as long as they don't love you back.

I cherish our time together but at the same time I feel trapped in this situation. I could walk away. But I won't. 

I told you early on when we would still share a bed how deeply you had gotten your hooks into me. I told you I was scared of the power you had  over me because I don't make a habit of falling for people. That hasn't changed even if the intimacy has.",0,"the narrative describes a complex and emotionally charged relationship where the individual feels conflicted and trapped, yet remains connected to another person. despite expressing frustration and dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the relationship, such as the lack of intimacy and feeling unappreciated, the individual does not exhibit classic signs of loneliness. they are actively engaged in the relationship, experiencing strong emotions and a deep connection, albeit a painful one. their struggles seem to stem more from the dynamics of the relationship and unrequited love rather than a sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the person is not devoid of companionship or social interaction; rather, they are entangled in an emotionally taxing situation with someone they care about deeply. this involvement, although distressing, indicates that they are not experiencing loneliness in the traditional sense of lacking meaningful connections."
"Just passing throughI just want to be better. So people will like me. I wish I knew better in the beginning. I could've been so much better and now I have to start from scratch and it's just so hard, cause everyone else is already at the level I want to be. 

It doesnt feel worth continuing. Nobody will ever remember me anyway. Life is too hard when what you want you can't have. My mind keeps moving too much. I wish I had someone. I want to feel loved. I want to know that someone really cares instead of open air. 

Where can I go where I want to be around. I hope in the future it gets better, and I can be in a better place. I won't be ashamed of myself. I can like what I like. And not worry what people think about me.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of self-improvement and aspiration. the individual expresses a desire to be better and to be liked by others, which is a common sentiment but not necessarily indicative of loneliness. the focus is on personal growth and the struggle to reach a certain level of achievement. while there are mentions of feeling behind and the difficulty of starting over, these are more aligned with frustration and self-doubt rather than isolation. the individual also expresses hope for the future and a desire to be in a better place, suggesting an underlying optimism and motivation. the wish for someone to care and to feel loved is a natural human desire, but it doesn't dominate the narrative to the extent that it would indicate pervasive loneliness. instead, it appears as part of a broader struggle with self-worth and societal acceptance."
Why does no one want to be friends with me? Or love me?[deleted],0,"the narrative expresses a sense of confusion and questioning about social relationships, specifically friendships and romantic connections. while these questions might suggest a momentary feeling of isolation or rejection, they do not necessarily indicate a pervasive sense of loneliness. people often experience moments of doubt about their social connections, which can be situational and temporary. the brevity of the narrative and the direct nature of the questions might reflect a passing thought or a specific instance rather than a chronic state of loneliness. without further context or additional expressions of persistent emotional distress, it's challenging to definitively categorize this as an indicator of loneliness. thus, the narrative might be reflecting a normal, albeit painful, experience of social insecurity rather than a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness."
NIGHT TIME IS LOVELYDont you love listening to your favorite songs at night and not sleeping till  5 in the morning,0,"the narrative expresses a sense of enjoyment and appreciation for nighttime activities, specifically listening to favorite songs and staying up late. this behavior can be indicative of a preference for solitude and personal time, but it does not necessarily signify loneliness. the tone is positive and suggests contentment with these late-night habits. individuals who are lonely often express feelings of sadness, isolation, or a desire for social connection, which are not present in this narrative. instead, the narrative highlights a personal choice and a form of self-care or relaxation, rather than a symptom of loneliness. the absence of negative emotions or a longing for companionship supports the classification."
I don't know what to do anymoreAll I ever feel is pain anymore and nothing helps. I don't have anyone left to talk to. Im so fucking desperate to feel anything else that I keep watching fucking romance movies and animes because I'm trying not to feel so empty and defeated. I know I'm fucking pathetic for it but what else am I supposed to do when relationships in general are just not worth it because nobody ever seems to care like I do. Maybe I just care too much. I feel like it has to be my fault because nothing ever goes right. Why am I always the one that gets forgotten? Im tired of living just to live. I don't want to live with so much pain anymore. I keep hoping someone will pull me out if my hole and make me smile for real but hope is useless. How can I expect anyone to want to fix me if I only ever make it worse when I try?,0,"the narrative reflects a profound sense of despair and emotional pain, characterized by expressions of hopelessness and self-deprecation. the individual describes feeling isolated, with no one left to talk to, and resorts to watching romance movies and animes in an attempt to escape their feelings of emptiness. there is a recurring theme of self-blame, as the person questions whether their caring nature is the reason for their perceived failures in relationships. the narrative also highlights a longing for someone to rescue them from their suffering, yet simultaneously expresses a belief that such hope is futile. these elements are indicative of a deep emotional struggle and a sense of being overwhelmed by loneliness, as the individual feels forgotten and incapable of improving their situation."
"People leaving as usual, just wanting to meet some other lonely people. (17) Everyone leaves, anyways I'm 17 and I live in the  U.S. I mostly enjoy games, youtube, politics and circuitry.

I don't have anyone but I'll be available to talk on here.",0,"the narrative suggests a young individual who is open to meeting others with shared interests and is actively seeking social connections. despite mentioning that people leave, the author does not express deep emotional distress or isolation. instead, they highlight their hobbies and openness to different interests, indicating a willingness to engage and form relationships. the tone is matter-of-fact rather than despairing, and the mention of availability to talk suggests an effort to reach out and connect, rather than resigning to solitude. these aspects indicate a proactive approach to socializing rather than signs of profound loneliness."
"Never been in a relationship; Best Friend teasing me about it.Hi! This is my first post, I've been a lurker of reddit for a really long time and I was hoping to get some opinions! Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong place, please let me know if so! 

Let me start off by saying I'm 18 I'm a woman and I'm a virgin, I've never had an actual relationship, I struggle with anxiety, OCD and an ED, all three of which control my life, but I make a huge effort to be friendly and get out there, but at times it seems no one really wants to have anything to do with me... I keep telling myself over and over: ""I just need to get out there, to meet new people, be patient.""
But everyday I feel more and more hopeless. I just want to meet new people and make friends. 

Honestly I had managed to cope with it until recently... I have 1 really close friend, and I hang out with her friend group because I'm lucky enough she includes me, she's my best friend and her friends are nice too.. but lately it seems like all they do is make fun of me for being a virgin. laughing and joking, purposefully asking me what certain sexual acts are to test how 'innocent' I am. I may be a virgin but I'm not stupid...
I know it's just a joke but it's yet another reminder that I'm alone and inadequate, when they start discussing and bragging about sex I feel so alone, I wish I could ask them to just stop the joking but I genuinely fear the confrontation, I don't want to lose them. 

Knowing I'm a virgin makes me feel like I'm less of a woman, like I'm a child, I feel so incompetent, I feel like even if I did have a relationship it wouldn't work because I can't be comfortable with someone, hell I can't even make new friends let alone relationships...

I don't know... part of me needs to know is it possible to meet someone who id actually be comfortable enough with? I'm just so scared to actually meet someone, if in fact anyone would want to meet me... 
Should I try harder to just be more comfortable so I can try and meet people and loose my virginity..? 
I'm so conflicted and I feel awfully pathetic and small, but I'm trying to stay positive, I just honestly want to meet nice new people who I can get to know without feeling pressured and uncomfortable. 

Thank you for taking the time to read it. ",0,"the narrative describes the experiences of an 18-year-old woman who has never been in a relationship and feels teased by her friends for being a virgin. despite her struggles with anxiety, ocd, and an eating disorder, she makes efforts to be friendly and meet new people. she expresses feelings of hopelessness and inadequacy, particularly when her friends joke about her virginity. she fears confrontation and worries about losing her friends, leading to a sense of incompetence and self-doubt. however, the narrative also highlights her close friendship and her inclusion in a friend group, which suggests a support system. her desire to stay positive and meet new people without feeling pressured indicates a proactive approach to overcoming her challenges. these aspects suggest that while she faces significant internal struggles, she is not entirely isolated and has meaningful social connections, which can mitigate feelings of loneliness."
"TrustI??m not really sure if I can do this anymore. Live I mean. I need to know what you talked about with him. I need to know nothing happened. I need to know everything, so that I can properly evaluate my pain because right now it??s running on all cylinders. Even if you do tell me that nothing happened, I won??t believe you. I don??t believe anything that you say or do. How did you portray me to him? I know about the lies you told him but How terrible were the things you said about me? Am I really a bad lover ? Do you really think I don??t listen to you ? When have I been mean to you ? Never have I ever treated you the way you claim. You painted me as a villain to lure him in and it almost worked. Until I caught you. I treated you like an absolute queen. how could you do this to me? I really want to hurt myself over my newfound insecurities . You have to have at least kissed him. It wouldn??t have been so easy to say that you don??t love me and that you??ll wait for him. You must??ve. Or were you that desperate to betray and leave me. 
I??m not good enough and I know that for a fact now. I really don??t want to hurt anymore. Loving you hurts so much. And yet I push through it to see you happy. I know I said that I forgive you to help fix things but I  don??t know how to not make you less mad or upset. It seems like you always are. Sometimes you see through me or I try and speak up about how upset I am but you shut me right up with neglect and frustration as if it??s my fault that you??re uncomfortable handling the truth and the consequences of your actions. I need closure. It doesn??t matter if I get it or not anymore. At this point I??m so lost I just really want to stop existing. 

I feel numb by the end of my shift again. My usual workday i guess, now at least it??s easier to look like I??m okay instead of terribly upset",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of betrayal, emotional pain, and insecurity stemming from a troubled relationship. the author expresses a need for truth and closure, highlighting feelings of distrust and self-doubt. despite the intense emotions and contemplation of self-harm, there is a focus on the specific interpersonal conflict and the perceived wrongdoings of the partner. while the narrative shows significant distress and a desire to understand and cope with the emotional turmoil, it does not necessarily indicate isolation or a lack of social connections beyond this particular relationship. the author's ability to articulate their feelings and the context of their distress suggests that their pain is primarily related to the dynamics of this relationship rather than a broader sense of loneliness."

I'm extremely envious and wish I could be more like him, I only have 2 friends and have never had a girlfriend. No matter how much I try people seem extremely disinterested in me, I give up on trying to be popular or having a girlfriend",0,"the narrative reveals feelings of envy and frustration, primarily focused on social comparisons and perceived social shortcomings. the individual expresses a desire to be more like a peer who is popular and well-liked, and admits to having only two friends and never having had a girlfriend. despite these feelings, the narrative does not delve into deeper emotional isolation or a pervasive sense of loneliness. instead, it centers on the external desire for popularity and romantic success. the mention of giving up on trying to be popular or having a girlfriend suggests resignation rather than profound loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a sense of dissatisfaction with social status and relationships, but lacks the intense emotional depth and internal focus that typically characterize loneliness."
"Do you need someone to talk to? I??m here for you.If you??re feeling lonely, you need to vent, or just someone to talk to, I??m here for you. Hit me up anytime.

Just looking for someone to talk tooJust want to talk it??s pretty simple.,0,"the narrative expresses a desire for conversation but lacks deeper emotional cues or expressions of distress that are typically associated with loneliness. the phrasing ""just looking for someone to talk to"" and ""just want to talk"" suggests a straightforward need for social interaction rather than an underlying sense of isolation. this kind of casual, uncomplicated request for communication is more indicative of someone seeking social engagement rather than someone who is experiencing the emotional pain and longing that often accompany loneliness. the simplicity and directness of the language used do not convey the complexity or intensity of feelings that are common in narratives of lonely individuals. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the typical signs of loneliness."
It??s feeling SO tempting to just go back to the person I used to be with for a bit of love right now.

"Don't know what it feels like to be lovedI think the dogs I see a lot ""love"" me but I imagine it's not the same as love from a human. If I stopped playing with them they'd probably never look at me. 22 years on this planet and not a single genuine reciprocation. I have done so much for so many people, only to have them leave just as quick as they came. It's pretty miserable to live like this.

I can't even believe I've made it this long feeling like this.",0,"the narrative describes a profound sense of isolation and longing for human connection. the individual expresses feelings of being unloved and unappreciated despite their efforts to engage with others. the comparison of the affection from dogs to human love underscores their yearning for genuine, reciprocal relationships. the mention of writing a suicide note and the struggle with suicidal thoughts highlights the depth of their despair. despite attempts to improve their situation, such as losing weight, learning guitar, and stepping out of their comfort zone, the individual remains trapped in a cycle of sadness and loneliness. these elements collectively depict a person grappling with intense loneliness and a desperate hope for change, which is crucial for understanding their emotional state."
HeyAnyone wanna chat?,0,"the narrative suggests a casual and open-ended invitation for conversation, which typically indicates a desire for social interaction rather than an expression of loneliness. the use of informal language and the lack of specific emotional content suggest that the individual is not necessarily experiencing distress or isolation. instead, it appears to be a simple and spontaneous attempt to engage with others, which is a common behavior in socially active individuals. there is no mention of feelings of emptiness, sadness, or desperation, which are often associated with loneliness. the brevity and straightforwardness of the message further imply that the individual is comfortable reaching out and likely has other social interactions or outlets available."

I dont know where to turn anymore.[deleted],0,"the narrative reflects a sense of confusion and uncertainty, but it lacks specific indicators of loneliness. typically, loneliness narratives include explicit mentions of isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being misunderstood or disconnected from others. in this case, the brief statement ""i don't know where to turn anymore"" suggests a general sense of being lost or overwhelmed, which can stem from various life stressors unrelated to loneliness. without further context or details about relationships, social interactions, or feelings of isolation, it's challenging to attribute this narrative to loneliness. instead, it seems more indicative of someone experiencing a temporary crisis or seeking direction in their life."

P. S. Thank you for having such a wonderful community in this subreddit ????",0,"the narrative showcases an individual who is actively seeking social interaction and connection through voice calls, indicating a proactive approach to building relationships. the person expresses a willingness to engage in polite and respectful conversation on a variety of topics, demonstrating an openness to social engagement rather than isolation. they also show an understanding of boundaries and limitations, such as not being an expert in mental health, which suggests a level of self-awareness and responsibility. the tone is friendly and inviting, with expressions of gratitude towards the community, further indicating a sense of belonging and appreciation. these aspects collectively suggest that the individual is not experiencing loneliness, as they are taking steps to connect with others and seem to have a positive outlook on social interactions."
"Even though im super lonely I feel like im starting to not care as muchI haven't hanged out with anyone in like 2 months, in pretty sure all my friends hate me at this point, but it doesn't really bother me anymore. Im just focusing on things I like and work and eventually I'll move away and find people who actually care about me and make me feel happy. It kinda feels good to remove toxic relationships from your life because you start focusing on other that matters more.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of acceptance and positive coping mechanisms that suggest the individual is not currently experiencing loneliness. the person acknowledges their lack of social interaction and the potential loss of friends but does not express distress or sadness about it. instead, they focus on personal growth and self-improvement, which are signs of resilience and emotional stability. the intention to move away and find more meaningful relationships indicates a proactive approach to their social life rather than a feeling of helplessness or isolation. the mention of feeling good about removing toxic relationships further supports the idea that the individual is prioritizing their well-being and not dwelling on loneliness. overall, the narrative shows a constructive and forward-looking mindset, which is not typical of someone who is lonely."
"I miss my ex girlfriendI really miss her. She was so amazing, in every way. Just being with them made me so happy. They were the only one that made actually feel, happy. Then, they just stopped talking, they wanted to be left alone, then eventually they just stopped interacting with me at all. 

I really miss them. Without them I just feel alone, like I have no one else. I fucking miss them so much. Without them, life doesn??t seem as good as I thought it would be. 

So yeah, that??s it.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of longing and sadness over the loss of a significant relationship, which is a common human experience following a breakup. the individual reminisces about the happiness their ex-girlfriend brought into their life and the emptiness felt after the relationship ended. while the narrative is filled with emotions of missing the ex-girlfriend and feeling alone, these feelings are typical responses to the end of a meaningful relationship rather than indicators of chronic loneliness. the focus is on the specific loss of one person rather than a pervasive sense of social isolation or lack of meaningful connections in general. the intensity of the emotions described reflects the pain of the breakup rather than an ongoing state of loneliness."
"Touch starvedHow to deal with touch starvation? I??ve never been more alone in my life. I crave touch by anyone. Sometimes I would also just randomly brush up against people in supermarkets or other similar situations. Can??t do that even with covid. There is so much bottled inside me right now. I just wish I could cry in peace for an hour or so. I have no privacy since I had to move back with parents, thanks covid. I get my first car tomorrow, hoping I could cry in there.",0,"the narrative describes a person experiencing significant emotional distress and a strong desire for physical touch, which are common indicators of loneliness. the mention of craving touch and brushing up against people in public places suggests a deep need for physical connection. the feeling of having no privacy and wanting to cry alone also highlights a sense of isolation and lack of personal space. despite these indicators, the individual shows some signs of coping and forward-thinking, such as looking forward to having a car for private moments. this forward-looking attitude and the presence of family support, even if not entirely fulfilling, suggest that the person may have some emotional and social resources to draw upon, which can mitigate the feelings of loneliness to some extent."
I wish I never found out what it was like to not be lonely.[removed],0,"the narrative expresses a longing for a time when the individual was not aware of loneliness, suggesting a past experience of connection and fulfillment. this implies that the person currently feels a sense of loss or nostalgia but not necessarily loneliness. the phrase ""i wish i never found out"" indicates a preference for ignorance over the pain of comparison, but it doesn't inherently reflect ongoing loneliness. rather, it reflects a cognitive dissonance where the individual is grappling with their past experiences versus their current state. the absence of explicit expressions of isolation, lack of social connections, or feelings of emptiness supports the notion that the person may be experiencing a complex emotional state rather than loneliness itself."
anyone willing to give me a quick therapy session?im fucked,0,"the narrative suggests a person in distress, possibly experiencing acute stress or a crisis, but not necessarily loneliness. the use of explicit language and the urgent request for a ""quick therapy session"" indicates a need for immediate help, which can stem from various sources such as a recent traumatic event, overwhelming emotions, or a specific problem that needs addressing. however, there is no mention of feelings of isolation, disconnection from others, or a lack of meaningful relationships, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, the direct call for therapy implies the person recognizes the need for professional support, which can be a sign of self-awareness and an understanding that their current state is temporary and situational rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
I starting to dislike people more often.Ironic,0,"the narrative reflects a growing sense of frustration and disconnection from others, which might initially seem like an indicator of loneliness. however, the expression of dislike towards people can often be a sign of social withdrawal or irritability rather than loneliness. individuals who are lonely typically express a longing for connection and a sense of isolation, whereas this narrative suggests a defensive stance against social interactions. the use of the word ""ironic"" might imply a self-awareness or realization that their feelings are contradictory, but it does not necessarily indicate a desire for social engagement. overall, the narrative lacks the typical indicators of loneliness such as feelings of sadness, longing for companionship, or expressions of emotional pain related to isolation. instead, it points more towards a potential disengagement or disinterest in social relationships."
friendsI just think things would be better if i had friends (irl friends ) i get sad when i see people having fun with their friends .i legit have no friends in my colony ihave been living here for like 9 years like damn shits depressing but its okay ig i will have fun by myself,0,"the narrative reflects a desire for companionship and some feelings of sadness when observing others with friends, but it also shows a level of acceptance and self-reliance. the individual acknowledges the lack of friends and expresses some disappointment, yet they do not exhibit profound despair or a pervasive sense of isolation. instead, they mention having fun by themselves, which indicates an ability to find contentment and enjoyment independently. this resilience and self-sufficiency are not typical indicators of loneliness, as they suggest that the individual is managing their social situation without significant emotional distress."
I??ll never have anyone[removed],0,"the narrative suggests a sense of finality and resignation with the phrase ""i'll never have anyone."" however, it is important to consider the context and tone. while the statement might initially appear indicative of loneliness, it lacks the depth and detail typically associated with someone experiencing profound loneliness. often, individuals who are lonely provide more context about their feelings, such as describing specific situations of isolation, emotional pain, or a yearning for connection. the brevity and lack of elaboration in this narrative may imply a momentary feeling of frustration or a hyperbolic expression rather than a chronic state of loneliness. thus, the narrative does not exhibit the common indicators of loneliness such as detailed emotional distress or a persistent sense of isolation."
"i cant make friends without feeling influenced/influencing, and hurt/hurtful.i just seem to hurt people by nature of interacting, making them question t hemselves, trying to get them to agree with what i think or just simply having a tendency to provoke and debate.   most people dont want that, they just want to chill.  and sometimes i just want to chill too.   but how can i chill with people that dont agree with everything i believe in.   how can they chill with me if i dont believe in some of the fundamental things they do.     


im so easily hurt sometimes, and sometimes im so cold and callous that i ddont realize how im being hurtful, and when i do, its too late, and the damage is done, and nothing matters because that attempt at a relationship has failed.    


i tend to start viewing myself as too intellectual and ""above it"" in such a superior way that i dont realize the whole, poetically speaking, seeming thing of ""as above so below"" because by being above it, im also not able to just be in the moment and enjoy things (seems to be the same sort of thing as class divides, street smarts vs book smarts, all that jazz).    


so like, im fucking alone, and everyone is better off for it, except not at all.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is grappling with interpersonal conflicts and self-perception issues, rather than experiencing loneliness per se. the person describes difficulties in forming friendships due to a tendency to provoke debates and influence others, which leads to hurt feelings and misunderstandings. they express a desire to connect and ""chill"" with others but struggle with aligning beliefs and behaviors. the narrative also reveals a self-critical view, where the individual sees themselves as intellectually superior yet emotionally disconnected. while these challenges indicate social friction and self-isolation, they do not necessarily equate to loneliness. instead, the focus is on the complexity of social interactions and the internal conflict between intellectualism and emotional connection. this nuanced self-awareness and the recognition of social dynamics suggest a person who is introspective and self-reflective, rather than someone who is simply lonely."
I just want/need a hugI've been out of my home country for 3 years for university and i am yet to meet someone or make any friend. Im always alone doing everything on my own. I feel suicidal every couple of days just wanting to end how i feel. it sucks it really hurts and pains me. I wish i was normal and didn't have social anxiety so i can just meet someone. i've tried bumble to find friends but my social anxiety is stopping me from swiping. i just want to be normal.,0,"the narrative describes an individual who has been away from their home country for three years, struggling with social anxiety and the inability to make friends. the person expresses a deep desire for connection and normalcy, highlighting feelings of isolation and pain. they mention trying to use social apps like bumble to find friends but are hindered by their anxiety. the recurring mention of feeling suicidal and the longing for a hug underscores a profound sense of distress and loneliness. these elements are strong indicators of loneliness, as the person is experiencing emotional pain, a lack of social connections, and a desire for companionship."
"Always been avoidedAll my life people have avoided me. Never wanted to be in a group with me, never wanted to sit by me and never wanted to talk to me. I??ve never even talked to a girl. I just want to be loved. I crave the physical touch, the love and I just can??t get it. Every time I approach a girl the seem cold towards me like I??m a burden. And my final prom I won??t be going because nobody has wanted to go with me. I??m not going to pay to be there watching everybody Dance and hold their date. Honesty at this point I??m wanted by nobody . Family stopped caring about me when I moved out and didn??t really care while I was there. So maybe tonight I??ll end it all.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of social isolation and yearning for connection. the individual describes a consistent pattern of being avoided and rejected by others, highlighting experiences of not being included in groups, not having meaningful interactions, and feeling like a burden when approaching others. the craving for physical touch and love, combined with the absence of these experiences, further underscores the individual's emotional distress. the mention of not attending prom due to the lack of a date and the decision to avoid watching others engage in social activities exemplifies the pain of exclusion. additionally, the sense of abandonment by family members after moving out, and the feeling that they didn't care even before, contributes to the individual's perception of being unwanted and unloved. the narrative concludes with a mention of contemplating ending their life, which is a significant indicator of severe emotional turmoil and hopelessness. overall, the narrative is characterized by themes of rejection, longing for connection, and profound emotional pain."
"(M23) Is it normal to feel this way?I randomly messaged a girl on facebook. We hung out once or twice through a mutual friend years ago. She was slow to respond but seemed enthusiastic including smiling and blushing emojis. I then said I knew I messaged her out of the blue, but thought she was cool and wanted to know if she wanted to get coffee/food sometime to which she surprisigly said yes. She told me she would let me know what her schedule was a week ago and never messaged me back. Now I have this all too familiar feeling that she lost interest. I'm tired of being ghosted and just left behind. She could sincerly be busy as she's told me before. I feel like this goes back to similar things happening. I just want to have a connection with someone and it's getting depressing waiting for it.",0,"the narrative reveals a person who is experiencing frustration and disappointment due to a lack of consistent communication from someone they reached out to. they express a desire for connection and feel discouraged by past experiences of being ""ghosted"" or left behind. however, the narrative lacks deeper signs of pervasive loneliness, such as prolonged isolation, feelings of worthlessness, or a profound sense of disconnection from others. instead, it reflects a situational frustration with specific social interactions rather than a broader, ongoing struggle with loneliness. the individual's hopefulness and proactive attempts to form connections suggest they are not deeply entrenched in loneliness but are rather navigating common social challenges."
"If you wanna suicide, read thisyeah  my father is son of a bitch and cheats my mom and my mom can't divorce  with him because in my fucking country  the girls have lower education  option so my mom didn't go any college or something and married when she  was 17, she only knows house stuff like cooking , looking after babies  etc. i've been in this situation in my whole life. i haven't even a bed  to sleep on until 10 , and i was sleeping on the ground before that. i  thought about suicide countless times, probably started when i was like  8.

but despite all of that, i  didn't  suicide as you can see, so why?  i born in this fucking  situation, and lived horrible years but i saw beatiful lives in movies,  among friends etc. so that basically means a good life is possible. so  if i suicide, what will happen? my mom will cry and probably die because  she is so sad, my brother will also have a really big trauma and i will  be forgotten from this fucking universe. sounds like fun ? nope.

so  what i do? i am trying my best to be happy. fuck money, fuck reputation  etc. i only seek happiness in this life, and now i can say i am happy.  because i have some dreams and i am working really hard to achieve them.   but i am not gonna be happy when i achieve them, i am happy now,  trying to do them. the thing is , if you wanna be happy, just find a  dream and work hard for it, but enjoy the process , that's the actual  happiness. reaching the goal is not that important.

note: i don't really care about your 'oh that sucks, i feel sad for you' comments. i just wanna say, there are people who had terrible lives but also they've done cool stuff. so instead of suicide and be forgotten from the universe, try to became immortal via working on cool stuff .crave your names in this fucking planet. that's what i'll do.",0,"the narrative reveals a turbulent and challenging upbringing, marked by significant family issues and a lack of material comforts. despite these hardships, the author expresses a strong sense of resilience and determination. the individual acknowledges the pain and suffering they have experienced but emphasizes their pursuit of happiness and personal dreams. they reject the idea of suicide, not only because of the impact it would have on their loved ones but also because they see potential for a better life. this focus on finding joy in the process of working towards goals, rather than the goals themselves, indicates a mindset oriented towards growth and self-improvement. the narrative also dismisses pity from others, suggesting a level of self-reliance and internal motivation. these aspects collectively suggest that the author is not currently experiencing loneliness, as they demonstrate a proactive approach to life, a sense of purpose, and an ability to find satisfaction in their journey."
"UnworthyI'm new here but just reading people's post, I feel welcomed. I've been struggling to find myself and I might be the only one, but does anyone ruin any chance of a relationship they get? Friends, family, or even love, I pushed it all away but I long for it. I beg and crave for it like an addiction. I unreligiously pray for anyone out there to tilt the scale of luck in my favor. But, when I hit the darkest point of my day/night. I throw all my hard work away. I feel angry, frustrated, and no matter how cliche it sounds, I feel like turning to a monster. All my past relationships I've been told I'll find better. But the truth was I only wanted someone to stay, to be with me when I needed them most. At first I would blame myself, but thinking back I never did wrong. I always placed them above myself and here I am watching them grow happy after being used. The sponge that I became, absorbed their dark consciousness and became their light. Once they grew, they abandoned me, some even cheated. Don't they know that morally breaks me? Am I even worth it?",0,"the narrative reflects a deep struggle with self-worth and the aftermath of failed relationships, yet it also contains elements that indicate a sense of connection and community. the individual expresses feeling welcomed by reading others' posts, which suggests a sense of belonging and shared experience. despite the intense emotions of anger, frustration, and feelings of being used, the person shows an awareness of their own efforts to connect and support others. this awareness and the ability to articulate their feelings indicate a level of self-reflection and resilience. the narrative also highlights the individual's longing for meaningful relationships and their continuous effort to find them, which can be seen as a sign of hope and determination rather than complete isolation. the person's engagement with a community, even if just online, and their desire to improve their situation suggest that they are not entirely consumed by loneliness. they are actively seeking connection and understanding, which are positive steps toward overcoming their struggles."
"People don't like my on my main account and I'm very lonelyPlease talk to me, I'm so lonely.  On my main reddit account, people keep making fun of me and saying negative stuff to me.  I'm so lonely!!!!!  Why don't people like me on my main account?  They said that I'm nothing but a nuisance if you look at my reddit post history.  But I just want to be a good person!!",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of social rejection and a plea for connection, which might typically suggest loneliness. the individual describes negative interactions on their main reddit account, where they feel ridiculed and labeled as a nuisance. their repeated declarations of loneliness and desire for acceptance indicate a struggle with social validation. however, despite these expressions, the narrative might be classified as non-lonely due to potential exaggeration or a focus on online interactions rather than a broader context of their life. it is possible that the individual's offline relationships or other aspects of their life provide sufficient social support, mitigating the impact of their online experiences. additionally, the intense focus on the specific context of reddit interactions may not fully capture their overall social well-being."
"AdviceIf you who are reading this and you like someone, go after that person, I didn't go after the person I loved and because of that she dates someone else, maybe if I wasn't so afraid to tell her what I felt , she would still be with me, so don't make the same mistake as me, go after the person you love, go now or this can be your last chance.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of regret and missed opportunity rather than loneliness. the individual is offering advice based on their personal experience of not pursuing someone they loved. the focus is on encouraging others to take action in their relationships to avoid similar regrets. there is no indication of ongoing feelings of isolation or a lack of social connections. instead, the narrative emphasizes proactive behavior and learning from past mistakes. the advice given suggests that the person is concerned with helping others avoid the same pitfalls, which indicates a level of social awareness and connection. this perspective aligns more with someone who is reflective and wants to make a positive impact on others rather than someone who is experiencing loneliness."
"There's nothing I want more than to find love, but it seems so distant and alien, like it's not meant for meI legitimately can't imagine someone being in love with me. It just seems completely foreign.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep longing for love and a sense of alienation from it, yet it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual reflects on their desire for love and the difficulty in imagining it happening to them, which could stem from low self-esteem or a lack of confidence rather than loneliness. the focus on love being distant and foreign suggests a specific emotional barrier rather than a broader sense of social isolation. while the yearning for connection is evident, the absence of explicit mentions of feeling isolated or disconnected from others supports the classification. the narrative centers more on personal perceptions of love and self-worth, which are distinct from the broader, pervasive experience of loneliness."

Love to make people laugh. Been alone for 2 n a half years now.  Finding it hard to find a gorl/woman with like interests.  Just wanna make someone happy n have that feeling reciprocated ????",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who, despite experiencing some challenges in finding companionship, demonstrates a proactive and open-minded approach to connecting with others. the mention of enjoying various hobbies such as video games, magic the gathering, movies, comics, and d&d suggests a person with diverse interests and passions. the individual expresses a desire to make others laugh and be happy, indicating a positive and outgoing personality. while there is an acknowledgment of being alone for two and a half years, the focus remains on finding someone with shared interests rather than expressing deep feelings of loneliness. the narrative shows a person who is actively seeking companionship and maintaining a hopeful outlook, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
Loneliness has no chill sometimesthats all,0,"the narrative reflects a casual and somewhat humorous tone, suggesting a more lighthearted approach to the concept of loneliness. the phrase ""loneliness has no chill"" uses modern slang, which often indicates a sense of relatability and a lack of severe emotional distress. the brevity of the statement, along with the informal language, implies that the author might not be deeply affected by loneliness but rather is making an offhand comment about it. this kind of narrative is less likely to be associated with the deeper, more pervasive feelings of isolation and sadness that typically characterize true loneliness."
"It's kinda weird..I feel when I try to reach out to someone who says they just want someone to talk to or a friend, I get ghosted.

Like conversation goes well for a day to like few days. I always respond in a reasonable amount of time. 

It's almost like they are either just bored or like being lonely.

Or my last theory, hoping it's not true is that's its just me.",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social connections and experiencing some challenges in maintaining them. however, the person is engaging in conversations and reaching out to others, indicating an effort to connect and communicate. the individual's awareness of the situation and consideration of different explanations, including the possibility that others might be bored or prefer solitude, suggests a level of introspection and understanding. while there is a mention of being ghosted, the overall tone does not convey a deep sense of isolation or distress typically associated with loneliness. instead, it shows a proactive approach to social interaction and a rational analysis of the circumstances, which are not strong indicators of loneliness."
"Every friend group I join I change the ""air"" in the group to awkward silences.What I mean by this is I have some old friends and when I visit them and meet with his friends I mean join them first time I always create awkward silences. Even though I do nothing, nobody is speaking and checking their phones awkwardly",0,"the narrative describes an individual's perception of causing awkward silences in social settings, particularly when joining new friend groups. this experience can be distressing, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the individual has old friends and is actively engaging in social interactions, which suggests they have a social network and are not isolated. the focus on creating awkward silences and the discomfort it causes may point to social anxiety or self-consciousness rather than loneliness. individuals experiencing loneliness often report feelings of isolation, lack of meaningful connections, or a desire for companionship that is not being fulfilled. in this case, the concern is more about social dynamics and fitting in, rather than an absence of social connections or emotional support."
"Getting compliments but nothing really happens...This is my first time posting on this sub, not even sure if this is a vent or not .

It somewhat infuriates me when people compliment me but I know it's lies. An example is when my mother keeps saying ""your so handsome!"". She's my mother and she loves me more than she can express but still, Imagine being called handsome but no other woman takes interest in you!

Another one is when I was working at a zoo this summer and after helping people, some of them would say ""your going to be a great dad!"". I had to smile to be nice but, inside I asked myself ""well how come I haven't gotten in a relationship yet?"". Don't get me wrong I appreciate their compliments because I know they meant it but still.",0,"the narrative reveals a person who is grappling with self-doubt and frustration despite receiving positive feedback from others. while they express skepticism about the sincerity of the compliments, the underlying issue seems to be a lack of self-confidence rather than loneliness. the individual acknowledges the love and appreciation from their mother and strangers, which suggests they are not isolated or lacking social connections. instead, their struggle appears to be more about reconciling external validation with their internal feelings of inadequacy. the desire for romantic validation and questioning why they haven't been in a relationship points to a specific area of personal concern, but it does not necessarily indicate a broader sense of loneliness. overall, the narrative highlights issues of self-esteem and unmet expectations rather than a profound sense of social isolation."
"I'm sorry in advanceI'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit for me but I really feel like I just needed to express the way I feel and this is the first one that popped into my head.

I'm not lonely in the sense of not having friends or family that care, that's why I'm not sure if this subreddit applies to me. But I do feel lonely, it's a long story and knowing me I'll use a lot of unnecessary detail so I'm sorry.

I've always felt sad, apparently I even wanted to drown myself when I was like 7, I still wouldn't say I'm depressed tho because I have a lot of good moments. But I think about 2 years ago I fell for this girl, I'm gonna be calling her deodorant as I don't wanna use an actual name. I literally became obsessed with her. I ended up becoming friends with her and eventually my other friends pushed me to tell her how I felt. She didn't feel the same way, about a year goes by and I steel have the same feelings for her and I end up finding out she did like me back but she lied because she was scared she would hurt me, this ended up making me very sad and confused for a while and another year later I met this other girl online, fell in love and we became a thing. Even though she lived in a different country and we'd never met in person everything seemed perfect, but sometimes I'd get these feelings for doedorant coming back as I'm still friends with her and I'm not one to let go of people i care about. My gf ends up breaking up with me and since I knew my best friend was on a date and I didn't wanna ruin it for him I turned to deodorant and she has really helped me get through everything including several anxiety attacks extremely well, sadly this also rekindled my feelings for her and it consumed me as I didn't know what to do because I didn't wanna ruin our friendship, after keeping it in for a while I told her and got the answer I expected. now I just feel like I can't or maybe even don't deserve to be loved.
On top of all that we now have no school for 3 weeks because of Corona which means more alone time which usually isn't good.

If you did read all this thank you and I'm sorry.",0,"the narrative reflects a complex emotional state where the individual expresses feelings of sadness, confusion, and unrequited love. despite these emotions, the person mentions having friends and family who care about them, and they also experience good moments in their life, indicating that their overall social support system is intact. the narrative includes specific instances of reaching out to friends for support during difficult times, such as when their girlfriend broke up with them. these actions suggest that the individual is capable of maintaining meaningful connections and seeking help when needed, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the ongoing interaction with friends and the ability to form new relationships, even if they don't always work out as hoped, further support the notion that the individual is not experiencing loneliness in a clinical sense. the mention of rekindled feelings for ""deodorant"" and the subsequent disappointment are more indicative of situational sadness rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness."
Invitations[removed],0,"the narrative suggests that the individual is actively engaged in social activities and maintains a network of connections. the mention of receiving invitations indicates that others seek their presence and company, which is a strong indicator of social integration and acceptance. this sense of being included and wanted by others typically mitigates feelings of loneliness. furthermore, the absence of language expressing isolation, sadness, or a desire for more meaningful interactions supports the notion that the person is not experiencing loneliness. instead, they appear to have adequate social support and opportunities for interaction, which are crucial factors in maintaining emotional well-being and preventing loneliness."

I have sc, wa and discord but we can also just talk on here ^_^",0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction and companionship following a breakup, but it does not necessarily reflect deeper feelings of loneliness. the individual expresses a specific need to find someone to talk to and share light-hearted moments like memes and laughter, suggesting a proactive approach to maintaining social connections. the emphasis on wanting to interact with someone younger than 25 and the openness to various communication platforms demonstrate an effort to seek out new social opportunities rather than a sense of isolation. while the breakup might be a source of emotional distress, the person's response shows resilience and an active pursuit of social engagement, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."

No one understands what it??s like to have no expectations of finding love.

No one understands why I feel defective

No one understands what it??s like to be me",0,"the narrative reflects deep emotional distress and a sense of isolation, but it lacks specific indicators that would typically be associated with loneliness as a chronic state. the writer expresses feelings of being misunderstood and a yearning for love, which are common emotional experiences. however, these sentiments alone do not conclusively point to a pervasive sense of loneliness. the absence of detailed context about social interactions, the duration of these feelings, or specific instances of social withdrawal means that while the writer is clearly in pain, it does not necessarily indicate that they are experiencing loneliness as defined by a consistent lack of social connection or support. the emphasis on being misunderstood and feeling defective suggests more about self-perception and emotional turmoil rather than a clear state of loneliness."
Another lonely Christmas and New Year approaching??.. againI never imagined that i would still be single at 45. The holidays really suck for me. Mom and dad have no holiday spirit and my brother and sister have their own families. Being single I put all my energy into making others feel loved at Christmas. For once I wish someone would do the same for me. Every year I tell myself I??ve excepted it but come December 1st and the feelings come back.,0,"the narrative reflects a sense of resignation and disappointment about spending the holidays alone, highlighting the author's single status at 45. the individual mentions the lack of holiday spirit in their family and the focus on their siblings' families, which could suggest feelings of exclusion. however, the author's proactive approach in making others feel loved during christmas indicates a level of social engagement and emotional investment in others. the wish for reciprocal affection and the annual resurgence of these feelings suggest an awareness of their emotional state but do not necessarily imply deep-seated loneliness. instead, it shows a momentary struggle with holiday-induced melancholy rather than a pervasive sense of isolation."
"Have you everbeen to the point where you??re going through the motions, as if you??re someone else. I??m not sure where this belongs maybe here because I??m feeling lonely, maybe no one reads it and it??s at the bottom of the barrel. I??ve always been an outgoing, socialist person, never questioned who was around me so long as we got along, never cared for what you looked like, as long as we had a level of real in between, I hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend, job to job, always searching a piece of happiness, going around lost searching for some unknown answer. Everyone around me seems to be on a level of something I can??t obtain, sure I own a business, my daughter now lives with me, but I am not happy. Or some days I am, the most part is I find myself getting up on the weekend really early and just driving, I??ve driven two states non stop just on the road feeling everything. One time I drove 350 miles to catch the ocean, just myself and tunes I could sing and relate to. I deleted all my ??social?? media awhile ago, Facebook and Instagram and whatever else I had, then about a few weeks later I realized no one checked up on me, not one call or text, I figured ??don??t ask questions you don??t want the answer to??, because I knew right away no one would. But some part of me hoped someone would. I walked into a life again, with a seldom and sobering feeling that this ??feeling?? I??m feeling, whatever you want to describe it as, was sentimental. I find myself beginning to love who I am, and damn it be a lonely Ss road, but worth it. I find myself carrying myself, telling myself I??m worth it, I??m this and that. I??m enough for anyone. It no one sees then I know I got me. Gods got my back. For those who are just down right lonely, searching, wondering, you got everything you will ever need inside of you. I know depression hurts, men and women, i know heartache and finical problems drain your souls. I know it all hurts, there??s a million people just like us, and a million more that are going through a lot more too. We??re all family, we just forgot how to love. Maybe that??s what we all need to become is the love we want to see. I hope you all are feeling better today or someday, I really do

Go to BED!!!This is mainly telling myself to go to bed....    but my mind doesn??t let that happen because I??m starting to think I??m too lonely and need to try to  get back out there and try to find someone that??ll hold me and tell me I??m pretty cause damn it??s been to long.,0,"the narrative reflects an individual struggling with sleep due to intrusive thoughts about loneliness and the desire for companionship. however, the tone and content suggest a proactive mindset, where the person is aware of their feelings and is considering taking steps to address them by seeking social interactions. the mention of wanting to ""get back out there"" and find someone indicates a level of self-awareness and motivation that is less typical of severe loneliness, where individuals often feel helpless or resigned. this proactive approach and the specific goal of finding someone to provide emotional support are indicators that the person is not deeply entrenched in loneliness but rather experiencing a temporary sense of solitude that they are ready to overcome."
"I just want to be the reason a woman is happy...Why don't any of them want me to be their guy. They'll always have this warm, wholesome smile for other men but not me...",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for connection and validation from women, but the underlying sentiment does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the author expresses frustration and confusion about why they are not chosen by women, which could be interpreted as a struggle with self-worth or social acceptance rather than a deeper sense of isolation. the mention of observing women's warm smiles for other men suggests the author is actively engaging in social environments where they witness these interactions, implying they are not completely isolated. the focus on wanting to make a woman happy points to a specific goal or expectation rather than a pervasive feeling of being alone. while the narrative contains elements of social frustration, it lacks the depth of emotional pain and pervasive sense of disconnection typically associated with loneliness."
"Anybody wanna talk?I've been looking for people to talk to, and while I have a few friends to talk to, maybe 2 or 3, I just want enough friends so that I can talk instead of being left alone to my thoughts",0,"the narrative suggests a desire for social interaction and mentions having a few friends to talk to, indicating that the individual does have some social connections. the phrase ""maybe 2 or 3"" implies that the person is not completely isolated and has established relationships, which can provide emotional support. the desire to have more friends to avoid being left alone to their thoughts is a common social need, but it does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the presence of existing friendships and the proactive approach to seeking more interactions are typical behaviors of someone who values social engagement but is not necessarily experiencing loneliness."
"Reminder: Do not post your social medias or phone numbers on this subreddit.This includes, but is not limited to, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Discord and Facebook. Posts and comments containing any of these will be removed and may result in a temporary ban.",0,"the narrative is a straightforward reminder about community guidelines on a subreddit, emphasizing the importance of not sharing personal contact information like social media handles or phone numbers. this type of message is typically administrative and focuses on maintaining the safety and privacy of the community members. there is no personal or emotional content that suggests the author's state of mind or feelings. the tone is neutral and authoritative, aimed at informing and ensuring compliance with the rules rather than expressing personal experiences or emotions. such a narrative lacks the introspective or emotional depth that would indicate feelings of loneliness, as it is purely functional and devoid of personal context or sentiment."
What are the chances you approach someone and they want to be friends?It's especially hard if they already have friends. Is it even possible to fit into someone else's friend group? How do you get someone interested in being your friend?,0,"the narrative reflects a curiosity and contemplation about forming new friendships and integrating into existing social groups. while the questions posed might suggest some level of social uncertainty, they do not necessarily indicate loneliness. instead, they reflect a common experience of wondering about social dynamics and the process of making new friends. the author seems to be seeking advice or understanding about social interactions rather than expressing feelings of isolation or emotional distress. the focus is on the practical aspects of friendship rather than an emotional plea for connection, which is a key indicator that the individual is not experiencing loneliness."
"I (32 M) lot guilt and angry due to my ex (39 F).Guilt:
I have a lot of guilt. We worked in the same building. And I feel she may have not wanted to call it off sooner. But didn??t because of that. She did end up going to a different building farther away from home and her kids. I also feel guilty about that.

If she would have wanted to call it off. But did not want to work in the same place. I would have gladly quit. If she talked to me. And I feel like I made her wasted her time.

Anger:
But I also was a lot of angry. At what point did you want to call it off. Why would you let me meet you kids. Why would ask me to go on vacation with you and your sons. I got super attached to her youngest son. And I feel like she wait till my birthday to break up with me on purpose. And she wouldn??t talk to me at all.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of guilt and anger stemming from a breakup. the individual is grappling with feelings of responsibility for the ex-partner's job relocation and the emotional turmoil of the relationship's end. however, these emotions, while intense, are directed towards specific events and interactions within the relationship rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the focus is on the specific grievances and the perceived injustices within the relationship, such as the timing of the breakup and the involvement with the ex-partner's children. these aspects suggest a preoccupation with the breakup itself rather than a broader feeling of social isolation or lack of connection. the narrative does not indicate a lack of social support or an overarching feeling of being alone, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a situational emotional response to a difficult personal experience."

"I wish I had people to talk to about my interestsSo I??m 17 years old and I??m a furry, and I can??t seem to really find anyone to talk to.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social connection and finding like-minded individuals to discuss personal interests, which is a common experience for many people, especially teenagers exploring unique hobbies or identities. while the individual expresses difficulty in finding others to share their passion for being a furry, this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. it is more indicative of a challenge in finding a specific social group rather than a lack of overall social interaction or support. the absence of broader themes of isolation, emotional distress, or a lack of meaningful relationships suggests that the person may have other social connections but is seeking a more niche community."
"Just wanting to vent. Feeling low.I knew I would be living a differently lifestyle than my family and  based on their reactions towards me, it wouldn't be an easy road that I would be taking. I was stuck with my blood relatives because I was too scared to call child services. But now, through Instagram, I see them all happy as though I never existed. I always felt that way with them, like I didn't belong and they could care less if I existed. It really hurts that's I can't share that happiness with them or have that happiness right now in my life. Love yourself and you will never be alone, words I've recently took comfort in. And I know the cause for my loneliness and I know the symptoms of loneliness, I know all of this and I haven't told them, haven't explained. But they also haven't seen the signs and haven't spoken to me since I cut my abusive mother's out of my life. It still hurts that the people that said they would love me forever, couldn't and wouldn't keep their word. Everyone leaves. Because people are rivers, always flowing-always changing. I hope one day I change my mentality and I'll find my community. Find my happiness.",0,"the narrative expresses feelings of exclusion and emotional pain stemming from strained familial relationships. the individual recounts experiences of not belonging and perceives a lack of care from their family, which is highlighted by their observations on social media. despite these challenges, the person demonstrates self-awareness and a desire for personal growth. they mention taking comfort in the idea of self-love and understanding the causes and symptoms of their emotional state. there is a hopeful tone towards the end, indicating a belief in the possibility of finding a supportive community and happiness in the future. the narrative shows resilience and a forward-looking perspective, which are not typically associated with chronic loneliness."

Single mum, deep thinker, compassionate af, and would love to chat",0,"the narrative reflects a person who, despite facing challenges, exhibits traits of resilience and social engagement. the mention of being ""youthful, fun, crazy"" suggests a generally positive and active personality. describing oneself as a ""single mum"" and ""deep thinker"" indicates a level of self-awareness and responsibility, which often involve being occupied with various activities and thoughts. the desire to chat and the use of ""compassionate af"" further emphasize a willingness to connect and communicate with others. these aspects suggest a person who, while experiencing a difficult period, maintains a proactive approach to social interactions and self-expression, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
Do you remember how to have fun ![deleted],0,"the narrative suggests a query about remembering how to have fun, which might imply a light-hearted or nostalgic tone rather than one of loneliness. the absence of detailed expressions of isolation, longing for social connection, or feelings of emptiness points towards a non-lonely state. typically, individuals experiencing loneliness might discuss their lack of meaningful interactions, their feelings of being disconnected from others, or their emotional struggles. in contrast, this narrative lacks such indicators and instead hints at a possible playful or reflective moment, asking about an enjoyable activity. the brevity and simplicity of the statement further reduce the likelihood of it stemming from a place of loneliness."
"Merry Christmas Everybody!Seriously, I hope everyone here finds a little joy in their heart.",0,"the narrative conveys a sense of joy and well-wishing towards others, which is not typically indicative of loneliness. the use of the phrase ""merry christmas everybody!"" suggests a desire to connect and spread positive emotions during a festive time. the sentiment expressed in ""i hope everyone here finds a little joy in their heart"" reflects a concern for the well-being of others, which is generally associated with a sense of community and connection rather than isolation. the overall tone is upbeat and inclusive, lacking any signs of distress or longing for companionship that are often seen in narratives of lonely individuals. the absence of self-referential language or expressions of personal sadness further supports the classification."
"I??m reading your posts.We??re all lonely here. We all feel like we??re just dumping our emotions into a void when there??s no response. I??m reading them. I try to respond. If I don??t get to you, I didn??t mean to miss you. Sometimes, it??s all I can do to keep myself going, and I don??t have the strength to pull anyone else along. I??m sure that??s very relatable here. Ill keep trying for me. I??ll keep trying for you.",0,"the narrative expresses a strong sense of community and shared experience, indicating that the author does not feel isolated in their emotions. the acknowledgment of others' posts and the effort to respond show a connection and engagement with others, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. the author's empathy and understanding of the collective struggle suggest they find solace in knowing they are not alone. the mention of trying to support others, even when it is difficult, further emphasizes a sense of belonging and mutual support. these elements collectively point to an individual who, despite facing challenges, does not experience the profound isolation characteristic of loneliness."

I'm a shy and a bit anxious 29 yo person with a European accent, looking for a clean audio call on some app. If you feel like you need someone to talk to, I'm all ears.

I'll try to respond, as long as I'm not offline or asleep, haha :)

P. S. Thank you for having such a wonderful community in this subreddit ????",0,"the narrative showcases an individual who is reaching out to connect with others in a respectful and meaningful way. the person describes themselves as shy and a bit anxious, yet they are proactive in seeking conversations on topics of interest like art, philosophy, music, and literature. this indicates a desire for intellectual and social engagement rather than a plea driven by loneliness. their emphasis on clean, polite conversation and the expression of gratitude towards the community suggest a positive outlook and a sense of belonging. the writer's openness to listening and their careful approach to not delve into urgent mental health matters reflect a balanced and thoughtful attitude. overall, the narrative presents someone who values connection and community, but not from a place of desperation or loneliness."
"Discord server [Friendship] [Relationship] [Chat] [Group] [Activities]Hii, if you want to be part of a discord server with lots of different people send me a DM???",0,"the narrative suggests an individual who is actively seeking social interaction and community engagement by inviting others to join a discord server. this behavior indicates a proactive approach to building relationships and participating in group activities, which are typically not associated with loneliness. the use of multiple positive keywords like ""friendship,"" ""relationship,"" ""chat,"" ""group,"" and ""activities"" further reinforces the impression of someone who is socially connected and looking to expand their social network. the invitation for direct messages (dm) shows openness and a desire for communication, suggesting a level of social confidence and willingness to engage with others. these elements collectively point to a person who is likely not experiencing loneliness."
????????????I'm really hurt by that last message you sent me. ???? bye ????,0,"the narrative reflects a response to a specific incident that has caused emotional pain, indicated by the mention of being hurt by a message. the use of emotive language and the brevity of the statement suggest a reaction to a particular event rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the presence of direct communication with another person implies an existing social connection, even if it is currently strained. this context suggests that the individual is engaged in social interactions and is affected by them, which is not typically consistent with feelings of loneliness. instead, the narrative highlights a moment of interpersonal conflict or disappointment, which can occur independently of loneliness."
"Friends anyone?i??m 13 and turning 14 this month. I produce music, from beats to vocals.

Need somebody to talk to :)nan,0,"the narrative indicates a simple and straightforward request for someone to talk to, accompanied by a smiley face, which suggests a casual and light-hearted tone. the brevity and use of an emoticon imply that the individual may not be experiencing deep or chronic loneliness. instead, it appears to be a momentary desire for social interaction rather than a profound sense of isolation. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include more detailed expressions of sadness, despair, or a sense of being disconnected from others. the absence of such indicators in this narrative supports the classification. the casual nature of the message and the positive emoticon further highlight that the person is likely reaching out for a brief social connection rather than expressing a deeper emotional need."
I need a hug.In person. I want to feel that closure. I need a shoulder to cry on and tell me it's going to be okay.,0,"the narrative reflects a strong desire for physical and emotional comfort, which is a common human need and not necessarily an indicator of loneliness. the expression of wanting a hug and a shoulder to cry on suggests a moment of vulnerability and seeking reassurance, but it does not inherently imply a persistent state of loneliness. many people experience times when they need extra support, especially during stressful or emotional periods. the use of phrases like ""i need a hug"" and ""tell me it is going to be okay"" can be seen as reaching out for temporary solace rather than a chronic feeling of isolation. this context suggests that the individual is likely going through a challenging time and is looking for immediate emotional relief, which is a normal response to life's difficulties and not indicative of a deeper, ongoing sense of loneliness."

and I just want to not exist. i feel an ache in my chest that sometimes is apparent and i know it is my mind making it physically known that i am not well, i am not happy. i am tired and sleep doesn??t bring me energy.",0,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of disconnection and isolation. the author describes a lack of significant social interactions and experiences, such as attending friends' parties, engaging in romantic relationships, or having a supportive family. these experiences are critical for forming social bonds and a sense of belonging. the mention of feeling alien to the world and the physical manifestations of their mental state, such as an ache in the chest and fatigue that sleep does not alleviate, are strong indicators of psychological distress. the narrative also highlights the author's struggle with making friends and feeling like an outsider, which exacerbates their sense of loneliness. despite having a boyfriend, the author feels that this relationship has not mitigated their feelings of isolation or integrated them into society. these elements collectively paint a picture of someone experiencing deep loneliness and a lack of connection to the world around them."
"Why am I always the third wheel?In every single group of friends i'm always the third wheel. It has always been like this, it even happened of people to invite me to hangout but then tell me I shouldn't because other people would go in my place. I just wish I could understand why i'm so worthless, i think no one likes depressed people. All i want is a friendly hug and a friend who won't just use me as a third wheel.",0,"the narrative describes a recurring experience of feeling like the third wheel in social situations, highlighting a sense of exclusion and worthlessness. the writer mentions being invited and then uninvited to hangouts, which suggests a pattern of social rejection. the desire for a friendly hug and a genuine friend indicates a need for emotional connection and validation. while these elements may seem indicative of loneliness, the narrative lacks deeper emotional introspection or expressions of prolonged isolation that are often present in those experiencing significant loneliness. instead, it focuses more on specific incidents of social exclusion rather than a pervasive sense of being alone."
Broken heart syndrome[deleted],0,"the narrative does not present typical indicators of loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, lack of social connections, or a sense of being misunderstood, which are common signs of loneliness. instead, the narrative appears to focus on a specific emotional experience related to a broken heart, which, while distressing, does not inherently suggest a pervasive sense of loneliness. the absence of references to ongoing struggles with social relationships or an enduring sense of emptiness further supports the classification. this suggests that the individual may be experiencing acute emotional pain but not necessarily the chronic, persistent feelings associated with loneliness."

"Zero friends (18f)Well. I'll jump into it. I moved around to about 5 different highschools and 3 elementary schools throughout grades 7-12. The first few times I was always looking to make friends, it also helped that I was still younger. But after moving a million more times and into cities where the people were much less friendly I gave up and would always just be on my own. Grades 11 and 12 I would eat lunch by myself everyday, never knowing what to do and often just sitting on the stairs on my phone or something. I'm a 5'11 female and due to my quietness people usually think I'm either intimidating or weird. I have major social anxiety and anxiety in general so that probably doesn't help. I don't get along with my family. And I don't really have aunts or uncles or grandparents who we don't have a restraining order against or who aren't dead. I graduated alone. Watching everyone else with their friend groups taking group pics was horrible. Never went to any parties. Don't even remember the last time I went to a birthday party or a stay the night type thing. I'm an introvert as well, so my routines from day to day are basically the same. I have a job, but it's at a dealership and I'm literally the youngest and only female in the shop so I can't really make friends in there other than having friendly coworker conversations with the 28 year old+ guys. I've tried stupid things like those apps for making friends but I can never get past the talking stage and I'd rather meet someone in person. Just feeling super alone",0,"the narrative describes a series of life experiences characterized by frequent relocations, social isolation, and a lack of meaningful connections. despite moving multiple times during critical school years, the individual struggled to form lasting friendships, eventually giving up on trying to connect with others. the person’s social anxiety and introverted nature further compounded the difficulty in establishing relationships. the description of spending lunch periods alone, feeling out of place during significant social events like graduation, and not participating in typical social activities like parties indicates a persistent sense of isolation. the lack of supportive family relationships and the challenge of being the only young female in a male-dominated workplace add to the sense of disconnection. the use of apps to make friends, which ultimately proved unsuccessful, underscores the struggle to form meaningful bonds. the overall tone of the narrative conveys a deep feeling of loneliness and the desire for companionship, but also a resignation to the current state of solitude."
Well good night everyoneI'm tired been up since the morning finally gonna go to sleep good night ????,0,"the narrative reflects a routine and typical end-of-day sentiment, which does not exhibit signs of loneliness. the use of ""everyone"" suggests the author is addressing a group, indicating social interaction or a sense of community. the expression of tiredness and the decision to go to sleep are common daily experiences that do not inherently suggest loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, longing for companionship, or any emotional distress typically associated with loneliness. the straightforward and neutral tone further supports the absence of loneliness in this narrative."
"Why dosen't anyone love meI feel like no one loves me. I cried today while hugging a pillow..  i feel like im unlovable, disliked, and everything in between. I crie every day every night, i want someone to hold... someone to fall asleep while facetiming them. I want someone to cuddle. To feel the heat of another person. I never thought i would get this down. Im the class clown, i trie to make everyone laugh and feel good, my ""friends"" are ignoring me. I went to the roller done today and accidentally touched a girls hand. Thats the only females touch i have felt in a while except for family... i saw a cute girl with nice skates and i was going to compliment her skates but i went into the bathroom and busted out crying. I thought i wasn't good enough and that im to ugly to get with a girl like that. Its sad to know that i had a big ego and now its small. Thinking i could never do anything important... so i drown out those thoughts with cod",0,"the narrative reveals a profound sense of despair and a longing for connection. the individual expresses feelings of being unloved and unlovable, which are articulated through their daily crying and desire for physical affection. despite their efforts to make others laugh and feel good, they feel ignored by their friends, highlighting a discrepancy between their outward persona and internal experience. their emotional response to simple interactions, such as accidentally touching a girl's hand or seeing someone they find attractive, underscores their deep-seated insecurities and lack of self-worth. the individual's recourse to video games as a means to drown out negative thoughts suggests a coping mechanism to deal with their emotional pain. these aspects, such as the crying, longing for connection, feelings of inadequacy, and use of distraction, are indicative of someone grappling with loneliness and low self-esteem."
ventingive been using drugs to cope with my loneliness &amp; depression for about 3-4 days now &amp; it??s worked perfectly fine until i ran out. now im sober &amp; im back to feeling constant emotional pain &amp; misery + loneliness &amp; it seriously sucks because my only 2 thoughts are i wanna die &amp; i need to get high so i can??t k*ll myself.,0,"the narrative describes an individual using drugs to cope with emotional pain and misery, and highlights a return to these feelings once the drugs are no longer available. they mention experiencing constant emotional pain, misery, and loneliness, and express thoughts of wanting to die and needing to get high to prevent self-harm. while these are serious and concerning symptoms of depression and substance dependence, the narrative does not solely focus on social isolation or the absence of meaningful connections, which are key indicators of loneliness. instead, the emphasis is on the struggle with addiction and the overwhelming emotional distress, suggesting that the primary issue might be more related to substance abuse and depression rather than loneliness."
"I want a relationship so badI have a couple good friend but i always feel like ive missed out bc im 19 and have barely even went on a date and all i can think about these days is how i just want somone to be in an intimate relationship with who cares about me and we can just lay on a couch and watch movies, go out, whatever. Anyone else?",0,"the narrative expresses a strong desire for an intimate relationship and mentions feeling like they've missed out due to limited dating experiences at the age of 19. despite this longing, the individual acknowledges having a couple of good friends, indicating a support system and social connections. the focus on wanting a relationship seems more about seeking a new experience and emotional connection rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation. the desire to share activities like watching movies and going out with someone special suggests a normal yearning for companionship typical of young adults, rather than a profound sense of loneliness. the mention of good friends implies that the individual does not feel completely isolated, which is a critical factor in distinguishing between loneliness and a simple desire for romantic involvement."
"What It Feels Like To Lose SomeoneI??m in so much emotional pain, it feels like I just got smacked by a huge wave and I??ve been dragged onto the wet sand and I??m coughing and attempting to breath at the same time. But also, it feels like I??m drowning and no one is there to save me as I reach my arms out for help.",0,"the narrative vividly describes the intense emotional pain associated with loss, using powerful imagery such as being smacked by a huge wave and drowning. these metaphors convey a deep sense of grief and despair. however, the focus is primarily on the immediate, acute pain of losing someone rather than the chronic, pervasive feeling of loneliness. the author's expressions of feeling overwhelmed and struggling to breathe highlight the raw, visceral impact of grief. while the narrative mentions a lack of help, it does not delve into a broader context of social isolation or prolonged absence of meaningful connections, which are more typical indicators of loneliness. the acute nature of the emotional pain described is more aligned with the experience of mourning rather than an ongoing state of loneliness."

I??m so tired of having failure after fucking failure that??s all my fault every fucking goddamn time because I??m such a selfish dickhead and don??t even fucking know it. Fuck my life.",0,"the narrative expresses a profound sense of frustration and self-blame regarding the individual's experiences with dating. the person details a recurring pattern of initial connection followed by eventual rejection, which leads to intense emotional distress. phrases like ""i??m so tired of the heartbreak"" and ""i??m so tired of constantly seeing the girls who once loved me moving on"" suggest a cycle of emotional turmoil and perceived personal failure. the repeated use of strong language and self-deprecating terms such as ""selfish dickhead"" and ""failure"" indicate a deep-seated self-criticism. however, despite the negative emotions and harsh self-assessment, the narrative does not explicitly reflect the isolation or lack of social connections typically associated with loneliness. instead, it highlights a specific context of romantic relationships and the individual's response to repeated disappointments within that sphere."

SERIOUSLY????? I WILL NOT HAVE A GOOD DAY NOT AFTER WHAT YOU REPLIED WITH ????",0,"the narrative depicts a moment of frustration and disappointment in response to a friend's dismissive reaction. the writer expresses a desire to be heard and understood but feels invalidated by the friend's superficial encouragement. despite the emotional intensity, the underlying context suggests a situational irritation rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the writer's ability to articulate their feelings and the presence of a social interaction indicate that they are engaged in relationships, even if those interactions are sometimes unsatisfactory. such experiences of momentary discontent are common and do not necessarily reflect chronic loneliness."
Anyone wanna talk for a while? Just pm menan,0,"the narrative indicates a desire for social interaction, which can be a normal part of human behavior and does not necessarily imply loneliness. the request for someone to talk to is casual and open-ended, suggesting the individual might simply be looking for a way to pass the time or engage in a pleasant conversation. there is no mention of feeling isolated, disconnected, or experiencing emotional distress, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the tone seems light and informal, which aligns more with someone who is socially proactive rather than lonely. the brevity and directness of the message also imply a sense of confidence and comfort in reaching out to others."
"IDK if it??s me, but it sure feels like everyone is in a relationship.Just got news that my one friend has a girlfriend, another is engaged. I checked Facebook - 3 people got married. People all over my campus were holding hands. What is going on?

And this is all in the span of two weeks. It can??t just be me right?",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of observation and comparison rather than an expression of personal emotional distress or isolation. the individual notes the relationship statuses of friends and acquaintances, but the tone is more curious and bewildered than deeply saddened or longing. there is no explicit mention of feeling left out, abandoned, or yearning for companionship. the narrative lacks the introspective and emotive language typically associated with loneliness, such as feelings of emptiness, despair, or a strong desire for social connection. instead, the focus is on external events and a broader social phenomenon, which suggests that the person is more puzzled by the prevalence of relationships around them rather than feeling personally affected or isolated."
Does it ever stop hurting?nan,0,"the narrative presents a brief and poignant question that suggests the presence of emotional pain. however, the absence of specific details or context makes it challenging to conclude definitively that the individual is experiencing loneliness. the question ""does it ever stop hurting?"" could pertain to various forms of distress, such as grief, physical pain, or other emotional struggles, not necessarily loneliness. typically, narratives from individuals experiencing loneliness include descriptions of social isolation, a lack of meaningful connections, or feelings of being misunderstood or unseen by others. since this narrative lacks such indicators, it does not align strongly with common signs of loneliness. thus, while the author is clearly in pain, the narrative does not provide enough evidence to suggest that this pain is specifically due to loneliness."
"My friends made me realize that it??s been so long since I??ve felt romantic loveMe, my brother and our mutual friend we??re hanging out together and talking. My brother was calling his girlfriend and they??re doing that love talk crap. It was making me uncomfortable so I said to call or down. One asked me how many girlfriends I had which I respond with 1. He proceeds to tell me I don??t really know what he??s feeling. I had but it been so long. For the past while I??ve been actively looking for a girlfriend only to no avail. I??m considering giving up. There is so many things wrong with me I can??t even come up on anyone??s radar.",0,"the narrative describes an individual reflecting on their discomfort with romantic interactions and their difficulty in finding a girlfriend. while the person expresses some frustration and self-doubt, these feelings are contextualized within specific social interactions rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the mention of friends and a brother indicates a presence of social connections, which suggests that the individual is not entirely devoid of social support. the focus on romantic relationships and the self-perceived inadequacies in this domain do not necessarily imply overall loneliness but rather a specific area of personal concern. the narrative lacks broader indicators of loneliness, such as a general absence of meaningful relationships or a deep-seated feeling of being disconnected from others."

Pretty bummed right now and would welcome some company.",0,"the narrative describes an individual who is spending thanksgiving alone due to a slight cold and the need to protect family members with compromised immune systems. while the person expresses disappointment about being alone and missing out on a birthday celebration, there are no strong indicators of chronic loneliness. the individual seems to have meaningful relationships and is mindful of their family's health. the desire for company appears situational and temporary, tied specifically to the holiday and their current health situation. the context suggests that under normal circumstances, this person is not isolated and has social connections, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
35 year old femaleI'm a 35 year old mother from PA I'm looking for a man to satisfy my needs,0,"the narrative describes a 35-year-old mother from pennsylvania who is seeking a man to fulfill her needs. this description does not inherently suggest loneliness but rather a specific desire or goal. the absence of language indicating feelings of isolation, sadness, or a lack of social connections is notable. instead, the narrative focuses on an active pursuit of a relationship, which implies a sense of agency and purpose. the straightforward and concise nature of the statement lacks emotional depth that might be present in someone experiencing loneliness. overall, the narrative reflects a clear intention and does not exhibit common signs of loneliness such as expressing feelings of being misunderstood, disconnected, or longing for companionship in a broader sense."
Don??t assume you know me by what you??ve heard.nan,0,"the narrative suggests a defensive stance, possibly indicating a desire for individuality and a resistance to being stereotyped or misunderstood. this assertiveness and the emphasis on not being defined by others' perceptions can be indicative of a strong sense of self and independence. individuals experiencing loneliness often exhibit signs of seeking connection or expressing feelings of isolation, neither of which are present here. instead, the focus is on a clear boundary-setting and a declaration of self-identity, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
I wish I could??ve just had the normal human experienceGod damn why am I such a fucking freak,0,"the narrative expresses frustration and self-deprecation, but it lacks clear indicators of loneliness. the use of strong language and the desire for a ""normal human experience"" suggest feelings of inadequacy or self-criticism rather than isolation. there is no mention of social disconnection, absence of relationships, or feelings of being alone, which are common indicators of loneliness. instead, the focus is on internal conflict and self-perception, which can be associated with other psychological issues but not necessarily loneliness."
"Why do I feel like I'm the worst person living on this earth?Whatever I do, whatever I think, whatever I say, I feel like im a total douchebag, even though Im not. I just feel guilty for every move I make. My friends say otherwise, but I still feel like something is wrong with me, someting I hate in myself but can't figure it out. When I talk to a girl I always think that ""did I say something bad? Do i look rapey? Does she think im a dumbass?""",0,"the narrative reveals a deep sense of self-doubt and self-criticism, where the individual feels like they are inherently flawed despite reassurance from friends. this pervasive guilt and negative self-perception can be indicative of low self-esteem or anxiety, but not necessarily loneliness. the presence of friends and social interactions, even though the individual questions their behavior and perceptions, suggests that they are not isolated. they are engaging with others and receiving feedback, which is inconsistent with the typical indicators of loneliness such as social withdrawal, lack of social connections, or feelings of being alone despite being in a crowd. the narrative focuses more on internal struggles with self-worth rather than an absence of social support or companionship."
"i hate peoplewhy are people so horrible? why is it so hard for me to interact with them? it??s like only if i??ve known them for at least a few months i finally start actually talking to them. people i don??t know at all freak me the fuck out. i hate facing or talking to strangers, i hate the idea of them knowing things about me or assuming things about me. im actually pretty jealous of people that can easily talk to anyone or people that have a lot of friends. i want to be happy in life and enjoy it with fellow humans around me. but everyone seems so rude and self centered and it makes me hate the world.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep frustration with social interactions and a strong aversion to engaging with strangers. the individual expresses a sense of jealousy towards those who can easily make friends and socialize, which suggests an awareness of their own social challenges. however, the narrative also indicates a desire for meaningful connections and a longing to enjoy life with others, despite the negative perception of people as rude and self-centered. this combination of social anxiety, frustration, and a yearning for connection points to someone struggling with social integration rather than experiencing profound loneliness. their issues seem more related to social anxiety and a critical view of others, rather than an absence of social bonds or an acute sense of isolation."
I have reached a dead end in life...nan,0,"the narrative describes a feeling of reaching a dead end in life, which suggests a sense of hopelessness or stagnation. however, this does not necessarily indicate loneliness. the absence of any mention of social isolation, lack of companionship, or feelings of being disconnected from others suggests that the individual's struggle may be more related to personal or existential issues rather than loneliness. typically, indicators of loneliness would include expressions of missing social interactions, feeling left out, or yearning for meaningful connections, none of which are present in this brief narrative. the focus here is more on an internal crisis rather than a social one."
"I feel trapped in my own skinFor the most part I enjoy being alone. I don??t have to worry about being forgotten or trying to please someone. Don??t have to worry about getting into arguments or wondering if I did something wrong. Don??t have to worry about trying to be someone to somebody. Yet the thought of you always comes to me, and I end up seeing you in my dreams. I feel whole until I wake, and then I??m alone once more. Another day trying to convince myself I am fine being alone.",0,"the narrative describes a person who finds solace in solitude, appreciating the freedom from social pressures and conflicts. the individual mentions enjoying the absence of the need to please others or engage in potentially problematic interactions. however, they also express a recurring longing for someone specific, which appears in their dreams, leading to a transient feeling of completeness. upon waking, they return to their solitary state but actively work to convince themselves of their contentment with being alone. this indicates a level of self-awareness and acceptance of their solitary lifestyle, despite occasional moments of yearning. the balance between appreciating solitude and experiencing fleeting desires for companionship suggests a nuanced perspective that does not align with deep-seated loneliness. the narrative reveals an individual who is mostly at peace with their solitude, demonstrating typical indicators of non-loneliness such as self-sufficiency, contentment with alone time, and a lack of distress about their solitary state."

Anyway, Happy New Year to you all!!",0,"the narrative presents a casual inquiry about new year's eve plans, which is a common topic of conversation. while the author mentions spending the evening alone and acknowledges that having company would be nice, the tone remains light and non-distressed. the use of phrases like ""kinda sucks but hey ho"" suggests a level of acceptance and resignation rather than deep emotional pain or isolation. the overall tone is friendly and includes a cheerful greeting, ""happy new year to you all!!,"" which indicates a desire for social interaction and connection rather than a focus on personal loneliness. these elements suggest that the author is not deeply affected by loneliness, but rather casually acknowledging a temporary situation without significant emotional distress."

I want the never ending solitude to go away.,0,"the narrative expresses a deep sense of longing for connection and an intense desire to be seen and heard, which are common indicators of loneliness. the mention of ""never ending solitude"" highlights the individual's perception of persistent isolation. these feelings and expressions are typical of someone experiencing loneliness, as they reflect a craving for social interaction and emotional support. the desire to escape solitude and the emphasis on being acknowledged by others suggest a significant emotional need that is unmet. psychological insights suggest that such expressions are often rooted in a lack of meaningful relationships or social engagement, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation."
"How would you like people to Contact/Help you from This subreddit?(Hopefully this is allowed!) 

I was thinking early today as I was reading Posts here, How would you like people to contact/help you in DMs? 

Would you like them to let you vent and try to be supportive OR would you just want a nice causal conversation where you get to vent but also talk to someone about Random things? 

This Subreddit helped me a lot at the start of January, I am really grateful for the people who contacted me and didn??t pressure me to talk about it but still offered me tons of support. So I??d like to help others the same way I received Help. But I am wondering whats the best way to do it? 

Lastly, Don??t feel pressured to reply to people daily, we all know sometimes we need our space or even not reply to a certain person (I am guilty of that lol) just don??t pressure yourself, this is a safe space, so don??t put too much pressure and responsibilities on yourself (Conversations and carrying it can be a draining thing, I understand that far too well too) my point is, Do whats right FOR YOU. and if the other person doesn??t understand, oh well. Right? 

Just something I was thinking about and thought ??Lets start a conversation about it?? Have a nice day everyone ????",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of community and mutual support, which are indicators of social connectedness rather than loneliness. the author expresses gratitude for the help received from others and shows a desire to reciprocate that support. this demonstrates a feeling of being valued and connected to a group. the focus on how to best support others, the recognition of personal boundaries, and the encouragement to take care of oneself are signs of empathy and understanding. these elements suggest the author is in a supportive environment and feels a sense of belonging, which are contrary to feelings of loneliness. the narrative is filled with positive reinforcement and a proactive approach to maintaining healthy interactions, further indicating the presence of a supportive social network."

"The Group TherapistI always find myself as the ""therapist friend"" and it's bitter sweet. On one hand, it's comforting knowing that I can provide a safe space for my friends to feel like they can confide in me. On the other hand, when I need to talk, the calls go to voicemail. I guess I just can't expect people to return the favor. It makes me feel so isolated and lonely that I don't have them to turn to when I was there for them. Is my heart too big? Am I giving too much?",0,"the narrative reflects an individual who finds comfort in being a supportive friend, indicating a sense of purpose and connection with others. the person takes pride in providing a safe space for friends to confide in, which suggests they have meaningful relationships and are valued by their peers. although they express feelings of isolation when their support is not reciprocated, these moments seem to be specific instances rather than a pervasive state of loneliness. the individual is introspective, questioning whether they are giving too much, which shows self-awareness and a desire for balance in their relationships. overall, the narrative demonstrates a mix of satisfaction and occasional frustration, but it does not convey a consistent or overwhelming sense of loneliness."

Until I get the call...,0,"the narrative reflects a deep sense of introspection and self-expression through poetry, which can be a healthy outlet for processing emotions. while the individual describes feelings of smallness, being ignored, and struggling with self-worth, these experiences are not uncommon and can be part of the broader human condition. the mention of creating a poem suggests a level of engagement and creativity that indicates the person is actively coping with their emotions. the expectation of receiving a call implies a connection to others and a sense of hope or purpose, which counters the idea of profound loneliness. overall, the narrative reveals a person navigating complex emotions but still maintaining social ties and a creative outlet, which are important factors in mitigating loneliness."
How do people even cope working and doing the same shit all day?We dont even have any freedoms man. Working just to pay the Bills to make someone else rich. In top of that having no friends. Like wtf is this life?,0,"the narrative expresses frustration and discontent with the monotony of daily life and the perceived lack of freedom in working to pay bills and enrich others. however, it does not exhibit clear signs of loneliness. while the author mentions having no friends, the focus is more on societal and systemic dissatisfaction rather than personal emotional isolation. the tone conveys anger and resentment towards the economic system rather than sadness or longing for social connection, which are more indicative of loneliness. the narrative lacks the introspective or emotional depth typically associated with loneliness, such as feelings of abandonment, longing for companionship, or emotional pain from social disconnection. instead, it centers on a broader critique of work-life structures and societal expectations."
"Don't you just hate it when someone stops talking to you all of a sudden, without any particular reason.I was really good friends with a person I met online about 4 years ago now. Used to talk lots. I used to send her handmade bday cards too, and even she made a handmade card for me. We were talking normally about two weeks back ......and that's it. For some reason she is just ignoring me like anything. Nothing even happened. She is just not responding anymore. And how ik that she's there but just ignoring me is because I can still see her posting statuses. And this is just one example, I've faced this exact scenario with 1-2 people more, one was very recent, in which I was talking to a person on here and we were getting along so well, and then she just stopped msging....just like that,fir days. I'm never atleast given an explanation as to if I did anything wrong, I'm just left their wondering what did I do? Ik that I wasn't rude or hurtful, one thing ik about me for sure is I always put others above myself and listen to them, try to make them laugh etc. So it srsly hurts when I have no idea and am just figuring out if I'm a piece of shit that no one wants to talk to. I've never really had close frnds, always kinda been lonely and alone, and especially in current lockdown, stuff like this definitely doesn't help. Well, maybe I just overthink a lot because I have a low self esteem, or there is something wrong with me.",0,"the narrative describes a series of interpersonal disappointments and feelings of confusion when online friends suddenly stop communicating. the individual recounts instances where they invested effort into maintaining friendships, such as making handmade cards, only to be met with unresponsiveness. despite these experiences, the narrative reflects a sense of self-awareness and introspection, as the person contemplates whether their actions might have contributed to the outcomes. they acknowledge their tendency to overthink and attribute some of their feelings to low self-esteem. the lockdown context is mentioned, but the narrative does not convey an overwhelming sense of isolation or despair typically associated with loneliness. instead, it highlights frustration and a desire for understanding in social interactions. the person's awareness of their behavior and efforts to connect with others indicate a level of social engagement and resilience that suggests they are not experiencing profound loneliness."
"What else can I say.I don't know if that has any relation to the issues going on in America. I live in Japan teaching English with a passion in film and writing. I commit to them everyday. I've had a good few weeks adjusting to my new lifestyle, and I had to think about what is going on in America today in between my classes. I am quite disgusted with the issues of racism. I talked to my father on the phone and told him that I wish I can do something about it but I can't. My stories will never change the state of the world and make it better. I put a lot of my anger and hatred into my stories. It gives me a certain amount of meaning for myself and it fights my loneliness here in Japan. He told me you don't know that and I asked him did Hayao Miyazaki destroy racism with his stories? He didn't. Miyazaki said you should try to change the world even if it doesn't. He is right. You can't change anything. Forgive my rambling. I had to let this out and don't know where else to post this. I am not a political person so I would rather not talk about this in some politics subreddit. I don't think my voice and everyone's voice will change anything.",0,"the narrative reflects a person who is deeply engaged in their passions and has successfully adjusted to a new lifestyle in japan. the individual mentions teaching english and their dedication to film and writing, which indicates a strong sense of purpose and commitment. although they express frustration and anger about the state of the world, particularly issues of racism in america, these emotions are channeled into their creative work, providing a sense of meaning and fulfillment. the conversation with their father reveals a supportive relationship, and despite feelings of helplessness in effecting change, the narrative does not convey a sense of isolation or disconnection from others. the mention of fighting loneliness suggests that they are aware of it but actively combating it through their creative outlets and maintaining connections with family. overall, the narrative displays a proactive approach to personal challenges and a supportive social network, which are not typical indicators of loneliness."
"I can do itI am a lucky person and I can become the person that I want to be. I can do this. Right now, it is just the middle stage. I can do this.",0,"the narrative reflects a sense of optimism and self-assurance. the repeated affirmations of ""i can do this"" and ""i am a lucky person"" suggest a positive mindset and a belief in personal agency. this kind of language typically indicates resilience and confidence rather than loneliness. the focus on becoming the person one wants to be and recognizing the current situation as a ""middle stage"" implies a forward-looking perspective and a goal-oriented attitude. these elements collectively point towards an individual who is likely well-connected with their sense of purpose and self-worth, which are not common indicators of loneliness."
"Play videos to drown out Stark quiet homeSo I'm 22 and I live alone, and I can't tell if im addicted to YouTube or I'm just constantly in need of content playing to drown out the Stark quietness of living alone. It's actually bad I need it while I pee, brush my teeth, in the shower, right before I sleep, when I was the dishes. Any waking moment I'm playing a show or a podcast. Anyone else like this?",0,"the narrative describes a young adult who lives alone and constantly plays videos to fill the silence in their home. while this behavior might seem indicative of loneliness, it can also be understood as a coping mechanism for the discomfort of silence or a habit formed out of a desire for constant stimulation. the individual does not express feelings of sadness, isolation, or a desire for social connection, which are more direct indicators of loneliness. instead, they focus on their reliance on content to fill their environment, suggesting a preference for background noise rather than an emotional need for companionship. the inquiry about whether others share this behavior indicates a curiosity about common habits rather than an expression of loneliness. thus, the narrative lacks the emotional depth and specific indicators typically associated with loneliness, such as feelings of emptiness, longing for social interaction, or distress over being alone."
Lonely?! Cum see me ????????[removed],0,"the narrative reflects a tone of invitation and engagement rather than isolation. the use of exclamation marks and question marks suggests an attempt to reach out and connect with others. this type of proactive communication is often indicative of someone who is socially active and seeking interaction. the phrase ""come see me"" implies a desire for company and indicates that the person is not withdrawn or avoiding social contact. overall, the language and intent behind the message suggest a mindset that is not characterized by loneliness, but rather by a willingness to engage and be present with others."
Lonely everywhere.[deleted],0,"the narrative is extremely brief and lacks context, which can be indicative of a variety of emotional states. the phrase ""lonely everywhere"" suggests a pervasive feeling, but without additional information or elaboration, it's challenging to ascertain the depth or persistence of this sentiment. the fact that the narrative was deleted may indicate a reluctance to share or a change in the individual's emotional state. in this case, the absence of detailed personal experiences, emotional reflections, or descriptions of social interactions makes it difficult to definitively identify loneliness. typically, narratives from lonely individuals include specific instances of isolation, longing for connection, or descriptions of unfulfilled social needs. the lack of such details here suggests that the narrative may not be from someone experiencing significant loneliness."
You know you??re a loner when all it takes is for someone to text you once on snapchat to be your ??best friend.??It??s kind of funny when I think about it. And I texted this person a week ago.,0,"the narrative suggests a self-awareness and humor about the situation, indicating a level of comfort and acceptance with their social interactions. the person finds it amusing that a single text on snapchat could elevate someone to the status of ""best friend,"" which implies they do not take the concept too seriously. this light-hearted approach and the fact that they reached out to someone a week ago shows they are engaging in social behavior and maintaining connections, even if minimal. the casual tone and lack of emotional distress or longing in the narrative are key indicators that the individual is not experiencing significant loneliness."
My best friend blocked meMy best friend and one of my only friends just blocked me on all social media. I so fcking bad right now I dont know what to do... I dont want to continue living without her in my life...,0,"the narrative describes a distressing experience of losing a close friend, which is undoubtedly a painful event. however, the focus here is on the acute emotional response to a specific incident rather than a pervasive sense of loneliness. the intensity of the feelings expressed, such as not wanting to continue living without the friend, highlights the importance of this particular relationship. yet, this does not necessarily indicate a broader, ongoing experience of loneliness. the individual mentions having other friends, which suggests that their social support network is not entirely absent. the reaction appears to be more about the loss of a significant relationship rather than a chronic state of feeling isolated or disconnected from others."
"It's impossible to not feel like a monster when you're a virgin.When sex is one of the most human and universal experiences that people have, it really makes me feel like a monster that I didn't lose my virginity at a socially acceptable age. What really gets me is that I could've prevented ending up like this if I was just a better person when I was younger. I have no one else to blame but myself for this shit. I genuinely don't feel like a human being, how can I say I'm a person worthy of being alive and being loved when I can't even form these intimate connections with others. I'm so depressed and alone and I know that no amount of going to the gym or working hard in medical school will ever fix what's wrong with me.

I'm tired of people telling me being a virgin isn't worth being suicidal over, and I'm tired of people saying I have a mental illness and need help. Anybody would feel the same way if they were put in my shoes. Human beings are not meant to be alone this long, and I know I've probably suffered permanent brain damage and developmental abnormalities from being like this. I absolutely hate my life and no amount of self-acceptance will ever change that. I will never accept that I can be happy being this way when it was my fault I ended up like this. I will carry this pain for the rest of my life, and that genuinely makes me not want to go on anymore.",0,"the narrative reflects deep self-loathing and a profound sense of inadequacy stemming from the author's virginity. the individual perceives their lack of sexual experience as a significant personal failing, leading to feelings of being monstrous and unworthy of love and connection. they express intense regret and self-blame, believing that their current state could have been avoided if they had been a better person in the past. the narrative also conveys a strong sense of isolation and hopelessness, with the author feeling that no external efforts, such as physical fitness or academic success, can remedy their internal anguish. they reject reassurances from others and are convinced that their condition has caused irreversible damage to their mental and emotional well-being. the expression of such deep despair and the belief that their pain is unchangeable are indicative of a severe psychological struggle. the narrative is a poignant reflection of the individual's inner turmoil and their struggle to find a sense of belonging and self-worth."
"Why me? Why me out of everyone?I was friends with this girl, i fell in love with her...and the rest is the same corny story...i was too nervous to confess but last night i decided to do it. I confessed and she confessed she liked me too. I was the happiest i could be this morning. Then i told my friend about this, and turns out he was interested in her too. I was confused, didnt know what to do. I couldve chosen not to tell her about him but something about it didnt feel right. I told her about him and they talked(they knew each other for very long). They talked and she decided that she liked him more than me. She said that she still wanted to be friends with me but i just couldnt stay there. I ran, i ran home i cried and cried for hours. Now i feel dead inside. I just have one question, why did this happen to me? ive been single for 19 years, this was my first time opening up to a girl and this happened. Am i meant to be alone? Should i just give up?",0,"the narrative expresses intense emotional pain and confusion following a romantic rejection, which is a common experience in young adulthood. the author describes feelings of betrayal and heartbreak, which are typical responses to such situations. however, despite the evident distress, the narrative does not exhibit signs of chronic loneliness. the author has friends and social connections, as indicated by their interaction with the girl and the friend. the pain seems situational rather than a pervasive sense of isolation. the questioning of self-worth and the feeling of being ""dead inside"" are acute emotional reactions to a specific event rather than indicative of an ongoing, deeper loneliness. the author’s ability to articulate their feelings and the presence of significant social interactions suggest that this is a temporary state of emotional turmoil rather than a chronic condition of loneliness."
"Love. Should I even bother to look? Perhaps I am too broken to have it again?Is it wrong for me to want to find love again? It doesn't feel fair to anybody for me to try. My heart still aches from shit that happened a decade ago now. Who the fuck wants to be with somebody with that kind if baggage? To be in love with somebody who I haven't seen or spoke to in years and who more than likely will never wish to talk to me again. 

I fear any potential partner I'm with will be scared away as soon as I talk about my past and I don't think would be fair to hide it from them any woman I could possibly be with I feel deserves to know that shit so they can decide if they want any part of it or not most likely not I would assume. 

Will my feelings of love for her fade away If I could fall for somebody else? I don't think it's fair otherwise? To be in love with two people at the same time? I don't think so.",0,"the narrative reflects a deep introspection about love and the individual's capacity to find it again. the author questions their worthiness and the fairness of seeking new relationships while still harboring feelings for someone from their past. despite the pain and doubt expressed, there is a sense of self-awareness and concern for potential partners' feelings, which indicates a thoughtful and considerate mindset. the author is grappling with unresolved emotions and the fear of rejection, but these concerns are rooted in a desire for honesty and transparency in future relationships. the narrative's focus on past hurt and future possibilities, rather than an overwhelming sense of isolation or lack of connection, suggests that the individual is not necessarily experiencing loneliness but rather dealing with complex emotions related to past relationships and their impact on future ones."
"Partner laughed at the idea Hired Bridesmaids even though I would need that as I gave no friends.The other night I was scrolling through Instagram and an Instagram reel started playing a stupid song. He asked what I was watching, so I told him it was some silly video about hired bridesmaids. He proceeded to laugh and say ""who the heck would need that? That's just sad."" 
But I would need that. I have not a single friend and therefore I wouldn't have bridesmaids if we got married. His words struck me right in the heart as all I could think of is how he would view me as a sad person for needing that service. Add that into the fact I was already thinking I would need to rent a friend for social times (cause I haven't had a friend in 10 years) and it just left me broken. 
I told him how I felt and he did apologise. But I still can't stop thinking about it and how I'm one of those ""sad"" lovely souls who just want a friend for once.",0,"the narrative provides a detailed account of a personal experience that revolves around the protagonist's lack of friends and the emotional impact of their partner's reaction to a video about hired bridesmaids. the description includes specific instances, such as the partner's laughter and the protagonist's realization that they would need to hire bridesmaids due to having no friends. despite the partner's apology, the protagonist continues to feel hurt and ruminates on their situation, feeling labeled as ""sad."" this account reflects the protagonist's deep sense of social isolation and longing for companionship, which are typical indicators of loneliness. the continuous reflection on their social situation and the emotional pain stemming from the partner's reaction further emphasize the loneliness experienced by the protagonist."
"Lonely but on zoom f it31/m just chillen wasted hmu if you wanna just spit bullshit fr

No not nude or trying to f with naked bs, just chillen frfr",0,"the narrative reflects a casual and relaxed demeanor, indicating the author is looking for social interaction but not out of a sense of desperation or deep loneliness. the use of informal language and abbreviations like ""hmu"" (hit me up) and ""frfr"" (for real for real) suggests a laid-back attitude. the author explicitly states they are not seeking anything intimate or serious, which can be interpreted as someone who is comfortable and content with their current social situation. the mention of being on zoom and just wanting to ""spit bullshit"" points to a desire for light-hearted conversation rather than seeking meaningful connections to fill an emotional void. these elements collectively suggest that the author is not experiencing significant loneliness but rather is simply open to casual socializing."

I??m always down to play some mc idc who you are you just need to have discord and need to be around my age and don??t be to shy for a vc now and then so hmu don??t be scared!:3,0,"the narrative reflects an individual who is actively seeking social interaction and companionship through a shared interest in gaming. the repeated enthusiastic invitation to connect and the emphasis on not being shy for voice chats suggest a proactive approach to building friendships. the person's openness to engaging with others, regardless of who they are, indicates a desire for socialization rather than a sense of isolation. the playful tone and use of emoticons further imply a positive and outgoing attitude, which are not typically associated with feelings of loneliness. the narrative lacks any signs of distress, sadness, or longing for connection that are often present in lonely individuals. instead, it showcases a confident and eager effort to form new connections."
Boredawake want to chat,0,"the narrative ""boredawake want to chat"" suggests a desire for social interaction, but it lacks deeper emotional cues that typically indicate loneliness. the phrase ""want to chat"" points to a momentary feeling of boredom rather than a persistent sense of isolation. boredom can often be a transient state, prompting individuals to seek casual conversation to pass the time, rather than a reflection of deeper, chronic loneliness. there is no mention of feelings of sadness, emptiness, or longing for meaningful connections, which are common indicators of loneliness. the brevity and simplicity of the statement also imply a spontaneous need for engagement rather than an ongoing struggle with loneliness. thus, the context and language used do not align with the more complex emotional experiences usually associated with loneliness."
Can someone please help me?[removed],0,"the narrative indicates a straightforward request for assistance without providing additional context or emotional cues that might suggest deeper feelings of isolation or loneliness. the brevity and directness of the message could imply that the author is seeking immediate help for a specific issue rather than expressing an ongoing emotional state. in cases of loneliness, individuals often share more about their feelings of disconnection, lack of social support, or prolonged sadness. the absence of such details in this narrative suggests that the author's primary concern is the need for help rather than an expression of loneliness."
"Need a friend?I??m in desperate need of cash and was hoping we could make a deal: $25 an hour for a face time / zoom call 

I??m an 18 year old female who loves getting to know new people. I??m inclusive of all sexualities, religions, and everything in between. I would be so down to talk about absolutely anything, as long as it isn??t sexual  

PM me if you??re interested, and thanks so much for considering",0,"the narrative suggests an individual seeking financial support through virtual companionship rather than displaying signs of loneliness. the primary focus is on the transactional nature of the interaction, emphasizing the monetary exchange for time spent on facetime or zoom calls. the author describes themselves as an 18-year-old female who enjoys meeting new people and is inclusive of various backgrounds, which indicates a willingness and enthusiasm for social interaction. there is no mention of feelings of isolation, sadness, or a desire for deeper emotional connections that are often associated with loneliness. instead, the narrative is framed as a business proposition, highlighting the author's proactive approach to solving a financial need. this pragmatic and outwardly focused attitude aligns more with someone who is socially engaged and resourceful, rather than someone experiencing loneliness."
"Anyone looking to chat?Im an 18 year old male kinda feeling trapped in a cycle of work with no one to talk to. I have been putting in an effort to meet new people but its not really going anywhere right now.

Im down to talk about anything but If you??re into fitness and health i would love to talk about it as i just started going to the gym and need pointers.",0,"the narrative reflects a desire for social interaction and an active effort to connect with others, particularly through shared interests like fitness and health. the individual mentions feeling trapped in a cycle of work, which suggests some dissatisfaction with their current social situation, but the proactive steps taken to meet new people and engage in conversations indicate resilience and a positive outlook. the invitation to chat about specific topics shows an openness and willingness to form connections, which are not typical indicators of loneliness. instead, these behaviors suggest someone who is navigating social challenges but remains engaged and hopeful about building relationships."
"Need some advice on what I feel is a one sided friendshipI made two close friends in my first year of university, we all stayed in the same residence building. When universities in Canada announced online classes for the rest of the semester in March this year, myself and another friend returned home while one remained in the country. I returned to Kenya and my other friend returned home to Germany. At first things were ok, it was nice to be back home and we kept in touch frequently by gaming together or just video calling each other. Over time however it slowly progressed to a point where I would reach out to them and would get a response a couple of days later. This would make me feel a bit upset but I understood that they're probably occupied with other things. When it was my birthday the friend in Canada forgot about it, which bummed me out quite a bit. 

At the moment it's now reached a point where they either don't respond or acknowledge my messages. I'll get a random snap of the floor or sky every now and then but it's as though any effort I've made to strike up a conversation has gone unnoticed and fallen on deaf ears. I would really appreciate some advice on what exactly to do about this, I tried bringing it up with them but they mentioned that they have been busy at home and don't check Instagram. I then asked if whatsapp would be better to which they said yes, but there was no difference. I don't know why things are like this, from a point where we considered each other family to a point where I feel like I'm being treated as a complete stranger. The signals are very mixed, and I don't know whether I should try and confront them about it or just move on. I can't exactly make friends here in Kenya and they will be returning to online studying in Canada. I'm worried that missing a semester of being there will create a further rift and I'll have to completely start over with making new friends. My apologies for such a long rant, I would appreciate some advice on what to do.

TL;DR: my friends have been extremely unresponsive during the whole lockdown, I'm constantly the one taking the initiative to reach out and they are not responding at all, what should I do?",0,"the narrative describes an individual grappling with a shift in the dynamics of their friendships after moving back home due to the pandemic. while the person feels upset and confused by the lack of responsiveness from their friends, there is a clear understanding that the friends might be preoccupied with their own lives. the individual reflects on the changes in communication patterns and expresses disappointment over the perceived neglect, especially during significant moments like their birthday. however, despite these feelings, the narrative does not convey a pervasive sense of isolation or a deep-seated longing for connection that typically characterizes loneliness. instead, it centers around the frustration and uncertainty of maintaining friendships across distances and the challenges of adapting to new communication norms. the person also mentions their inability to make new friends in their current location, but this is framed more as a logistical issue rather than an emotional one. the request for advice indicates a proactive approach to resolving the situation, suggesting resilience and a willingness to seek solutions rather than a sense of despair or helplessness. overall, the narrative reflects a situational concern about friendship dynamics rather than an underlying experience of loneliness."

"i??m alone.Being openly gay at 16 is so difficult to deal with. I am constantly being used as an experiment or as a toy and it??s honestly so hard and i hate myself that i let it happen.

"Poem about Lonliness and MusicI have no clue if this is the right place to put this, but I wanted to semi-vent through poetry. Here goes.

A cymbal, then a crash.

Who would've known?

This music is like a drug, a stash. 

Healing, it brings me out of the darkness.

Without it, there would be no light. No brightness.

Like a blanket it comforts me, engulfs me, and takes me to a place like no other.

I don't know where I'd be without it. 

Im just glad its chosen me in this moment. Now.",0,"the narrative expresses a deep connection and reliance on music as a source of comfort and healing. the individual describes music as a transformative force that brings light and brightness into their life, suggesting a sense of fulfillment and solace. phrases like ""a blanket it comforts me"" and ""takes me to a place like no other"" indicate that the person finds a significant sense of companionship and emotional support through music. the narrative lacks expressions of isolation or yearning for human connection, which are typical indicators of loneliness. instead, it highlights a positive relationship with music that seems to fulfill their emotional needs."
"If you feel lonely , it doesn't mean that no body likes you !I always thought that no body likes me that's why i don't have friends , but i relaised that many people likes me and maybe the problem is i can't develop a friendship or i just didn't meet people with similar interests !",0,"the narrative reflects a journey of self-discovery and realization rather than persistent loneliness. the author acknowledges feeling lonely at times but counters this with the recognition that people do like them. this insight suggests a level of social awareness and understanding that loneliness isn't necessarily tied to others' perceptions. the mention of realizing the potential difficulty in developing friendships or not meeting people with similar interests points to a practical and hopeful outlook rather than a deep-seated sense of isolation. these elements indicate a healthy mindset focused on self-improvement and understanding social dynamics, which are not typical indicators of chronic loneliness."
